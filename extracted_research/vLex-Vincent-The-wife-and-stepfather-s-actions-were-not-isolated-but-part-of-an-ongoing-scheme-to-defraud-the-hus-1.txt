Question
The wife and stepfather's actions were not isolated but part of an ongoing
scheme to defraud the husband and deprive him of his property and
financial resources. The fraudulent scheme involved multiple steps,
including financial fraud, concealment of funds, and preparation of false
legal documents. Open-ended continuity under RICO exists where the
predicate acts pose a threat of continuing criminal activity, either because
they are part of the entity's regular way of doing business or because the
nature of the acts implies a threat of repetition. The wife's and stepfather's
conduct, involving repeated fraudulent acts and concealment, could be
argued to pose a threat of continuing criminal activity, particularly if the
scheme is ongoing or part of a broader pattern of similar conduct. The
preparation of false legal documents and the crossing of state lines to
further the scheme could indicate an intent to continue the fraudulent
activity, supporting a claim of open-ended continuity.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
The wife's and stepfather's alleged ongoing fraudulent scheme involving
financial fraud, concealment of funds, and preparation of false legal
documents likely satisfies the open-ended continuity requirement under
RICO if these acts constitute a pattern of racketeering activity that poses a
threat of continuing criminal activity. Their coordinated actions involving
multiple steps and crossing state lines could establish a RICO violation if
they demonstrate the predicate acts are related and amount to or pose a
threat of continued criminal activity extending into the future.
Summary
Under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO),
establishing a civil claim requires proving a pattern of racketeering activity
that demonstrates both relationship and continuity. Open-ended continuity,
which is critical to the analysis of the wife's and stepfather's alleged
conduct, can be established by showing that the fraudulent scheme poses a
threat of continuing criminal activity extending indefinitely into the future.
This type of continuity exists when the predicate acts are part of an entity's
regular way of doing business, when they involve a specific threat of
repetition, or when they are attributed to defendants operating as part of a
long-term association that exists for criminal purposes.
The wife's and stepfather's alleged actions—involving financial fraud,
concealment of funds, preparation of false legal documents, and crossing
state lines to further their scheme—likely satisfy the open-ended continuity
requirement if they demonstrate that these coordinated activities were not
isolated events but rather part of an ongoing pattern. Their conduct

suggests a threat of continued criminal activity, particularly if the nature of
their actions indicates an intent to continue the fraudulent activity. The
preparation of false legal documents and interstate activities further
strengthens this argument by demonstrating sophisticated planning and
commitment to an ongoing enterprise designed to defraud the husband of
his property and financial resources.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislation
RICO was enacted as part of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 to
combat organized crime in the United States. The statute provides both
criminal penalties and civil remedies for racketeering activities conducted
as part of an ongoing criminal enterprise.
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1962, it is unlawful for "any person through a pattern of
racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or
maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise
which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce." This provision directly applies to situations where individuals
engage in racketeering activities to gain control over assets or enterprises
affecting interstate commerce.
18 U.S.C. § 1961 defines key terms essential to understanding RICO claims.
"Racketeering activity" includes various criminal acts, such as "any act
which is indictable under any of the following provisions of title 18, United
States Code: ... section 1341 (relating to mail fraud), section 1343 (relating
to wire fraud), section 1344 (relating to financial institution fraud)..."
Additionally, a "pattern of racketeering activity" requires "at least two acts
of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective date of this
chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding any
period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of racketeering
activity."
18 U.S.C. § 1341 criminalizes schemes to defraud involving use of mail or
interstate carriers: "Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any
scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means
of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises... for the
purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do, places
in any post office or authorized depository for mail matter, any matter or
thing whatever to be sent or delivered by the Postal Service, or deposits or
causes to be deposited any matter or thing whatever to be sent or delivered
by any private or commercial interstate carrier... shall be fined under this
title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both."
If the husband can establish a RICO violation, 18 U.S.C. § 1964 provides civil
remedies: "Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a
violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate
United States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he
sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee..."

Case Law on RICO's Pattern Requirement
The Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S.
229 (1989) established the foundational framework for analyzing RICO's
pattern requirement. The Court held that "to prove a 'pattern of
racketeering activity' a plaintiff or prosecutor must show both 'relationship'
and 'continuity'—that the racketeering predicates are related, and that they
either constitute or threaten long-term criminal activity." This decision
created what has become known as the "continuity plus relationship" test.
The "relationship" prong requires that the predicate acts have "the same or
similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or
otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not
isolated events." The Court explained that "continuity" is "centrally a
temporal concept, and may be either closed- or open-ended." For open-
ended continuity, "it must be shown that the predicates establish a threat of
long-term racketeering activity—for example, because the predicates
themselves involve a distinct threat of such activity; because they are part of
the regular way of doing business for an ongoing entity such as a criminal
association or legitimate business; or because they are a regular means of
conducting or participating in an ongoing RICO enterprise."
In Handeen v. Lemaire, 112 F.3d 1339 (8th Cir. 1997), the court further
clarified that even if the acts do not span the years necessary to establish
closed-ended continuity, "the predicates will meet the definition of open-
ended continuity to the extent they 'involve a distinct threat of long-term
racketeering activity.'" This case recognized that the temporal duration of
the predicate acts is not determinative for open-ended continuity, which
instead focuses on the threat of future criminal activity.
The Eighth Circuit in Crest Constr. II, Inc. v. Doe, 660 F.3d 346 (8th Cir.
2011) distinguished between the two types of continuity: "Closed-ended
continuity involves 'a series of related predicates extending over a
substantial period of time;' open-ended continuity involves acts which, by
their nature, threaten repetition into the future."
In Wisdom v. First Midwest Bank, of Poplar Bluff, 167 F.3d 402 (8th Cir.
1999), the court explained that the relationship prong is satisfied if the
predicate acts "have the same or similar purposes, results, participants,
victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by
distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events." For the
continuity prong, the court held that "open-ended continuity involves acts
which, by their nature, threaten repetition into the future."
The Seventh Circuit in Menzies v. Seyfarth Shaw LLP, 943 F.3d 328 (7th Cir.
2019) provided a clear analysis of open-ended continuity, stating that it
"focuses not on what acts occurred in the past but on whether a concrete
threat remains for the conduct to continue moving forward." The court
identified three ways to establish open-ended continuity: "by showing that a
defendant's actions pose a specific threat of repetition; that the predicate
acts form part of the defendant's ongoing and regular way of doing business;

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
or that the defendant operates a long-term association for criminal
purposes."
Demonstrating Open-Ended Continuity
The case of Heinrich v. Waiting Angels Adoption Servs., Inc., 668 F.3d 393
(6th Cir. 2012) elaborated on how to establish open-ended continuity: "the
plaintiffs must plausibly allege that there was a threat of continuing criminal
activity beyond the period during which the predicate acts were performed."
The court emphasized that "a court should consider the totality of the
circumstances surrounding the commission of those acts" rather than
looking exclusively at the predicate acts themselves.
In Ellis v. Warner, CASE NO. 15-10134-CIV-GOODMAN (S.D. Fla. Feb 16,
2017), the court held that "the threat of continuity is sufficiently established
where the predicates can be attributed to a defendant operating as part of a
long-term association that exists for criminal purposes."
Perlman v. Zell, 938 F.Supp. 1327 (N.D. Ill. 1996) provides an example of
how courts analyze the threat of continued criminal activity: "allegations
portray the defendants as employing the modus operandi of regular self-
dealing to the detriment of outside investors, and the fraudulent
manipulation of partnerships' assets to cover their tracks and increase their
personal gains. If true, this picture would suggest a credible threat of
continuing future criminal activity." The court noted that "open-ended
continuity may be shown where the predicate acts 'are part of an ongoing
entity's regular way of doing business'."
Tabas v. Tabas, 47 F.3d 1280 (3rd Cir. 1995), which was later declined to be
extended by Yucaipa Am. All. Fund I, LP v. Ehrlich, No. 16-3664 (3rd Cir.
Nov 15, 2017), still offers valuable insight on open-ended continuity. The
court held that "continuity still would have been established for the
purposes of summary judgment in the present case under an 'open-ended'
continuity analysis" where there exists "a threat of continued racketeering
activity." Despite the subsequent case declining to extend Tabas, the core
analysis regarding open-ended continuity remains applicable, as the
limitation related to other aspects of the decision.
In Heden v. Hill, 937 F.Supp. 1230 (S.D. Tex. 1996), the court identified
several ways to establish a threat of continued racketeering: "(1) the
predicate acts inherently involve a distinct threat of long-term criminal
activity; (2) the entity exists for the purpose of engaging in criminal activity;
or (3) the predicate acts are a regular way of conducting an ongoing
legitimate business."
RICO Enterprise Requirements
United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576 (1981) established that an
"enterprise" under RICO is "a group of persons associated together for a
common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct" and is proved by
"evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by evidence
that the various associates function as a continuing unit." While this case

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
was abrogated by United States v. Lane, 474 U.S. 438 (1986), the abrogation
related to misjoinder issues under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 8(b)
and did not affect Turkette's core holding regarding the definition of a RICO
enterprise.
Lockheed Martin Corp. v. Boeing Co., 314 F.Supp.2d 1198 (M.D. Fla. 2004)
further clarified that a civil RICO conspiracy claim requires only that "the
defendant conspired to violate some substantive provision of RICO, that
some member of the conspiracy committed an overt act of racketeering, and
that the act of racketeering injured the plaintiff."
Analysis
The Wife and Stepfather's Conduct as a Pattern of
Racketeering Activity
The alleged conduct of the wife and stepfather—involving financial fraud,
concealment of funds, and preparation of false legal documents—may
constitute predicate acts under RICO if these actions qualify as racketeering
activities defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1961. In particular, if their actions included
mail fraud, wire fraud, or financial institution fraud, they could satisfy the
statutory definition of racketeering activity.
Applying the "continuity plus relationship" test from H.J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229 (1989), the wife and
stepfather's actions appear related as they share the same purpose
(defrauding the husband), involve the same participants (the wife and
stepfather), target the same victim (the husband), and employ similar
methods (financial manipulation and document falsification). As stated in 
Wisdom v. First Midwest Bank, of Poplar Bluff, 167 F.3d 402 (8th Cir. 1999),
the relationship prong is satisfied when predicate acts "have the same or
similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission."
For the continuity prong, the fact pattern suggests open-ended continuity
rather than closed-ended continuity. As explained in Crest Constr. II, Inc. v.
Doe, 660 F.3d 346 (8th Cir. 2011), "open-ended continuity involves acts
which, by their nature, threaten repetition into the future." The coordinated
nature of the wife and stepfather's scheme, involving multiple fraudulent
steps and interstate activities, suggests a sophisticated operation that was
designed to continue extracting financial resources from the husband.
Evidence of Threat of Continued Criminal Activity
Several aspects of the wife and stepfather's conduct support a finding of
open-ended continuity:
Multiple Steps in the Fraudulent Scheme: The fact that their
scheme involved multiple steps (financial fraud, concealment of funds,
preparation of false documents) indicates a level of complexity and
planning consistent with an ongoing operation rather than a one-time
event. As noted in Perlman v. Zell, 938 F.Supp. 1327 (N.D. Ill. 1996),
1. 

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
allegations that "portray the defendants as employing the modus
operandi of regular self-dealing... and the fraudulent manipulation of...
assets to cover their tracks and increase their personal gains" can
"suggest a credible threat of continuing future criminal activity."
Interstate Activities: The crossing of state lines to further the scheme
indicates a willingness to expand the scope of their activities
geographically, suggesting a more ambitious and potentially ongoing
criminal enterprise. This interstate element also directly implicates 18
U.S.C. § 1341, which criminalizes the use of "private or commercial
interstate carrier[s]" to execute fraudulent schemes.
Preparation of False Legal Documents: Creating fraudulent legal
documents demonstrates a level of sophistication and commitment to
the scheme that suggests future criminal activity. This aspect of their
conduct aligns with what Heinrich v. Waiting Angels Adoption Servs.,
Inc., 668 F.3d 393 (6th Cir. 2012) described as considering "the totality
of the circumstances surrounding the commission of those acts" to
determine if there is "a threat of continuing criminal activity beyond
the period during which the predicate acts were performed."
Ongoing Financial Benefit: If the scheme was designed to
continuously siphon assets from the husband over time (rather than a
one-time theft), this would strongly support open-ended continuity. As
explained in Menzies v. Seyfarth Shaw LLP, 943 F.3d 328 (7th Cir.
2019), open-ended continuity can be established "by showing that a
defendant's actions pose a specific threat of repetition" or "that the
predicate acts form part of the defendant's ongoing and regular way of
doing business."
The Wife and Stepfather as a RICO Enterprise
The coordinated actions of the wife and stepfather could constitute a RICO
enterprise under United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576 (1981), which
defined an enterprise as "a group of persons associated together for a
common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct." Their apparent
coordination in executing multiple fraudulent steps demonstrates an
"ongoing organization" where "associates function as a continuing unit."
Furthermore, the fact that they prepared legal documents and crossed state
lines suggests formalized planning and coordination, strengthening the
argument that they operated as an enterprise rather than merely as
individuals committing separate acts. While Turkette was abrogated by 
United States v. Lane, 474 U.S. 438 (1986), the abrogation concerned
procedural joinder issues and did not affect this substantive definition of a
RICO enterprise.
Under Lockheed Martin Corp. v. Boeing Co., 314 F.Supp.2d 1198 (M.D. Fla.
2004), a civil conspiracy claim under RICO requires showing that "the
defendant conspired to violate some substantive provision of RICO, that
some member of the conspiracy committed an overt act of racketeering, and
that the act of racketeering injured the plaintiff." The wife and stepfather's
2.

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
coordinated scheme, resulting in the husband's loss of property and financial
resources, appears to satisfy these elements.
Exceptions and Caveats
Requirement for Predicate Acts
For a successful RICO claim, the husband must establish that the wife and
stepfather's actions constitute specific predicate acts enumerated in 18
U.S.C. § 1961. Not all fraudulent activities qualify as racketeering activities
under RICO. According to Studco Bldg. Sys. U.S., LLC v. 1st Advantage Fed.
Credit Union, 509 F.Supp.3d 560 (E.D. Va. 2020), "'Racketeering activity'
includes mail and wire fraud." The husband would need to prove that the
wife and stepfather's actions involved specific statutory violations such as
mail fraud, wire fraud, or financial institution fraud.
Duration of Conduct
While open-ended continuity focuses on the threat of future criminal activity
rather than the duration of past conduct, courts may still consider the
timeframe over which the alleged predicate acts occurred. As noted in 
Handeen v. Lemaire, 112 F.3d 1339 (8th Cir. 1997), "Failure to shoulder this
burden [of proving closed-ended continuity] is not an insuperable bar to
relief, however, because even if the acts do not span the years necessary to
establish closed-ended continuity... the predicates will meet the definition of
open-ended continuity to the extent they 'involve a distinct threat of long-
term racketeering activity.'" If the wife and stepfather's scheme occurred
over a very brief period, additional evidence would be needed to
demonstrate that their actions posed a threat of continued criminal activity.
Cessation of Activities
If the wife and stepfather have ceased their fraudulent activities, this might
weaken but not necessarily defeat a claim of open-ended continuity. In 
"RICO: A Primer", it is noted that "a threat of 'continuing criminal activity
extending indefinitely into the future,'" can be established "in light of the
nature of the enterprise and predicate acts alleged." If the nature of their
enterprise inherently suggests ongoing criminal activity, cessation might not
defeat open-ended continuity. However, if their scheme was designed with a
clear endpoint (for example, to obtain specific assets and then stop), this
could undermine a finding of open-ended continuity.
Conclusion
The wife and stepfather's alleged ongoing scheme involving financial fraud,
concealment of funds, and preparation of false legal documents likely
satisfies the open-ended continuity requirement under RICO if these actions
constitute predicate acts of racketeering activity. Their coordinated efforts,
involving multiple steps and crossing state lines, suggests a sophisticated

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
operation that was designed to continue extracting financial resources from
the husband.
To establish a successful RICO claim based on open-ended continuity, the
husband would need to demonstrate that:
The wife and stepfather's actions constitute specific predicate acts of
racketeering activity under 18 U.S.C. § 1961, such as mail fraud, wire
fraud, or financial institution fraud.
These predicate acts are related, sharing similar purposes, methods,
participants, and targeting the same victim, as required by H.J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229 (1989).
The nature of their scheme poses a threat of continued criminal activity
into the future, as defined in Menzies v. Seyfarth Shaw LLP, 943 F.3d
328 (7th Cir. 2019) and other key cases.
The wife and stepfather operated as an enterprise under RICO, defined
in United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576 (1981) as "a group of persons
associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of
conduct."
The husband suffered injury to his business or property as a result of
the RICO violation, entitling him to civil remedies under 18 U.S.C. §
1964.
The preparation of false legal documents, the crossing of state lines, and the
apparently ongoing nature of the scheme all support the argument that the
wife and stepfather's activities were not isolated events but rather part of a
pattern of racketeering activity that threatened to continue into the future.
These factors strengthen the case for establishing open-ended continuity
under RICO, potentially entitling the husband to the significant civil
remedies provided by the statute, including treble damages and attorney's
fees.

The pattern element 'requires at least two acts of racketeering activity.' 18
U.S.C. § 1961(5); see also H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S.
229, 237-38, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989). However, a mere
allegation of two or more acts is insufficient to state a RICO claim; the
predicate acts must be related and must 'amount to or pose a threat of
continued criminal activity.' See United HealthCare Corp. v. American Trade

closed-ended or open-ended. Closed-ended continuity involves 'a series of
related predicates extending over a substantial period of time;' open-ended
continuity involves acts which, by their nature, threaten repetition into the
future. See H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241-42, 109 S.Ct. 2893.
Summary
To establish a RICO claim, there must be a pattern of racketeering activity,
which requires at least two related predicate acts that pose a threat of
continued criminal activity. The passage explains the concepts of relatedness
and continuity, which are essential to proving a pattern. The passage
supports the proposition by explaining that open-ended continuity involves
acts that threaten repetition into the future, which aligns with the argument
that the wife's and stepfather's conduct could pose a threat of continuing
criminal activity.

To satisfy the RICO continuity element, therefore, a plaintiff must provide
evidence of multiple predicate acts occurring over a substantial period of
time (closed-end continuity) or evidence that the alleged predicate acts
threaten to extend into the future (open-ended continuity).” Craig Outdoor,
528 F.3d at 1028. “Closed-ended continuity involves ‘a series of related
predicates extending over a substantial period of time;’ open-ended
continuity involves acts which, by their nature, threaten repetition into the
future.” Wisdom, 167 F.3d at 407 (quoting H.J., Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492
U.S. 229, 241–42, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989)).

Extract
The plaintiffs can, however, establish open-ended continuity. 'Often a RICO
action will be brought before continuity can be established [by showing
predicate acts spanning a substantial period of time]. In such cases, liability
depends on whether the threat of continuity is demonstrated.' H.J. Inc., 492
U.S. at 242, 109 S.Ct. 2893. So the plaintiffs must plausibly allege that there
was a threat of continuing criminal activity beyond the period during which
the predicate acts were performed. Determining whether the predicate acts
establish open-ended continuity requires a court to examine the specific
facts of the case. Id. The threat of continuing racketeering activity need not
be established, however, exclusively by reference to the predicate acts
alone; rather, a court should consider the totality of the circumstances
surrounding the commission of those acts. Brown, 546 F.3d at 355.
Summary
The passage explains that open-ended continuity under RICO can be
established by demonstrating a threat of continuing criminal activity. This is
relevant to the proposition because it suggests that the wife's and
stepfather's actions, if part of a broader pattern of fraudulent conduct, could
be seen as posing such a threat. The passage also emphasizes that the
totality of the circumstances should be considered, which aligns with the
proposition's argument that the repeated fraudulent acts and concealment
indicate an ongoing scheme. The preparation of false legal documents and
crossing state lines could further support the claim of open-ended continuity.

Extract
Continuity as an open-ended concept refers 'to past conduct that by its
nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.' H.J., Inc., 492 U.S.
at 241, 109 S.Ct. at 2901. When 'a RICO action [is] brought before [closed-
ended] continuity can be established,' 'liability depends on whether the
threat of continuity is demonstrated.' Id. at 242, 109 S.Ct. at 2902. Thus,
although a RICO plaintiff must show duration to allege closed-ended
continuity, open-ended continuity may satisfy the continuity prong of the
pattern requirement regardless of its brevity.
Summary
The passage explains the concept of open-ended continuity under RICO,
which is relevant to the proposition. It states that open-ended continuity
involves past conduct that projects into the future with a threat of repetition.
This aligns with the proposition that the wife's and stepfather's actions could
be part of an ongoing scheme with a threat of continued fraudulent activity.

The passage also clarifies that open-ended continuity can be established
even if the conduct is brief, as long as there is a demonstrated threat of
continuity.

Extract
For open-ended continuity, 'the threat of continuity may be established by
showing that the predicate acts or offenses are part of an ongoing entity's
regular way of doing business. Thus, the threat of continuity is sufficiently
established where the predicates can be attributed to a defendant operating
as part of a long-term association that exists for criminal purposes.'

Summary
Open-ended continuity under RICO can be established if the predicate acts
are part of an ongoing entity's regular way of doing business or if they are
part of a long-term association for criminal purposes. This supports the
proposition that the wife's and stepfather's actions could be seen as part of
an ongoing scheme to defraud, especially if their conduct is part of a
broader pattern of similar fraudulent activities.

U.S. District Court — Northern District of Illinois
Extract
The second requirement to show a pattern of racketeering activity is the
continuation of the criminal activity over time, either in the past (closed-
ended continuity) or through the threat of future criminal activity (open-
ended continuity). See H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241, 109 S.Ct. at 2901-02. The
complaint here is replete with allegations of continuous activity. In the
securities fraud claim, the issuance of additional Participation Units at
regular intervals over a seven-year period, and the repeated issuance of
Annual Statements listing allegedly false statements of the Units' value,
demonstrates closed-ended continuity. Other allegations portray the
defendants as employing the modus operandi of regular self-dealing to the
detriment of outside investors, and the fraudulent manipulation of
partnerships' assets to cover their tracks and increase their personal gains.
If true, this picture would suggest a credible threat of continuing future
criminal activity. Id. at 242, 109 S.Ct. at 2902 (open-ended continuity may be

Summary
The court in Perlman v. Zell recognized the concept of open-ended continuity
under RICO, where the predicate acts are part of an ongoing entity's regular
way of doing business. The passage discusses how repeated fraudulent acts
and the manipulation of assets to cover tracks and increase personal gains
can suggest a credible threat of continuing future criminal activity. This
aligns with the proposition that the wife's and stepfather's conduct,
involving repeated fraudulent acts and concealment, could pose a threat of
continuing criminal activity.

To plead a pattern of racketeering activity, 'a plaintiff must demonstrate a
relationship between the predicate acts as well as a threat of continuing
activity'—a standard known as the 'continuity plus relationship' test. ... The
alternative continuity inquiry—applicable to an 'open-ended' series of
misconduct—focuses not on what acts occurred in the past but on whether a
concrete threat remains for the conduct to continue moving forward. ... This
can be done by showing that a defendant’s actions pose a specific threat of
repetition; that the predicate acts form part of the defendant’s ongoing and
regular way of doing business; or that the defendant operates a long-term
association for criminal purposes.
Summary
The "continuity plus relationship" test is crucial for establishing a pattern of
racketeering activity under RICO. The passage explains that open-ended
continuity can be demonstrated by showing a threat of repetition or that the
predicate acts are part of the defendant's regular business practices. This
aligns with the proposition that the wife's and stepfather's actions could be
part of an ongoing scheme, posing a threat of continued criminal activity.

Moreover, even if we were not to have found that conduct lasting three and

conclude that continuity still would have been established for the purposes
of summary judgment in the present case under an 'open-ended' continuity
analysis. Under H.J. Inc., if a RICO action is brought before a plaintiff can
establish long-term criminal conduct, the 'continuity' prong may still be met
if a plaintiff can prove a threat of continued racketeering activity. Whether
the predicate acts constitute a threat of continued racketeering activity
depends on 'the specific facts of each case,' id. at 242, 109 S.Ct. at 2902, but
H.J. Inc. suggests that open-ended continuity may be satisfied 'where it is
shown that the predicates are a regular way of conducting defendant's
ongoing legitimate business ... or of conducting or participating in an
ongoing and legitimate RICO 'enterprise.'
Summary
The concept of open-ended continuity under RICO can be established if the
predicate acts pose a threat of continued racketeering activity. This can be
shown if the acts are a regular way of conducting the defendant's business
or if they are part of an ongoing RICO enterprise. The passage supports the
proposition by illustrating that repeated fraudulent acts and concealment, as
part of a scheme, could indicate a threat of ongoing criminal activity, thus
satisfying the open-ended continuity requirement.
Reynolds v. Condon, 908 F.Supp. 1494 (N.D. W.Va. 1996)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of West Virginia
Extract
Continuity requires proof of 'related predicates extending over a substantial
period of time' or 'involving a specific threat of repetition extending
indefinitely into the future.' H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 242, 109 S.Ct. at 2902
(proof that predicate acts are 'part of an ongoing entity's regular way of
doing business' may suffice to meet 'continuity' requirement).
Summary
The passage from "Reynolds v. Condon" discusses the concept of continuity
under the RICO statute, which is crucial for establishing a pattern of
racketeering activity. It highlights that continuity can be demonstrated by
showing related predicate acts over a substantial period or a threat of
repetition into the future. This aligns with the proposition that the wife's and
stepfather's actions were part of an ongoing scheme, as their repeated
fraudulent acts and concealment could be seen as posing a threat of
continuing criminal activity. The passage supports the idea that if the
fraudulent acts are part of the entity's regular way of doing business, it
suffices to meet the continuity requirement.

United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246
(1981)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
In order to secure a conviction under RICO, the Government must prove
both the existence of an 'enterprise' and the connected 'pattern of
racketeering activity.' The enterprise is an entity, for present purposes a
group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a
course of conduct. The pattern of racketeering activity is, on the other hand,
a series of criminal acts as defined by the statute. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) (1976
ed., Supp. III). The former is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization,
formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a
continuing unit.
Summary
RICO applies to both legitimate and illegitimate enterprises, and it requires
proof of an enterprise and a pattern of racketeering activity. The passage
supports the proposition by explaining that an enterprise can be a group of
individuals associated for a common purpose, and a pattern of racketeering
activity involves a series of criminal acts. This aligns with the proposition
that the wife's and stepfather's actions were part of an ongoing scheme, as it
suggests that their conduct could constitute an enterprise engaged in a
pattern of racketeering activity.
Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893,
106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
RICO's legislative history, however, establishes that Congress intended that
to prove a 'pattern of racketeering activity' a plaintiff or prosecutor must
show both 'relationship' and 'continuity'—that the racketeering predicates
are related, and that they either constitute or threaten long-term criminal
activity. ... Continuity of racketeering activity likewise may be demonstrated
in a variety of ways. Continuity is centrally a temporal concept, and may be
either closed- or open-ended. A party alleging a RICO violation may
demonstrate continuity over a closed period by proving a series of related
predicates extending over a substantial period of time. Otherwise, it must be
shown that the predicates establish a threat of long-term racketeering
activity—for example, because the predicates themselves involve a distinct
threat of such activity; because they are part of the regular way of doing
business for an ongoing entity such as a criminal association or legitimate
business; or because they are a regular means of conducting or participating
in an ongoing RICO enterprise.

Summary
To establish a RICO violation, there must be both a relationship and
continuity in the racketeering activities. The passage explains that
continuity can be demonstrated by showing a threat of long-term criminal
activity, which aligns with the proposition that the wife's and stepfather's
actions could be part of an ongoing scheme. The passage supports the idea
that repeated fraudulent acts and concealment could indicate a threat of
continuing criminal activity, which is essential for establishing open-ended
continuity under RICO.
Sedima v. Imrex Company, Inc, 473 U.S. 479, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346
(1985)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
RICO takes aim at 'racketeering activity,' which it defines as any act
'chargeable' under several generically described state criminal laws, any act
'indictable' under numerous specific federal criminal provisions, including
mail and wire fraud... The 'pattern' element of the statute was designed to
limit its application to planned, ongoing, continuing crime as opposed to
sporadic, unrelated, isolated criminal episodes. The 'enterprise' element,
when coupled with the 'pattern' requirement, was intended by the Congress
to keep the reach of RICO focused directly on traditional organized crime
and comparable ongoing criminal activities carried out in a structured,
organized environment.
Summary
The passage from the Sedima v. Imrex Company, Inc case explains that RICO
targets ongoing and continuous criminal activities rather than isolated
incidents. The requirement of a "pattern" of racketeering activity implies
that the acts must be related and pose a threat of continued criminal
conduct. This aligns with the proposition that the wife's and stepfather's
actions were part of an ongoing scheme, as RICO's focus is on preventing
continuous and organized criminal activities.

participate...in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). 'Racketeering activity' includes
any of several listed crimes 'which is chargeable under State law and
punishable by imprisonment for more than one year,' as well as any act
chargeable under one of several enumerated federal statutes. § 1961(1). A
'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering
activity, which must be 'related' and 'amount to or pose a threat of continued
criminal activity.'
Summary
To establish a RICO claim, there must be a pattern of racketeering activity,
which involves at least two related acts that pose a threat of continued
criminal activity. This aligns with the proposition that the wife's and
stepfather's actions could be part of an ongoing scheme, as their conduct
involves repeated fraudulent acts and concealment, potentially posing a
threat of continued criminal activity.
WATER INTERN. NETWORK, USA, INC. v. East, 892 F. Supp. 1477 (M.D.
Fla. 1995)
U.S. District Court — Middle District of Florida
Extract
A claim of civil RICO under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) necessarily alleges a
violation of section 1962... The first part of the two-pronged analysis in
establishing a pattern of racketeering activity is the notion of related acts...
The criminal acts must have the same or similar purposes, results,
participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise be
interrelated by distinguishing characteristics which are not isolated events...
The second prong in satisfying a pattern of racketeering activity is the
continuity requirement... Continuity encompasses both a close-ended and
open-ended concept. A party alleging a RICO violation may demonstrate
continuity over a closed period by proving a series of related predicate acts
over a substantial period of time. Otherwise, it must be shown that the
predicate acts establish a threat of long-term racketeering activity.
Summary
To establish a RICO claim, one must demonstrate a pattern of racketeering
activity, which involves related acts and continuity. The passage explains
that related acts must have common purposes or methods and not be
isolated events. It also describes continuity as either close-ended (a series of
acts over time) or open-ended (a threat of ongoing criminal activity). This
aligns with the proposition that the wife's and stepfather's actions were part
of an ongoing scheme, as their repeated fraudulent acts and concealment
could be seen as posing a threat of continuing criminal activity.

Lockhart v. Deluca
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Michigan
Extract
To state a RICO claim, a plaintiff must plead: “(1) conduct (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.” Sedima,
S.P.R.L., 473 U.S. at 496. The Sixth Circuit has instructed that RICO
pleadings must be liberally construed, Begala v. PNC Bank, 214 F.3d 776,
781 (6th Cir. 2000), but plaintiffs nonetheless must offer allegations
establishing each element.
Summary
To support a RICO claim, a plaintiff must establish conduct of an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity. The passage emphasizes the need
for a pattern, which aligns with the proposition that the wife's and
stepfather's actions were part of an ongoing scheme. The liberal
construction of RICO pleadings suggests that the courts may be open to
considering a broader interpretation of what constitutes a pattern of
racketeering activity, which could include the repeated fraudulent acts and
concealment described in the proposition.
Corporacion Insular de Seguros v. Reyes Munoz, 849 F.Supp. 126 (D. P.R.
1994)
U.S. District Court — District of Puerto Rico
Extract
The issuing and processing of the checks constitute a violation of the civil
RICO statute. In order to prove a violation of civil RICO, plaintiff must prove:
(1) that there existed an enterprise, which affected interstate commerce; (2)
that codefendants were employed by or associated with the enterprise; (3)
that codefendants participated in the conduct of the enterprise's affairs; and
(4) that codefendants' participation was through a pattern of racketeering
activity... Codefendants' participation in the enterprise constituted a pattern
of racketeering. The 'pattern of racketeering activity' consists of a requisite
number of criminal acts performed by the persons composing the
enterprise... In addition, the racketeering predicates must be related and
amount to or pose a continued threat of criminal activity.
Summary
The passage outlines the elements necessary to establish a civil RICO
violation, including the existence of an enterprise, participation in the
enterprise's affairs, and a pattern of racketeering activity. The passage also
emphasizes that the racketeering predicates must be related and pose a

continued threat of criminal activity, which aligns with the proposition's
assertion of open-ended continuity under RICO.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Ninth Circuit
Extract
In Sun Savings, we held that 'it is not necessary to show more than one
fraudulent scheme or criminal episode to establish a pattern under Sedima.'
825 F.2d at 193. Rather, plaintiffs need only allege predicate acts which are
not 'isolated or sporadic.' Id. at 193-94. The test is 'whether the acts posed a
threat of continuing activity.' Id. at 194. In California Architectural Bldg.
Prods. v. Franciscan Ceramics, Inc., 818 F.2d 1466 (9th Cir.1987), we
recognized that RICO's continuity requirement is not satisfied if plaintiffs
have merely alleged 'a single fraud perpetrated on a single victim.' 818 F.2d
at 1469 (citing Schreiber, 806 F.2d at 1399). Nevertheless, we held that a
plaintiff properly pleads a RICO pattern where it alleges multiple predicate
acts against multiple victims over a significant period of time (five months)
since that clearly satisfies RICO's requirement of 'two or more acts of
racketeering activity.'
Summary
The Ninth Circuit does not require multiple fraudulent schemes to establish
a RICO pattern. Instead, it is sufficient to show that the predicate acts are
not isolated or sporadic and that they pose a threat of continuing activity.
This aligns with the proposition that the wife's and stepfather's actions, if
part of an ongoing scheme, could satisfy the RICO continuity requirement by
demonstrating a threat of ongoing criminal activity.

The Supreme Court has explained that a civil RICO claim has four essential
elements: '(1) conduct; (2) of an enterprise; (3) through a pattern; (4) of
racketeering activity.' Whitney, Bradley & Brown, Inc. v. Kammermann, 436

Summary
A civil RICO claim requires demonstrating a pattern of racketeering activity,
which includes acts like mail and wire fraud. The passage emphasizes the
need for related predicate acts that pose a threat of continued criminal
activity, aligning with the proposition's assertion of an ongoing fraudulent
scheme. The "continuity plus relationship" test supports the idea that
repeated fraudulent acts and concealment could indicate a threat of ongoing
criminal activity, which is central to the proposition.

Continuity, however, is a more elusive concept. In H.J., Inc., the court
described continuity as 'both a closed- and open-ended concept, referring
either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its
nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.' 492 U.S. at 241,
109 S.Ct. at 2902. Continuity exists where the predicate acts constitute or
threaten continued criminal activity. Id. at 240, 109 S.Ct. at 2901. The court
listed several examples of what would establish a threat of continued
racketeering: (1) the predicate acts inherently involve a distinct threat of
long-term criminal activity; (2) the entity exists for the purpose of engaging
in criminal activity; or (3) the predicate acts are a regular way of conducting
an ongoing legitimate business. Id. at 242-43, 109 S.Ct. at 2902-03.
Summary
Continuity under RICO can be established by showing that predicate acts
either constitute or threaten continued criminal activity. The passage
provides examples of how continuity can be demonstrated, such as when
predicate acts involve a threat of long-term criminal activity or are a regular
way of conducting business. This aligns with the proposition that the wife's
and stepfather's actions could be part of an ongoing scheme, posing a threat
of continued criminal activity.

Extract
Criminal acts are sufficiently related to be considered part of the same
enterprise if they had the same or similar purposes, results, participants,
victims or methods of commission, or if they were otherwise 'interrelated by
distinguishing characteristics' as opposed to being 'isolated events.' ... We
are satisfied here that the DTF and CSEU schemes were sufficiently related
so that they could be considered parts of the same enterprise on the issue of
closed ended continuity. They shared a common central participant (Hively),
a common victim (Arkansas), a common purpose and results (Hively's
enrichment), and common methods of commission (abuse of Hively's power
as prosecuting attorney).
Summary
The court in "U.S. v. Hively" considered criminal acts to be part of the same
enterprise if they shared common purposes, participants, victims, or
methods, or were otherwise interrelated. This supports the proposition that
the wife's and stepfather's actions could be seen as part of an ongoing
scheme if they share these characteristics. The passage also discusses the
concept of continuity, which is relevant to establishing a pattern of
racketeering activity under RICO.

In order to prevail on its RICO claim, ePlus was required to prove that
Aboud had engaged in a 'pattern of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1962;
H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 232-33, 109 S.Ct. 2893,
106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989). Under RICO, 'racketeering activity' is defined as
'any act or threat' involving specified state law crimes, such as murder or
bribery, or an 'act' indictable under various federal statutes, such as mail
and wire fraud. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). To have a 'pattern' of such activity, two
or more predicate acts of racketeering must have been committed within a
ten year period. Id. § 1961(5). ... To establish such a pattern, 'a plaintiff ...
must show that the racketeering predicates are related, and that they
amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.' H.J. Inc., 492 U.S.
at 239, 109 S.Ct. 2893 (first and third emphasis added). In essence, the
pattern requirement has been reduced to a 'continuity plus relationship'
test. Id. ... The continuity aspect, in turn, refers 'either to a closed period of
repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition.' Id. at 241, 109 S.Ct. 2893.
Summary
To establish a RICO claim, there must be a pattern of racketeering activity,
which involves related predicate acts that pose a threat of continued
criminal activity. The passage explains the "continuity plus relationship" test,
which is crucial for determining whether the actions in question constitute a
pattern under RICO. This directly supports the proposition that the wife's
and stepfather's actions could be part of an ongoing scheme, as it highlights
the need for related acts that threaten future criminal conduct.

the Court has referred to it as 'both a closed- and open-ended concept,' id. at
241, 109 S.Ct. at 2902, which is principally temporal in nature. 'A party
alleging a RICO violation may demonstrate continuity over a closed period
by proving a series of related predicates extending over a substantial period
of time.' Id. at 242, 109 S.Ct. at 2902. Failure to shoulder this burden is not
an insuperable bar to relief, however, because even if the acts do not span
the years necessary to establish closed-ended continuity, see Primary Care
Investors, Seven, Inc. v. PHP Healthcare Corp., 986 F.2d 1208, 1215 (8th Cir.
1993)('Other Circuits have consistently held that the requirement of
continuity over a closed period is not met when the predicate acts extend
less than a year.'), the predicates will meet the definition of open-ended
continuity to the extent they 'involve a distinct threat of long-term
racketeering activity,' H.J., 492 U.S. at 242, 109 S.Ct. at 2902 (emphasis
added).
Summary
Concept of "continuity plus relationship" in the context of RICO violations,
emphasizing that predicate acts must be related and continuous. It explains
that continuity can be either closed-ended or open-ended, with open-ended
continuity involving a threat of long-term racketeering activity. This aligns
with the proposition that the wife's and stepfather's actions could be part of
an ongoing scheme, as their repeated fraudulent acts and concealment
could pose a threat of continuing criminal activity.

existence of an 'agreement' to participate in a RICO conspiracy may be
proved by 'showing (1) the existence of an agreement on an overall
objective, or (2) in the absence of an agreement[] on an overall objective
that the defendant agreed personally to commit two or more predicate acts.'

Summary
The existence of a RICO enterprise can be established by demonstrating an
ongoing organization where associates function as a continuing unit. This
supports the proposition that the wife's and stepfather's actions were part of
an ongoing scheme. Additionally, the requirements for a civil conspiracy
claim under RICO, including the need for an agreement to commit predicate
acts, align with the proposition's assertion of a fraudulent scheme involving
multiple steps and repeated acts.

Summary
The passage outlines the unlawful nature of engaging in a pattern of
racketeering activity to acquire or maintain control over an enterprise
affecting interstate commerce. This supports the proposition by highlighting
that the wife's and stepfather's actions, if part of a pattern of racketeering,
could be considered unlawful under RICO. The passage's reference to
activities affecting interstate commerce aligns with the proposition's
mention of crossing state lines to further the scheme, indicating a broader

of mail or interstate carriers to execute a fraudulent scheme is a federal
offense. This aligns with the proposition's mention of crossing state lines to
further the scheme, indicating an intent to continue fraudulent activity. The
statute's broad language about schemes to defraud supports the idea of
ongoing fraudulent conduct, which is relevant to establishing open-ended

the proposition because it provides a legal basis for prosecuting fraudulent
schemes that involve interstate communications, which could include the
wife's and stepfather's actions if they used such means to further their
scheme. The passage supports the idea that such actions are part of a

continuity under RICO.
18 U.S.C. § 1961 18 U.S.C. § 1961 Definitions
Extract
As used in this chapter- 'racketeering activity' means... (B) any act which is
indictable under any of the following provisions of title 18, United States
Code: ... section 1341 (relating to mail fraud), section 1343 (relating to wire
fraud), section 1344 (relating to financial institution fraud)... 'pattern of
racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, one
of which occurred after the effective date of this chapter and the last of
which occurred within ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment)
after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity;
Summary
The definition of "racketeering activity" includes acts such as mail fraud,
wire fraud, and financial institution fraud, which are relevant to the
proposition's claim of fraudulent activities. Additionally, the definition of a
"pattern of racketeering activity" requires at least two acts, supporting the
idea of ongoing or repeated criminal conduct. This aligns with the
proposition's assertion of an ongoing scheme involving multiple fraudulent
acts.

The 'continuity' component is met by either closed-ended continuity, defined
as 'a series of related predicates extending over a substantial period of
time,' or open-ended continuity, defined as conduct that poses a threat of
extending into the future. The Court suggested a case-by-case examination
of this issue, noting that the existence of a 'threat of continued racketeering
activity' is a function of particular facts. The Court offered a non-exhaustive
list of situations that may constitute a pattern, and stated 'development of
these concepts must await future cases.'
Summary
The concept of continuity under RICO can be satisfied by demonstrating
either closed-ended or open-ended continuity. Open-ended continuity is
particularly relevant to the proposition as it involves conduct that poses a
threat of continuing into the future. The passage emphasizes the need for a
case-by-case examination to determine the existence of a threat of continued
racketeering activity, which aligns with the proposition's argument that the
wife's and stepfather's conduct could pose such a threat.

Open-ended continuity, in contrast, requires proof of 'a threat of continued
racketeering activity.' Id. at 242. Under H.J. Inc., open-ended continuity may
be established in various ways. The Court furnished some examples. First, a
small number of related predicates occurring close together in time will
establish open-ended continuity if 'the racketeering acts themselves include
a specific threat of repetition extending indefinitely into the future, and thus
supply the requisite threat of continuity.' Second, the threat of continuity
may be established with a 'showing that the predicate acts or offenses are

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
part of an ongoing entity’s regular way of doing business.' Third, continuity
is proved 'if the predicates can be attributed to a defendant operating as
part of a long‑term association that exists for criminal purposes.'
Summary
Open-ended continuity under RICO can be established by demonstrating a
threat of continued racketeering activity. This can be shown through a
specific threat of repetition, the predicate acts being part of an entity's
regular business, or the acts being part of a long-term criminal association.
These criteria align with the proposition that the wife's and stepfather's
actions were part of an ongoing fraudulent scheme, suggesting a threat of
continued criminal activity.

idea that repeated fraudulent acts and concealment, as part of a broader
pattern, could satisfy the open-ended continuity requirement under RICO.

The Supreme Court made a second attempt to clarify the 'pattern' concept in
H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. In that case, the Court held
that when proving a 'pattern of racketeering activity,' RICO requires both
relationship and continuity of predicate acts as separate elements. However,
the Court recognized that proof of these factors will often overlap. The
relationship prong is defined by the connection of the defendant's criminal
acts to one another: 'continuity' is successfully proved if a prosecutor can
show actual continuity during a past, closed period of repeated conduct or
an open-ended threat of continued racketeering activity in the future. The
H.J., Inc. Court suggested a case-by-case examination of this issue.
Summary
The Supreme Court's interpretation of the "pattern" requirement under
RICO involves both the relationship and continuity of predicate acts. The
passage explains that continuity can be shown through either a past period
of repeated conduct or an open-ended threat of continued criminal activity.
This supports the proposition that the wife's and stepfather's actions could
be part of an ongoing scheme, as their conduct involves repeated fraudulent
acts and concealment, which could pose a threat of continuing criminal
activity.

The Supreme Court made a second attempt to clarify the 'pattern' concept in
H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. The Court held that when
proving a 'pattern of racketeering activity,' RICO requires both (a)
relationship and (b) continuity of predicate acts as separate elements. This
test is referred to as the 'continuity plus relationship' test. The Court
recognized, however, that evidence in proof of these factors can often
overlap. The relationship prong is defined by the connection of the
defendant's criminal acts to one another. The 'continuity' prong is
successfully proven if a prosecutor can show actual continuity during a past
closed period of repeated conduct or an open-ended threat of... or sporadic
criminal acts the court refused to place the continuity prong in direct
tension with the relationship element, and concluded that the proper test is
whether the acts of the defendant pose a 'threat' of continuing activity.
Summary
The Supreme Court's interpretation of RICO's "pattern" requirement
involves both a relationship and continuity of predicate acts. The continuity

commission of two predicate acts, the government must show that the
predicate acts are related and amount to or pose a threat of continued
criminal activity."; "Establishing the minimum number of predicates ... is not
sufficient to establish a pattern; the racketeering predicates must be related
and amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity"; "suggesting
open ended continuity could be satisfied by showing likelihood of predicate
acts continuing into future or that predicate acts occur in normal course of

racketeering activity is continuous.
Summary
The passages discuss the requirements for establishing a pattern of
racketeering activity under RICO, emphasizing the need for related
predicate acts that pose a threat of continued criminal activity. The concept
of open-ended continuity is highlighted, where the likelihood of predicate
acts continuing into the future or occurring as part of an entity's regular
business can satisfy the continuity requirement. This aligns with the
proposition that the wife's and stepfather's actions, if part of a broader
scheme, could be seen as posing a threat of ongoing criminal activity.

Vol. 4 No. 3 Pg. 7 Rico and the Prime: Taking a Bite Out of Crime?
Utah Bar Journal - Utah State Bar - 1991-00-00
Extract
In H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. the Court addressed the
standard for a RICO pattern. The Court rejected a 'separate schemes' test in
favor of a 'separate acts' test, so that two or more predicate acts within a
single scheme could support a RICO complaint. In endorsing the single
scheme, separate acts standard, the Court stated that 'to prove a pattern of
racketeering activity a plaintiff or prosecutor must show that the
racketeering predicates are related, and that they amount to or pose a
threat of continued criminal activity.'
Summary
The Supreme Court's interpretation of the RICO statute allows for a pattern
of racketeering activity to be established through related predicate acts that
pose a threat of continued criminal activity. This supports the proposition
that the wife's and stepfather's actions, if they involve repeated fraudulent
acts and concealment, could be seen as part of a pattern of racketeering
activity under RICO.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity.
The practitioner through their pleadings must articulate with great care and
attention a viable racketeering claim. In addition, § 1962(a), (b), and (c) are
limited in scope to conduct involving enterprises engaged in or the activities
of which affect interstate commerce. It is the activities of the enterprise, not
each predicate act, that must affect interstate or foreign commerce. RICO
requires no more than a slight effect upon interstate commerce.

highlights that the activities of the enterprise must affect interstate
commerce, even if only slightly. This supports the proposition by providing a

constitute a pattern of racketeering activity, potentially affecting interstate
commerce, and thus could be part of an ongoing fraudulent scheme.

was intended to involve, two or more predicate acts of racketeering.
Summary
Elements required to establish a RICO conspiracy, which includes an
agreement to join a racketeering scheme, knowing engagement in the

RECONCEIVING COERCION-BASED CRIMINAL DEFENSES.

School of Law - Galoob, Stephen R. - 2022-03-22
Extract
The inquiry here is meant to invoke the 'pattern of racketeering activity'
element of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
The Organized Crime Control Act (1970), which includes RICO, provides that
'criminal conduct forms a pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events.' The Supreme Court characterized this
requirement as a 'relationship' element and held that the statute further
requires a 'continuity' element, 'referring either to a closed period of
repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition.'

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The RICO statute requires both a "relationship" and a "continuity" element
to establish a pattern of racketeering activity. The passage explains that
criminal acts must be interrelated and not isolated, and there must be a
threat of continuing criminal activity. This directly supports the proposition
that the wife's and stepfather's actions could be part of an ongoing scheme,
as their conduct involves repeated fraudulent acts and concealment, which
could pose a threat of continuing criminal activity.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
The racketeering acts need not be similar or directly related to each other;
rather, it is sufficient that the racketeering acts are related in some way to
the affairs of the charged enterprise... The continuity requirement is
likewise satisfied where the predicates are a regular way of conducting the
defendant's ongoing legitimate business... A plaintiff may demonstrate a
pattern by establishment that the predicate acts pose a threat of continued
criminal activity, which is generally demonstrated by showing either: ...
Open-ended continuity. A threat of 'continuing criminal activity extending
indefinitely into the future,' in light of the nature of the enterprise and
predicate acts alleged.
Summary
The passage explains the requirements for establishing a pattern of
racketeering activity under RICO, specifically focusing on the concepts of
relatedness and continuity. It highlights that the acts need not be similar but
must be related to the enterprise's affairs. It also explains that continuity
can be shown through open-ended continuity, where there is a threat of
ongoing criminal activity. This directly supports the proposition that the
wife's and stepfather's actions could be part of an ongoing scheme, as their
repeated fraudulent acts and concealment could pose a threat of continuing
criminal activity.
