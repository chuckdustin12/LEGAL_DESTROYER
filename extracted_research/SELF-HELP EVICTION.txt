Question
how is self-help eviction detremental to the children's best interests when
there's no evidence of any danger to the children
Answer (Texas)
Short response
Self-help eviction is detrimental to the best interests of children even
without evidence of direct danger because it disrupts their stability, housing,
and emotional security, all of which are central to statutory and judicial
definitions of their welfare. Texas law and case authority emphasize that
instability and uncertainty alone can endanger a child’s well-being, making
self-help eviction contrary to the child’s best interests.
Summary
Texas statutes and case law make clear that a child’s best interests are not
limited to protection from immediate physical harm, but also encompass the
need for stability, continuity of care, and a safe, secure home environment.
Self-help eviction—where a parent or landlord unilaterally removes a child
and their caregiver from their home without judicial process—undermines
these interests by creating instability, uncertainty, and potential emotional
harm, even if there is no evidence of direct physical danger to the child.
The legislative framework, particularly the Texas Family Code, prioritizes a
child’s need for a stable, nonviolent, and continuous relationship with
capable parents, and prohibits actions that create housing instability or
expose children to abrupt changes in their living situation. Case law further
supports the view that conduct resulting in uncertainty and instability can
itself constitute endangerment, regardless of whether actual harm or danger
is proven. Therefore, self-help eviction is inherently detrimental to the best
interests of children under Texas law.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
The Texas Family Code sets out the public policy and statutory factors
governing the best interests of children. Section 153.001 of the Texas Family
Code establishes that the state’s policy is to ensure children have frequent
and continuing contact with parents who act in their best interests, to
provide a safe, stable, and nonviolent environment, and to encourage shared
parental rights and duties. This provision underscores that stability and
continuity are fundamental to a child’s welfare, and that actions
undermining these values are contrary to the child’s best interests (Tex.
Fam. Code § 153.001).

Section 263.307 of the Texas Family Code further elaborates on the best-
interest standard, presuming that prompt and permanent placement in a
safe environment is in the child’s best interest. The statute directs courts to
consider whether parents can provide a safe physical home, appropriate
supervision, and protection from instability or violence, even if not directed
at the child. The ability and willingness of the family to effect positive
environmental changes and cooperate with appropriate supervision are also
relevant (Tex. Fam. Code § 263.307).
Section 261.001 of the Texas Family Code defines “neglect” to include acts
or omissions that result in harm or create an immediate danger to a child’s
physical health or safety, including the failure to provide necessary shelter.
Notably, the statute does not require proof of actual injury; the risk of
immediate danger or the creation of an unstable environment can suffice to
constitute neglect (Tex. Fam. Code § 261.001).
While not directly a child welfare statute, Section 92.0081 of the Texas
Property Code prohibits landlords from excluding residential tenants
without judicial process, except in narrow circumstances. The statute’s
purpose is to protect tenants’ possessory rights and ensure continuity of
occupancy, which in turn supports housing stability for children. Unlawful
self-help eviction disrupts this stability and can have negative consequences
for children’s welfare, even if not directly addressed in the statute (Tex.
Prop. Code § 92.0081).
Case Law
Texas appellate courts have consistently held that a child’s best interests are
not limited to protection from immediate physical harm. In In re S.C.M.,
01-22-00964-CV (Tex. App. Jun 08, 2023), the court explained that
endangerment can be inferred from parental conduct that creates instability
and uncertainty, even if there is no evidence of actual harm or intent to
harm. The court cited the Texas Supreme Court’s decision in Holley v.
Adams, which identified the stability of the home and the child’s current and
future needs as central to the best-interest analysis. Thus, conduct that
subjects a child to a life of uncertainty and instability is itself considered
detrimental to the child’s well-being.
In contrast, In re E.F., 591 S.W.3d 138 (Tex. App. 2019) addressed a situation
where a parent received a notice to vacate but was being rehoused before
the deadline, and there was no evidence of actual neglect, abuse, or
endangerment. The court found that, absent evidence of concrete risk or
inability to meet the child’s needs, housing issues alone did not establish
detriment to the child’s best interests. This case highlights the importance
of context and the need for evidence of actual or imminent instability or
harm.

Analysis
The Detriment of Self-Help Eviction to Children’s Best Interests
The legislative and judicial authorities provided make clear that the best
interests of children are not solely defined by the absence of immediate
physical danger. Instead, Texas law recognizes that stability, continuity, and
a secure home environment are essential components of a child’s welfare.
Self-help eviction—where a parent or landlord unilaterally removes a child
and their caregiver from their home without judicial process—directly
undermines these interests in several ways.
First, self-help eviction disrupts the child’s housing stability, which is a core
element of the best-interest standard. Section 153.001 of the Texas Family
Code explicitly prioritizes a stable and nonviolent environment for children,
and Section 263.307 presumes that prompt and permanent placement in a
safe environment is in the child’s best interest. By forcibly removing a child
from their home without legal process, self-help eviction creates uncertainty,
disrupts routines, and may result in homelessness or temporary housing, all
of which are detrimental to the child’s emotional and psychological well-
being (Tex. Fam. Code § 153.001; Tex. Fam. Code § 263.307).
Second, the statutory definition of neglect in Section 261.001 includes not
only actual harm but also the creation of an immediate danger to a child’s
physical health or safety, including the failure to provide necessary shelter.
Even if there is no evidence of direct physical danger, the act of evicting a
child and their caregiver without judicial oversight can expose the child to
immediate risk of homelessness, lack of access to basic necessities, and
emotional distress. The law does not require proof of actual injury; the risk
and instability created by self-help eviction are sufficient to constitute
neglect and to weigh against the child’s best interests (Tex. Fam. Code §
261.001).
Third, the Texas Property Code’s prohibition on self-help eviction reflects a
broader public policy against actions that destabilize housing for families
and children. While the statute is primarily concerned with tenant rights, its
underlying rationale is to prevent the very instability and hardship that can
result from unlawful exclusion. For children, the loss of a stable home can
disrupt schooling, relationships, and access to community resources, all of
which are important to their development and well-being (Tex. Prop. Code §
92.0081).
Judicial Recognition of Instability as Detrimental
Texas courts have recognized that conduct resulting in instability and
uncertainty can itself endanger a child’s well-being, even in the absence of
direct evidence of harm. In In re S.C.M., 01-22-00964-CV (Tex. App. Jun 08,
2023), the court held that endangerment does not require proof of intent or
actual harm; it is sufficient if the parent’s conduct creates instability or
uncertainty. The court emphasized that a life of uncertainty and instability is
inherently detrimental to a child’s physical and emotional well-being. This

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
principle applies directly to self-help eviction, which by its nature creates
instability and uncertainty for the child.
The Holley v. Adams factors, as cited in In re S.C.M., include the stability of
the home and the child’s current and future needs as central considerations
in the best-interest analysis. Self-help eviction undermines both of these
factors by disrupting the child’s living situation and creating uncertainty
about their future.
Distinguishing Cases Where No Actual Instability Occurs
It is important to distinguish situations where a notice to vacate or potential
eviction does not result in actual instability or harm. In In re E.F., 591 S.W.
3d 138 (Tex. App. 2019), the court found that, where the parent was being
rehoused before the deadline and there was no evidence of neglect, abuse,
or endangerment, housing issues alone did not establish detriment to the
child’s best interests. This case suggests that the mere possibility of
instability is not sufficient; there must be evidence that the child’s stability,
safety, or well-being is actually threatened.
However, self-help eviction is distinguishable from a mere notice to vacate
or a pending eviction where alternative housing is secured in advance. Self-
help eviction typically involves immediate and unplanned removal from the
home, often without arrangements for alternative shelter or continuity of
care. This abrupt disruption is precisely the type of instability that Texas law
and courts recognize as detrimental to the child’s best interests.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the authorities make clear that self-help eviction is generally
detrimental to the best interests of children, there may be exceptions in
cases where the eviction does not result in actual instability or where
alternative arrangements are made in advance to ensure the child’s
continued stability and well-being. For example, if a parent is evicted but
immediately rehoused in a stable environment without interruption to the
child’s care, schooling, or routines, the detriment may be mitigated, as
suggested by In re E.F..
Additionally, the analysis may differ if the self-help eviction is carried out in
response to an immediate threat to the child’s safety or well-being, though
such circumstances would likely involve evidence of danger and fall outside
the scope of the present question.
Conclusion
In summary, self-help eviction is detrimental to the best interests of children
under Texas law, even in the absence of evidence of direct danger, because it
disrupts the stability, continuity, and security that are essential to their
welfare. The legislative framework and case law make clear that instability
and uncertainty alone can endanger a child’s well-being, and actions that
create such conditions are contrary to the child’s best interests. While there

may be exceptions in cases where alternative arrangements are made to
preserve stability, the general rule is that self-help eviction is inherently
harmful to children’s welfare and should be avoided in favor of judicial
processes that protect their interests.

In re E.F., 591 S.W.3d 138 (Tex. App. 2019)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Without this evidence, the only evidence raising a concern about appellant's
housing is that appellant received a 'notice to vacate' due to lease violations
of having unauthorized tenants and her therapy dog... There is no evidence
of a 'pending eviction.' And, although the majority states an 'eviction was
imminent,' the undisputed evidence establishes SAMMinistries was
rehousing appellant before the deadline for her to vacate." ... "There is also
no evidence that allowing appellant access to the children would place the
children in emotional and physical danger." ... "There is no evidence of
actual neglect. There is no evidence of abuse. There is no evidence of
endangerment. There is no evidence that appellant could not meet the
children's needs.
Summary
The opinion addresses housing instability via a notice to vacate and
distinguishes it from an actual eviction, noting rehousing was arranged and
no endangerment evidence existed. It emphasizes that best-interest findings
focus on concrete risk to the child; absent evidence of abuse, neglect, or
endangerment, housing issues alone (like a notice to vacate) do not show
detriment to the children's best interests. This informs arguments that a
self-help eviction or eviction-related instability, without proof of danger, is
insufficient to establish detriment.

The Department does not need to establish that a parent intended to
endanger a child to support termination based on endangerment... Nor is it
necessary to establish that the parent's conduct was directed at the child or
caused actual harm; rather, it is sufficient if the parent's conduct endangers
the child's well-being... 'As a general rule, conduct that subjects a child to a
life of uncertainty and instability endangers the physical and emotional well-
being of a child.' ... In Holley v. Adams, the Supreme Court of Texas

identified several nonexclusive factors... (2) the child's current and future
physical and emotional needs; (3) the current and future physical danger to
the child; ... (7) the stability of the home or proposed placement...
Summary
The passages establish that actual harm or danger need not be proven;
endangerment can be inferred from parental conduct that creates instability
and uncertainty. Under Holley, stability of the home and the child’s current
and future needs are central to best-interest analysis. Thus, even absent
direct evidence of danger, actions like self-help eviction that disrupt housing
and create instability can weigh against best interests by endangering
emotional/physical well-being through uncertainty and instability.
Tex. Fam. Code § 153.001 Tex. Fam. Code § 153.001 Public Policy
Extract
The public policy of this state is to: assure that children will have frequent
and continuing contact with parents who have shown the ability to act in the
best interest of the child; provide a safe, stable, and nonviolent environment
for the child; and encourage parents to share in the rights and duties of
raising their child after the parents have separated or dissolved their
marriage.
Summary
Step by step: The statute articulates core best-interest factors—frequent and
continuing contact with capable parents; safety, stability, and nonviolence;
and shared parental rights/duties. A self-help eviction by one parent (outside
judicial process) tends to disrupt the child’s stability and continuity of
contact and undermines cooperative sharing of rights/duties. Even without
evidence of danger, such unilateral displacement can impair the statutory
goals of stability and frequent contact, thus contravening the best-interest
policy.

Summary
Texas law generally prohibits excluding a residential tenant without judicial
process, except for narrow, regulated lockout circumstances, and provides
remedies and penalties for violations. While the statute does not address
child welfare directly, unlawful self-help exclusion foreseeably disrupts a
child's housing stability, access to belongings, schooling, and routines.
Because the statute mandates judicial process to protect tenants’ possessory
rights and continuity of occupancy, a landlord’s self-help exclusion—being
unlawful and destabilizing—can be argued as contrary to the children’s best
interests even absent evidence of danger, as it creates housing instability
and potential hardship the statute seeks to prevent.

the prompt and permanent placement of the child in a safe environment is
presumed to be in the child's best interest." ... courts consider whether
parents can provide "a safe physical home environment;" whether they
provide "guidance and supervision consistent with the child's safety;" and
"protection from repeated exposure to violence even though the violence
may not be directed at the child;" as well as the family's "willingness and
ability ... to effect positive environmental and personal changes within a
reasonable period of time" and "to seek out, accept, and complete
counseling services and to cooperate with and facilitate an appropriate
agency's close supervision.
Summary
The statute frames “best interest” around safety, stability, and parental
capacity to provide a safe physical home, appropriate supervision, and
protection from exposure to violence or instability, even if not directed at the
child. A self-help eviction (lockout/constructive eviction without judicial
process) threatens housing stability and safety, disrupts supervision and
routine, and can expose children to conflict or potential violence,
undermining the “safe physical home environment” and prompt, permanent
placement presumption. It also reflects on the parent’s willingness/ability to
effect positive environmental changes and cooperate with appropriate
supervision.

child's care, custody, or welfare to permit the child to return to the child's

Summary
The definitions establish that actions creating immediate danger to a child’s
physical health or safety, or failures to provide shelter, can constitute
neglect even absent proof of current injury. A self-help eviction that renders
children homeless, unstable, or without necessary shelter, or places them in
situations posing immediate danger, can fall within “neglect.” Thus, the
best-interest analysis can treat self-help eviction as detrimental because it
risks immediate danger and loss of shelter, independent of evidence of direct
physical danger at the moment.
