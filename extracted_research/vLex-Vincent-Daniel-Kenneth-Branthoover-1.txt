Question
Daniel Kenneth Branthoover
Answer
Assessment of Daniel Kenneth Branthoover as a Party to Litigation
This assessment analyzes Daniel Kenneth Branthoover's litigation history based on eleven cases found matching the search criteria. Given this limited sample
size, the findings may not fully represent his complete litigation experience.
Typical Role in Cases: Mr. Branthoover has appeared as both a plaintiff and defendant. He was most frequently a defendant in debt collection (2009-20160-158
Wachovia Dealer Services, Inc., Plaintiff, v. Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, Defendant. and J03-3J5 FARMERS & MERCHANTS STATE BANK vs. DANIEL
KENNETH BRANTHOOVER), eviction (E14-0617J5 Mingzhi Guo C/O ONEprop vs Daniel Kenneth Branthoover And All Other Occupants), and criminal cases
(CR-2010-06730-A The State of Texas vs Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, CR-2010-06732-A The State of Texas vs Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, 04-TR-20-04680
The State of Texas vs. Daniel Branthoover, and 16-01299J5 The State of Texas vs Daniel Branthoover). He was the petitioner in two divorce cases
(2010-61742-393 In the Matter of the Marriage of Daniel Kenneth Branthoover and Kristine N Branthoover and 2010-50599-367 In the Matter of the Marriage of
Daniel Kenneth Branthoover and Kristine N Branthoover) and appeared as a party in a bankruptcy case (4:05-bk-46170 Daniel Kenneth Branthoover and Kristine
Nicole Branthoover). His role in CR-2010-06730-A and CR-2010-06732-A is unclear, as the dockets discuss a "Jim Crouch."
Types of Cases: The cases found span a variety of legal areas, including divorce (with and without children), debt collection, eviction, criminal misdemeanors,
and bankruptcy. This suggests a diverse legal history.
Effectiveness in Motion Practice: The cases found offer limited insight into Mr. Branthoover's motion practice effectiveness. In some instances, such as the
divorce cases, he appears to have cooperated and reached agreements, leading to relatively swift resolutions. However, in other cases, particularly debt
collection and eviction, default judgments and dismissals suggest a lack of active participation or effective defense strategy. In the criminal cases where his role is
unclear, there was extensive motion practice by his counsel.
Average Case Duration: The average duration of the analyzed cases is difficult to calculate precisely due to variations in case types and outcomes. The divorce
cases were resolved relatively quickly (around 3 months), while the debt collection and criminal cases extended over longer periods (several months to over two
years). These durations appear generally consistent with industry averages for similar case types, though the sample size is too small to draw definitive
conclusions.
Success Rate and Notable Outcomes: Defining "success" depends on the context of each case. In the divorce cases, reaching agreed decrees could be
considered successful. However, the default judgments in debt collection cases and dismissals in other matters suggest less favorable outcomes. A precise
success rate cannot be calculated due to the limited sample size and ambiguous outcomes in some cases.
How Most Cases Tend to End: The cases found ended in various ways, including agreed decrees (divorce), default judgments (debt collection), dismissals
(eviction and one divorce), and discharge from probation (criminal). There is no clear pattern of settlement or trial preference.
Most Significant or Noteworthy Cases: The two divorce cases (2010-61742-393 and 2010-50599-367) and the bankruptcy case (4:05-bk-46170) are
noteworthy as they provide insight into his personal and financial circumstances. The debt collection cases (2009-20160-158 and J03-3J5) highlight potential
financial vulnerabilities.
Attorneys/Law Firms: The cases found do not reveal a consistent pattern of attorney or law firm representation. Different attorneys were involved in various
cases, suggesting he may not have a preferred legal team.
Use of Expert Witnesses: There is no evidence of expert witness involvement in any of the analyzed cases.
Additional Insights: The diversity of case types suggests a complex legal history. The presence of multiple cases in Denton County, Texas, indicates a
geographic focus for his legal activities. The lack of consistent legal representation may indicate a tendency to handle some legal matters pro se or to seek
different counsel for different issues.
While these eleven cases provide some insight into Mr. Branthoover's litigation history, a broader search is recommended for a more comprehensive
understanding. To improve your results, consider starting with a broader search and date range, then refine as needed. Include synonyms, variations, and both
industry-specific and common terms alike (e.g. searching for "contract" and "agreement"). You may also need to account for jurisdictional differences in
terminology. If you are still not locating results, please visit the Docket Alarm coverage page to verify we monitor your court of interest. We continuously expand

Background: The cause of action in this case is a violation of a protective order, as indicated by the plea of nolo contendere entered by the defendant, Jim
Crouch, on May 16, 2011. The factual background reveals that the defendant was subjected to a deferred adjudication and placed on probation for 18 months,
including community service, following the violation. The case originated with a complaint and information filed on October 14, 2010, which led to an arrest
warrant affidavit on September 23, 2010.

regarding a violation of a protective order. Notably, Daniel Kenneth Branthoover's counsel, Jim Crouch, filed a motion to withdraw as counsel, indicating potential
changes in representation or strategy. The docket reflects a pattern of resetting hearings and motions, demonstrating a tactical approach to navigate the legal
proceedings efficiently. Ultimately, the case culminated in a plea of nolo contendere and a deferred adjudication with probation, suggesting a successful
resolution for the defendant under the circumstances.
Duration: The case lasted from October 14, 2010, when the complaint was filed, until November 19, 2012, when the discharge from probation occurred, totaling
approximately 2 years and 1 month. This duration reflects the timeline of various hearings, plea agreements, and the eventual conclusion of the probation period.

closed with a discharge from probation or community supervision on November 19, 2012, and is currently classified as inactive and disposed.

The defendant ultimately received deferred adjudication and probation, suggesting a resolution without a trial. The case appears to be relatively straightforward in
terms of legal issues, primarily revolving around the defendant's compliance with the terms of probation and the protective order. Overall, the case's complexity is
moderate, primarily due to the procedural history and the nature of the charges involved.

Monetary value: The docket indicates that the case involved a violation of a protective order, resulting in a deferred adjudication and a probation term of 18
months with community service requirements. However, there is no specific monetary amount mentioned in the entries, so it is difficult to estimate the financial
stakes involved. Given the nature of the case, if any financial penalties or restitution were applicable, they would likely be modest, possibly ranging in the low
thousands if fines were imposed.

discharge from probation on January 28, 2013, which suggests the conclusion of the case proceedings.
Background: The cause of action in this case is a violation of a protective order, as indicated by the multiple entries regarding probation and deferred
adjudication. The factual background reveals that the defendant, Jim Crouch, faced charges related to this violation, leading to various hearings, pleas, and
probation terms beginning in late 2010 and culminating in discharge from probation in early 2013. The defendant entered a plea of nolo contendere and was
subsequently placed on probation, which was later extended due to additional violations.
Motion practice: Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, represented by counsel Derek A. Adame, engaged in extensive motion practice culminating in a plea of nolo
contendere for violating a protective order, leading to a deferred adjudication sentence of 18 months probation and 80 hours of community service. The docket

Complexity: The case involves a misdemeanor charge for violation of a protective order, with a history of plea hearings, continuances, and probation terms. The
defendant received deferred adjudication, indicating an effort towards rehabilitation rather than punishment. The docket entries reflect multiple procedural steps
typical in misdemeanor cases, but the overall complexity appears low, as it is primarily focused on probation and compliance rather than extensive litigation or
multiple legal issues. The case is now inactive and disposed, suggesting resolution without further legal challenges.
Experts: The docket entries do not indicate the involvement of any expert witnesses in the case concerning Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, who was represented
by counsel Derek A. Adame. The entries focus primarily on procedural matters, such as plea hearings, probation details, and continuances, without mention of

leading up to the dismissal suggest that there were issues with service and response, but ultimately, the case is no longer active.
Background: The cause of action in this case appears to be a Forcible Entry and Detainer, as indicated by the various entries related to citations and hearings.
The factual background suggests that the plaintiff, presumably seeking possession of a property, initiated the case against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, who was
served with a citation on December 18, 2014. However, the case faced multiple delays and was ultimately dismissed for want of prosecution on December 29,
2014, indicating a failure to move forward with the proceedings.

involved several critical steps, including initial unsuccessful attempts to serve Branthoover, leading to a court-ordered alternative service on December 18, 2014, 
with a response due by December 23, 2014. However, following the return of the citation and a subsequent reset of the trial date, the case ultimately faced

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
dismissal for want of prosecution on December 29, 2014, indicating a failure to pursue the matter actively after service was achieved. This sequence highlights
the importance of prompt legal action and diligent prosecution in eviction cases, especially when facing procedural hurdles.
Duration: The case was filed on December 15, 2014, and concluded with a dismissal for want of prosecution on December 29, 2014. Thus, the case lasted a
total of 14 days from start to finish.
Outcome: The case was dismissed for want of prosecution on December 29, 2014, after a series of procedural steps including the issuance of citations and
attempts at service, which were ultimately unsuccessful. The court reset the trial date multiple times but ultimately did not proceed with the hearing, leading to the
dismissal. The case status is officially recorded as dismissed, indicating that the plaintiff failed to take necessary actions to advance the case.
Complexity: The case appears to be relatively straightforward, involving an eviction proceeding under Texas law, specifically a Forcible Entry and Detainer
action. The docket entries indicate multiple attempts to serve the citation, which were met with challenges, including unserved citations and a dismissal for want of
prosecution. The case was reset multiple times, suggesting procedural delays rather than substantive complexity. Overall, the case does not exhibit significant
legal intricacies typical of more complex litigation.
Experts: There is no indication in the docket entries that any experts were involved in the case. The entries primarily focus on the procedural aspects of the
forcible entry and detainer action, including service issues and the eventual dismissal for want of prosecution. Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, the Defendant, does
not appear to have engaged any expert witnesses or consultants based on the provided information.
Monetary value: The docket entries indicate that this case involved a "Forcible Entry and Detainer," which typically concerns eviction proceedings rather than a
monetary claim for damages. Consequently, there is no specific monetary amount indicated in the entries, and it is reasonable to estimate the case's value as
relatively low, potentially under $10,000, given the nature of the proceedings.

nolo contendere plea and was subsequently found guilty of the same charge, signaling a potential strategy for the prosecution. As of the entries in the docket,
there are no motions filed by the Defendant, indicating a lack of active legal maneuvering on his part at this stage of the proceedings. The absence of counsel
listed for either party may suggest that both parties are either self-represented or that legal representation has not been formally entered on the record.
