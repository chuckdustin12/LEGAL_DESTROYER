Question
Does a district judge in Texas have subject matter jurisdiction to order a party to vacate their residence at a show cause hearing for a protective order without
holding the hearing or receiving evidence?
Answer (Texas)
Short response
A district judge in Texas does not have subject matter jurisdiction to order a party to vacate their residence at a show cause hearing for a protective order without
holding the hearing or receiving evidence. Both the Texas Family Code and case law consistently require courts to hold hearings and make specific findings
based on evidence before issuing protective orders that exclude individuals from their residences.
Summary
Under Texas law, district courts have subject matter jurisdiction over protective order proceedings, but this jurisdiction must be exercised in compliance with
statutory procedural requirements. The Texas Family Code explicitly requires courts to hold hearings before issuing final protective orders and to make specific
findings that family violence has occurred and is likely to occur in the future. While temporary ex parte orders may be issued without a hearing in emergency
situations, even these require sworn affidavits and testimony when they involve removing someone from their residence.
The case law consistently reinforces these statutory requirements, emphasizing that due process demands notice and an opportunity to be heard before a court
can order a party to vacate their residence as part of a protective order. Courts have repeatedly held that findings regarding family violence must be made "at the
close of a hearing," indicating that the hearing is a mandatory prerequisite. While courts can issue default orders when a respondent fails to appear after proper
notice, they cannot dispense with the requirement of holding the hearing itself or receiving evidence from the applicant.
Background and Relevant Legislation
Texas Family Code Provisions
The Texas Family Code contains several provisions that govern the issuance of protective orders and specifically address when a court may order a party to
vacate their residence.
Section 85.001 of the Texas Family Code establishes the requirements for findings and orders in protective order cases: "At the close of a hearing on an
application for a protective order, the court shall find whether family violence has occurred." Tex. Fam. Code § 85.001. This language unambiguously requires a
hearing to be held before a protective order can be issued, and findings must be made at the conclusion of this hearing.
For temporary ex parte orders, Tex. Fam. Code § 83.001 provides: "If the court finds from the information contained in an application for a protective order that
there is a clear and present danger of family violence, the court, without further notice to the individual alleged to have committed family violence and without a
hearing, may enter a temporary ex parte order for the protection of the applicant or any other member of the family or household of the applicant." This provision
does permit orders without hearings, but only on a temporary, emergency basis.
However, when it comes specifically to excluding someone from their residence through a temporary ex parte order, Tex. Fam. Code § 83.006 imposes additional
requirements: "Subject to the limitations of Section FAMILY CODE 85.021, a person may only be excluded from the occupancy of the person's residence by a
temporary ex parte order under this chapter if the applicant: files a sworn affidavit that provides a detailed description of the facts and circumstances requiring the
exclusion of the person from the residence; and appears in person to testify at a temporary ex parte hearing to justify the issuance of the order without notice."
Furthermore, this section requires the court to make specific findings from the "required affidavit and testimony" before rendering a temporary ex parte order
excluding a person from their residence.
For default orders, Tex. Fam. Code § 85.006 states: "a court may render a protective order that is binding on a respondent who does not attend a hearing if: the
respondent received service of the application and notice of the hearing; and proof of service was filed with the court before the hearing." This section
contemplates that a hearing will be held, even if the respondent does not attend.
The Texas Code of Criminal Procedure similarly requires hearings for protective orders. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 7B.003 states: "At the close of a hearing on an
application for a protective order under this subchapter, the court shall find whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the applicant is the victim of
sexual assault or abuse, indecent assault, stalking, or trafficking." This language also presupposes that a hearing must be held.
For temporary ex parte orders under the Code of Criminal Procedure, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 7B.002 provides: "If the court finds from the information contained
in an application for a protective order that there is a clear and present danger of sexual assault or abuse, indecent assault, stalking, trafficking, or other harm to
the applicant, the court, without further notice to the alleged offender and without a hearing, may issue a temporary ex parte order for the protection of the
applicant or any other member of the applicant's family or household." Like the Family Code provision, this allows for temporary orders without hearings, but only
in emergency situations.
Relevant Case Law
Texas courts have consistently interpreted these statutory provisions to require hearings before protective orders can be issued, particularly when they involve
excluding someone from their residence.
In In re V.K., 607 S.W.3d 471 (Tex. App. 2020), the court specifically addressed the requirements for ordering someone to vacate their residence: "Section 
83.001 provides that a trial court may render a temporary ex parte protective order 'without a hearing.' Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 83.001(a). If the applicant seeks a

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
temporary ex parte protective order in which the trial court excludes a person from the occupancy of the person's residence, section 83.006 requires the applicant
to file a sworn affidavit and to 'appear in person to testify at a temporary ex parte hearing.' Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 83.006(a). Thus, to grant this type of temporary
ex parte protective order a trial court must hold a hearing. See id."
The Texas Supreme Court in Stary v. Ethridge, 23-0067 (Tex. May 02, 2025) emphasized that "The Family Code authorizes protective orders to provide
expedited, temporary protection upon a finding of family violence. Upon a finding that family violence has occurred, a trial court may limit or prohibit contact with
affected family members for up to two years." This language reinforces that a finding of family violence is a prerequisite to issuing a protective order that restricts
a party's rights, including their right to occupy their residence.
In Johnson v. Vernon, 05-24-00179-CV (Tex. App. Jan 27, 2025), the court explained: "The applicant for a protective order is entitled to a hearing not later than
fourteen days after the date of filing an application unless the applicant requests a later date. Roper, 493 S.W.3d at 630 (citing Fam. § 84.001(a)). At the close of
the hearing on the application for a protective order, the trial court must find whether family violence has occurred and is likely to occur in the future. Id. (citing
Fam. § 85.001(a)). If the court makes those findings, it must render a protective order applying to the person found to have committed family violence. Id. (citing
Fam. §§ 81.001, 85.022)." This emphasizes the mandatory nature of the hearing and the findings that must be made at its conclusion.
The court in Taylor v. Norton, 06-24-00015-CV (Tex. App. Sep 13, 2024) noted an important distinction: "In contrast, a temporary ex parte protective order is
entered based on 'the information contained in an application for a protective order... [and] without further notice to the individual alleged to have committed family
violence and without a hearing.' Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 83.001(a)." This highlights that while temporary ex parte orders can be issued without hearings, this is an
exception to the general rule requiring hearings for protective orders.
In Velasquez v. Rayon, the court reiterated: "A court shall render a protective order as provided by Section 85.001(b) if the court finds that family violence has
occurred and is likely to occur in the future." Tex. Fam. Code § 81.001. Section 85.001 provides: Tex. Fam. Code § 85.001. To issue a family-violence protective
order, the trial court is required to find whether family violence has occurred and whether family violence is likely to occur in the future." This underscores that
findings about past and potential future family violence are essential before a protective order can be issued.
Sharp v. Jimmerson, 01-20-00360-CV (Tex. App. Aug 17, 2021) further clarified: "After holding a hearing on the application and before issuing a protective order
under either the Family Code or Chapter 7A, the trial court is required to make certain findings. For a family-violence protective order under the Family Code, the
trial court is required to find whether family violence has occurred and whether family violence is likely to occur in the future. TEX. FAM. CODE § 85.001(a)." The
court's language clearly indicates that a hearing must be held before the required findings can be made.
In Adimora-Nweke v. Yarbrough, NO. 14-19-00426-CV (Tex. App. May 13, 2021), the court explained the notice requirements: "When issuance of a protective
order is sought under Chapter 85 of the Family Code, the notice requirements of Chapter 82 apply. The clerk of the court must issue a notice that an application
for a protective order has been filed. Tex. Fam. Code § 82.042(a). 'Each respondent to an application for protective order is entitled to service of notice of an
application for protective order.' Id. at § 82.043(a). The notice informs the respondent, among other things, that if he does not attend the hearing a protective
order may be issued against him. See id. at § 82.041(b). The notice 'must be served in the same manner as citation under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure,
except that service by publication is not authorized.' Id. at § 82.043(c)." This emphasizes that notice of the hearing is required, which presupposes that a hearing
will be held.
Richardson v. Earle, 01-20-00630-CV (Tex. App. Dec 14, 2021) addressed default orders: "A trial court may render a protective order that is binding on a
respondent who does not attend a hearing if the respondent received service of the application and notice of the hearing, and proof of service was filed with the
court before the hearing. TEX. FAM. CODE § 85.006. Notice of the application must be served in the same manner as citation under the Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure, excluding publication. Id. § 82.043; see TEX. R. CIV. P. 106. The contents of the notice must include the date, time, and place of the hearing, inter
alia, and include the statement: 'If you do not attend the hearing, a default judgment may be taken and a protective order may be issued against you.' TEX. FAM.
CODE § 82.041." This clarifies that while a respondent's presence is not required, the hearing itself must still be held.
The importance of holding hearings was highlighted in In re Nanua, 13-22-00103-CV (Tex. App. Jun 06, 2022), where the court noted: "Navneet's counsel
informed the court that there had never been a hearing on Navneet's applications for a protective order, repeatedly requested the court to hold a hearing on her
applications, advised the court that his witnesses were present to testify regarding her request for protection, noted that a finding of domestic violence would
affect other issues in the case such as visitation and spousal maintenance, and repeatedly objected to the trial court's failure to hold a hearing on the request for
a protective order." This suggests that the trial court's failure to hold a hearing was considered legally problematic.
Finally, In re Epperson, 53 S.W.3d 752 (Tex. App. 2001) addressed the issue of jurisdiction: "Texas Department of Transportation v. Jones, 8 S.W.3d 636, 637
(Tex. 1999). Our task is to examine the pleadings, to take as true the facts pled, and to determine whether those facts support jurisdiction in the trial court." This
case confirms that district courts do have subject matter jurisdiction over protective order proceedings, but this jurisdiction must be exercised in accordance with
statutory requirements.
Analysis
Subject Matter Jurisdiction vs. Procedural Requirements
The question presented involves two separate but related concepts: subject matter jurisdiction and procedural requirements. Subject matter jurisdiction refers to a
court's power to hear a particular type of case, while procedural requirements govern how that power must be exercised.
District courts in Texas clearly have subject matter jurisdiction over protective order proceedings. As noted in Dupuy v. Williams, 14-19-00463-CV (Tex. App. Dec
02, 2021): "a plain reading of the statute shows that the 280th District Court of Harris County is a proper court to issue the protective order Williams sought. A
protective order pursuant to Chapter 7A could be filed in: a district court, juvenile court having the jurisdiction of a district court, statutory county court, or
constitutional county court in: (A) the county in which the applicant resides; (B) the county in which the alleged offender resides; or (C) any county in which an
element of the alleged offense occurred; or any court with jurisdiction over a protective order under Title 4, Family Code, involving the same parties named in the
application. ... The trial court properly exercised jurisdiction over this proceeding, and the order is not void for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction."

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
However, having subject matter jurisdiction does not mean a court can disregard statutory procedural requirements. The Texas Family Code and Code of
Criminal Procedure establish specific procedures that must be followed before a protective order can be issued, particularly when it involves ordering someone to
vacate their residence.
Hearings Required for Final Protective Orders
The statutory language is clear that hearings are required before final protective orders can be issued. Tex. Fam. Code § 85.001 states that findings must be
made "[a]t the close of a hearing on an application for a protective order," which presupposes that a hearing must be held. The multiple case decisions cited
above consistently interpret this provision as requiring a hearing.
The purpose of this requirement is to protect due process rights. Before a person can be ordered to vacate their residence—a significant deprivation of
rights—they must be given notice and an opportunity to be heard. As noted in Adimora-Nweke v. Yarbrough, "Each respondent to an application for protective
order is entitled to service of notice of an application for protective order."
Temporary Ex Parte Orders: A Limited Exception
The only exception to the hearing requirement is for temporary ex parte orders under Tex. Fam. Code § 83.001 and Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 7B.002, which
permit orders "without further notice to the individual alleged to have committed family violence and without a hearing." However, these are emergency measures
that can only be issued upon finding "a clear and present danger" based on the application's information.
Importantly, even this exception has further limitations when it comes to ordering someone to vacate their residence. As clarified in In re V.K., 607 S.W.3d 471
(Tex. App. 2020), "If the applicant seeks a temporary ex parte protective order in which the trial court excludes a person from the occupancy of the person's
residence, section 83.006 requires the applicant to file a sworn affidavit and to 'appear in person to testify at a temporary ex parte hearing.' Tex. Fam. Code Ann.
§ 83.006(a). Thus, to grant this type of temporary ex parte protective order a trial court must hold a hearing. See id."
Tex. Fam. Code § 83.006 further requires that "Before the court may render a temporary ex parte order excluding a person from the person's residence, the court
must find from the required affidavit and testimony that: the applicant requesting the excluding order either resides on the premises or has resided there within 30
days before the date the application was filed; the person to be excluded has within the 30 days before the date the application was filed committed family
violence against a member of the household; and there is a clear and present danger that the person to be excluded is likely to commit family violence against a
member of the household." These findings can only be made after reviewing evidence, which includes both a sworn affidavit and testimony.
Default Orders Do Not Eliminate the Hearing Requirement
While Tex. Fam. Code § 85.006 allows a court to "render a protective order that is binding on a respondent who does not attend a hearing if: the respondent
received service of the application and notice of the hearing; and proof of service was filed with the court before the hearing," this does not eliminate the
requirement to hold the hearing itself. It merely allows the hearing to proceed in the respondent's absence.
As explained in Richardson v. Earle, 01-20-00630-CV (Tex. App. Dec 14, 2021), the notice to the respondent must include "the date, time, and place of the
hearing" and a statement that "If you do not attend the hearing, a default judgment may be taken and a protective order may be issued against you." This
language clearly contemplates that a hearing will be held, even if the respondent chooses not to attend.
Evidence Requirements
Multiple provisions require courts to make specific findings based on evidence before issuing protective orders. Tex. Fam. Code § 85.001 requires findings on
whether family violence has occurred and is likely to occur in the future. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 7B.003 requires findings of "reasonable grounds to believe that
the applicant is the victim of sexual assault or abuse, indecent assault, stalking, or trafficking." These findings cannot be made without receiving evidence.
As emphasized in In re Epperson, 53 S.W.3d 752 (Tex. App. 2001), "A trial court shall render a protective order if the court finds that family violence (1) has
occurred and (2) is likely to occur in the future." These findings must be based on evidence presented at a hearing.
Exceptions and Caveats
Show Cause Hearings
The question specifically references "a show cause hearing for a protective order without holding the hearing." It's important to note that a show cause hearing is
itself a type of hearing. As noted in Joseph v. Jack, 624 S.W.3d 1 (Tex. App. 2021), "The trial court issued a temporary ex parte protective order and ordered
Joseph to appear on March 7, 2018, and show cause that a protective order should not issue against him." This indicates that after a temporary ex parte order is
issued, a show cause hearing is scheduled where the respondent can present their case.
If a show cause hearing is scheduled but the respondent fails to appear after proper notice, the court can proceed with the hearing and issue orders based on the
evidence presented by the applicant. However, the court cannot skip the hearing entirely or refuse to receive evidence.
Jurisdiction vs. Error
A distinction should be made between acts that exceed a court's jurisdiction and those that constitute procedural errors. A district court has subject matter
jurisdiction over protective order proceedings, but failing to hold a required hearing or receive evidence would likely be considered a procedural error or abuse of
discretion rather than a jurisdictional defect.
As stated in In re Epperson, 53 S.W.3d 752 (Tex. App. 2001), the task of determining jurisdiction involves examining "the pleadings, to take as true the facts pled,
and to determine whether those facts support jurisdiction in the trial court." The mere fact that a court has jurisdiction over protective order proceedings does not
mean it can disregard statutory requirements.

Conclusion
Based on the provided materials, a district judge in Texas does not have subject matter jurisdiction to order a party to vacate their residence at a show cause
hearing for a protective order without holding the hearing or receiving evidence. While district courts clearly have jurisdiction over protective order proceedings,
this jurisdiction must be exercised in accordance with statutory procedural requirements.
The Texas Family Code and Code of Criminal Procedure explicitly require courts to hold hearings before issuing final protective orders and to make specific
findings that family violence has occurred and is likely to occur in the future. Even for temporary ex parte orders that exclude a party from their residence, a
hearing is required where the applicant must testify in person.
The case law consistently reinforces these statutory requirements, emphasizing that due process demands notice and an opportunity to be heard before a court
can order a party to vacate their residence as part of a protective order. Courts have repeatedly held that findings regarding family violence must be made "at the
close of a hearing," indicating that the hearing is a mandatory prerequisite.
While courts can issue default orders when a respondent fails to appear after proper notice, they cannot dispense with the requirement of holding the hearing
itself or receiving evidence from the applicant. To do so would violate both the explicit statutory requirements and fundamental principles of due process.
Therefore, a district judge who orders a party to vacate their residence without holding a hearing or receiving evidence would be acting outside the bounds of their
lawful authority, even though the court itself has subject matter jurisdiction over the type of case.

Summary
The 280th District Court of Harris County had the proper jurisdiction to issue a protective order under Chapter 7A of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure. This
suggests that district courts in Texas have subject matter jurisdiction to issue protective orders, including potentially ordering a party to vacate their residence, as
part of such proceedings. The passage does not specifically address whether a hearing or evidence is required before such an order can be issued, but it
confirms the court's jurisdiction over the matter.

A trial court may render a protective order that is binding on a respondent who does not attend a hearing if the respondent received service of the application and
notice of the hearing, and proof of service was filed with the court before the hearing. TEX. FAM. CODE § 85.006. Notice of the application must be served in the

Summary
A Texas trial court has the authority to issue a protective order even if the respondent does not attend the hearing, provided that the respondent was served with
notice of the application and hearing, and proof of service was filed with the court. This suggests that the court can proceed with issuing orders related to the
protective order, such as vacating a residence, without the respondent's presence, as long as due process requirements regarding notice are met.

the request for a protective order.
Summary
The trial court in this case did not hold a hearing on the applications for a protective order despite repeated requests and the presence of witnesses. This
suggests that the court did not follow the procedural requirement to hold a hearing before making decisions related to protective orders. The passage highlights
the importance of holding a hearing to consider evidence and testimony before making determinations that could affect visitation and other related issues.

Extract
The trial court issued a temporary ex parte protective order and ordered Joseph to appear on March 7, 2018, and show cause that a protective order should not

Summary
A temporary ex parte protective order can be issued without a hearing if there is a clear and present danger of family violence, as per Texas Family Code §
83.001(a). However, it also shows that the court ordered a show cause hearing, which implies that a hearing is necessary for a final protective order. This
suggests that while temporary orders can be issued without a hearing, a show cause hearing is required for further actions, such as ordering a party to vacate
their residence.
In re Salgado, 53 S.W.3d 752 (Tex. App. 2001)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Salgado first argues that the 394th District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because another court has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction of Elizabeth. The
absence of subject-matter jurisdiction may be raised by a plea to the jurisdiction. Texas Department of Transportation v. Jones, 8 S.W.3d 636, 637 (Tex. 1999).
Our task is to examine the pleadings, to take as true the facts pled, and to determine whether those facts support jurisdiction in the trial court. Texas Association
of Business v. Texas Air Control Board, 852 S.W.2d 440, 446 (Tex. 1993). We construe the pleadings in favor of the pleader. Id. If necessary, we may review the
entire record to determine if there is jurisdiction. Id. Contrary to Salgado's position, Title 4 plainly contemplates that an application for a protective order may be
filed on behalf of a child who is subject to the continuing jurisdiction of a court under Title 5. In such a case, the application must include a copy of each court
order affecting the conservatorship, support, and possession of or access to the child, or a statement that the orders affecting the child are unavailable to the
applicant and that a copy of the orders will be filed with the court before the hearing on the application. Tex.Fam.Code Ann. §§ 82.007. As further evidence that a
court other than the court of continuing jurisdiction may issue a protective order, Section 83.005 provides that a temporary ex parte order prevails over any other
court order issued under Title 5 to the extent of any conflict between the orders. Tex.Fam.Code Ann. §§ 83.005.
Summary
Jurisdictional authority of a district court in Texas to issue protective orders, even when another court has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction. It highlights that under 
Texas Family Code, a protective order can be issued by a court other than the court of continuing jurisdiction, and such orders can prevail over other court orders 
to the extent of any conflict. This suggests that a district judge may have jurisdiction to issue certain orders related to protective orders, even if another court has

continuing jurisdiction.

Summary
The Texas Family Code requires that a trial court must find that family violence has occurred and is likely to occur in the future before rendering a protective
order. This finding must be made at the close of a hearing on an application for a protective order. Therefore, the court must hold a hearing and receive evidence
to make these determinations.

The Family Code authorizes protective orders to provide expedited, temporary protection upon a finding of family violence. Upon a finding that family violence has
occurred, a trial court may limit or prohibit contact with affected family members for up to two years.
Summary
The Texas Family Code allows for protective orders to be issued to provide temporary protection upon a finding of family violence. This implies that a hearing and
evidence are necessary to establish that family violence has occurred before such orders can be issued. Therefore, a district judge would not have the jurisdiction
to order a party to vacate their residence without holding a hearing or receiving evidence, as the issuance of protective orders requires a finding of family
violence.

The applicant for a protective order is entitled to a hearing not later than fourteen days after the date of filing an application unless the applicant requests a later
date. Roper, 493 S.W.3d at 630 (citing Fam. § 84.001(a)). At the close of the hearing on the application for a protective order, the trial court must find whether
family violence has occurred and is likely to occur in the future. Id. (citing Fam. § 85.001(a)). If the court makes those findings, it must render a protective order
applying to the person found to have committed family violence. Id. (citing Fam. §§ 81.001, 85.022).
Summary
The Texas Family Code requires a hearing to be held within fourteen days of filing an application for a protective order unless a later date is requested by the
applicant. During this hearing, the court must determine whether family violence has occurred and is likely to occur in the future before issuing a protective order.
This implies that a district judge does not have the jurisdiction to order a party to vacate their residence without holding a hearing and receiving evidence, as the
findings of family violence are prerequisites for rendering such an order.

A court shall render a protective order as provided by Section 85.001(b) if the court finds that family violence has occurred and is likely to occur in the future."
Tex. Fam. Code § 81.001. Section 85.001 provides: Tex. Fam. Code § 85.001. To issue a family-violence protective order, the trial court is required to find
whether family violence has occurred and whether family violence is likely to occur in the future.
Summary
For a court to issue a family-violence protective order, it must find that family violence has occurred and is likely to occur in the future. This implies that evidence
must be presented and evaluated to make such findings. Therefore, a district judge would not have the jurisdiction to order a party to vacate their residence
without holding a hearing or receiving evidence, as these findings are prerequisites for issuing a protective order.
Velasquez v. Rayon
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A court shall render a protective order as provided by Section 85.001(b) if the court finds that family violence has occurred and is likely to occur in the future."
Tex. Fam. Code § 81.001. Section 85.001 provides: Tex. Fam. Code § 85.001. To issue a family-violence protective order, the trial court is required to find
whether family violence has occurred and whether family violence is likely to occur in the future.
Summary
For a court to issue a family-violence protective order, it must make specific findings that family violence has occurred and is likely to occur in the future. This
implies that a hearing and evidence are necessary to make these findings. Therefore, a district judge would not have the jurisdiction to order a party to vacate
their residence without holding a hearing or receiving evidence, as these steps are essential to determine the occurrence and likelihood of family violence.
Taylor v. Norton, 06-24-00015-CV (Tex. App. Sep 13, 2024)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
In contrast, a temporary ex parte protective order is entered based on 'the information contained in an application for a protective order... [and] without further
notice to the individual alleged to have committed family violence and without a hearing.' Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 83.001(a).
Summary
The passage from the Texas Family Code, as cited in the "Taylor v. Norton" judgment, indicates that a temporary ex parte protective order can be issued without
a hearing, based solely on the information in the application for the protective order. This suggests that a district judge in Texas does have the jurisdiction to issue
such an order without holding a hearing or receiving additional evidence, provided the application demonstrates a clear and present danger of family violence.
Northfell v. Northfell, 01-22-00082-CV (Tex. App. Nov 03, 2022)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Family Code section 81.001 provides that a trial court 'shall render a protective order as provided by Section 85.001(b) if the court finds that family violence has
occurred and is likely to occur in the future.' Id. § 81.001. Section 85.001 provides: Id. § 85.001; see also id. §§ 85.021 (governing contents of protective order
applying to any party), 85.022 (governing contents of protective order applying to person who committed family violence). A trial court may issue a protective
order for a period exceeding two years if it finds that 'the person who is the subject of the protective order' 'committed an act constituting a felony offense involving
family violence against the applicant. . ., regardless of whether the person has been charged with or convicted of the offense.' Id. § 85.025(a-1)(1) (emphasis
added).

Summary
A trial court in Texas has the authority to issue a protective order if it finds that family violence has occurred and is likely to occur in the future. The court must
make these findings based on evidence. The passage does not explicitly address whether a judge can order a party to vacate their residence without holding a
hearing or receiving evidence, but it implies that findings must be made, which typically requires evidence and a hearing.
In re V.K., 607 S.W.3d 471 (Tex. App. 2020)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Section 83.001 provides that a trial court may render a temporary ex parte protective order 'without a hearing.' Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 83.001(a). If the applicant
seeks a temporary ex parte protective order in which the trial court excludes a person from the occupancy of the person's residence, section 83.006 requires the
applicant to file a sworn affidavit and to 'appear in person to testify at a temporary ex parte hearing.' Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 83.006(a). Thus, to grant this type of
temporary ex parte protective order a trial court must hold a hearing. See id.
Summary
The passage from the Texas Family Code indicates that while a temporary ex parte protective order can be issued without a hearing under section 83.001, if the
order involves excluding a person from their residence, section 83.006 mandates a hearing where the applicant must testify in person. This suggests that a district
judge does not have the jurisdiction to order a party to vacate their residence without holding a hearing and receiving evidence when it involves a temporary ex
parte protective order.
Sharp v. Jimmerson, 01-20-00360-CV (Tex. App. Aug 17, 2021)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
After holding a hearing on the application and before issuing a protective order under either the Family Code or Chapter 7A, the trial court is required to make
certain findings. For a family-violence protective order under the Family Code, the trial court is required to find whether family violence has occurred and whether
family violence is likely to occur in the future. TEX. FAM. CODE § 85.001(a); see also Taylor v. Taylor, 608 S.W.3d 265, 272 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2020,
no pet.).
Summary
Before a protective order can be issued under the Texas Family Code or Chapter 7A, a hearing must be held, and the trial court is required to make specific
findings. These findings include determining whether family violence has occurred and whether it is likely to occur in the future. This implies that a district judge
does not have the jurisdiction to order a party to vacate their residence without holding a hearing and making the necessary findings.
Tex. Fam. Code § 85.001 Tex. Fam. Code § 85.001 Required Findings and Orders
Extract
At the close of a hearing on an application for a protective order, the court shall find whether family violence has occurred.
Summary
The court is required to hold a hearing and make a finding on whether family violence has occurred before rendering a protective order. This implies that a judge
cannot order a party to vacate their residence without holding a hearing and receiving evidence, as the finding of family violence is a prerequisite for issuing such
an order.

Extract
(a) At the close of a hearing on an application for a protective order under this subchapter, the court shall find whether there are reasonable grounds to believe
that the applicant is the victim of sexual assault or abuse, indecent assault, stalking, or trafficking.
Summary
The court is required to hold a hearing and make a finding of reasonable grounds to believe that the applicant is a victim before issuing a protective order. This 
implies that a district judge does not have the jurisdiction to order a party to vacate their residence without holding a hearing or receiving evidence, as the statute

mandates a hearing and a finding of reasonable grounds.
Tex. Fam. Code § 261.504 Tex. Fam. Code § 261.504 Required Findings; Issuance of Protective Order
Extract
At the close of a hearing on an application for a protective order under this subchapter, the court shall find whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that:
the child: (A) is a victim of abuse or neglect; or (B) has a history of being abused or neglected; and there is a threat of: (A) immediate or continued abuse or
neglect to the child; (B) someone illegally taking the child from the home in which the child is placed; (C) behavior that poses a threat to the caregiver with whom
the child is placed; or (D) someone committing an act of violence against the child or the child's caregiver.
Summary
The court is required to make specific findings at the close of a hearing on an application for a protective order. The court must determine whether there are
reasonable grounds to believe that the child is a victim of abuse or neglect or has a history of such, and whether there is a threat of immediate or continued abuse
or neglect. This implies that a hearing and the presentation of evidence are necessary before a protective order can be issued.
Tex. Fam. Code § 83.001 Tex. Fam. Code § 83.001 Requirements For Temporary Ex Parte Order
Extract
If the court finds from the information contained in an application for a protective order that there is a clear and present danger of family violence, the court,
without further notice to the individual alleged to have committed family violence and without a hearing, may enter a temporary ex parte order for the protection of
the applicant or any other member of the family or household of the applicant.
Summary
A district judge in Texas can issue a temporary ex parte order without a hearing if there is a clear and present danger of family violence. This suggests that the
judge has the jurisdiction to make such orders without holding a hearing or receiving evidence, provided the application for the protective order demonstrates the
necessary danger.
Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 7B.002 Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 7B.002 Temporary Ex Parte Order
Extract
If the court finds from the information contained in an application for a protective order that there is a clear and present danger of sexual assault or abuse,
indecent assault, stalking, trafficking, or other harm to the applicant, the court, without further notice to the alleged offender and without a hearing, may issue a
temporary ex parte order for the protection of the applicant or any other member of the applicant's family or household.
Summary
A court in Texas can issue a temporary ex parte order for protection without holding a hearing or receiving further evidence if it finds a clear and present danger to
the applicant based on the information in the application for a protective order. This suggests that a district judge does have the jurisdiction to issue such orders
without a hearing under specific circumstances.
Tex. Fam. Code § 83.006 Tex. Fam. Code § 83.006 Exclusion of Party From Residence
Extract
Subject to the limitations of Section FAMILY CODE 85.021, a person may only be excluded from the occupancy of the person's residence by a temporary ex
parte order under this chapter if the applicant: files a sworn affidavit that provides a detailed description of the facts and circumstances requiring the exclusion of
the person from the residence; and appears in person to testify at a temporary ex parte hearing to justify the issuance of the order without notice. Before the court
may render a temporary ex parte order excluding a person from the person's residence, the court must find from the required affidavit and testimony that: the
applicant requesting the excluding order either resides on the premises or has resided there within 30 days before the date the application was filed; the person to
be excluded has within the 30 days before the date the application was filed committed family violence against a member of the household; and there is a clear
and present danger that the person to be excluded is likely to commit family violence against a member of the household.
Summary
A district judge in Texas can issue a temporary ex parte order to exclude a person from their residence. However, this can only be done if the applicant files a 
sworn affidavit with a detailed description of the facts and circumstances and appears in person to testify at a temporary ex parte hearing. The court must find 
from the affidavit and testimony that the applicant resides or has resided on the premises within 30 days before the application, the person to be excluded has 
committed family violence within the last 30 days, and there is a clear and present danger of future family violence. This indicates that a hearing and evidence are

required before such an order can be issued.
Tex. Fam. Code § 85.006 Tex. Fam. Code § 85.006 Default Order
Extract
a court may render a protective order that is binding on a respondent who does not attend a hearing if: the respondent received service of the application and
notice of the hearing; and proof of service was filed with the court before the hearing.
Summary
A Texas court can issue a protective order even if the respondent does not attend the hearing, provided that the respondent was served with the application and
notice of the hearing, and proof of service was filed with the court. This suggests that the court has the authority to issue orders related to protective orders,
potentially including orders to vacate a residence, without holding a hearing or receiving evidence if these conditions are met.
