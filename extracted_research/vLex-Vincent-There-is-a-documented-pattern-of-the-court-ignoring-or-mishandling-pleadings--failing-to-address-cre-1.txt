Question
There is a documented pattern of the court ignoring or mishandling
pleadings, failing to address credible allegations of fraud and misconduct,
and issuing orders without legal justification or proper review. The Texas
Supreme Court has held that recusal is required not only for actual bias but
also where the judge’s conduct creates an appearance of impropriety or
undermines public confidence in the judiciary (Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal
Co., 556 U.S. 868, 872 (2009); Kniatt v. State, 239 S.W.3d 910, 914 (Tex.
App. 2007)). The cumulative effect of Judge Evans’s actions and omissions
has eroded public trust and created an appearance of impropriety, making
recusal necessary to preserve the integrity of the judicial process.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
Texas law requires recusal of a judge not only for actual bias but also when
the judge’s conduct creates an appearance of impropriety or undermines
public confidence in the judiciary; the documented pattern of Judge Evans’s
actions and omissions, as described, meets the threshold for mandatory
recusal to preserve the integrity of the judicial process. The cumulative
effect of mishandling pleadings, failing to address credible allegations, and
issuing unjustified orders supports the necessity of recusal under both
constitutional and procedural standards.
Summary
Under Texas law, judicial recusal is mandated when a judge’s impartiality
might reasonably be questioned, which includes situations where the judge’s
conduct creates an appearance of impropriety or erodes public trust in the
judiciary. The Texas Constitution, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and
binding case law all emphasize that the appearance of impartiality is as
critical as actual impartiality, and that public confidence in the judiciary
must be maintained.
The pattern of conduct attributed to Judge Evans—ignoring or mishandling
pleadings, failing to address credible allegations of fraud and misconduct,
and issuing orders without legal justification—constitutes behavior that,
when viewed cumulatively, would lead a reasonable member of the public to
doubt the judge’s impartiality. As such, recusal is not only appropriate but
required to uphold the integrity of the judicial process and maintain public
confidence, as established by both Texas and federal authorities.

Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
The Texas Constitution provides explicit grounds for the removal or
discipline of judges whose conduct undermines the integrity of the judiciary.
Article 15, Section 6 authorizes the Texas Supreme Court to remove a
district judge for incompetence, partiality, oppression, official misconduct, or
negligent failure to perform judicial duties, as well as for conduct rendering
the judge unfit for office or failing to execute court business in a reasonable
manner (Tex. Const. art. 15 § 6). Article 5, Section 1-a further allows for
removal or discipline of any justice or judge for willful or persistent violation
of Supreme Court rules, incompetence, willful violation of the Code of
Judicial Conduct, or conduct that is inconsistent with proper judicial
performance or casts public discredit on the judiciary (Tex. Const. art. 5 § 1-
a).
Procedurally, 1 Tex. Admin. Code § 155.152 incorporates the grounds for
recusal or disqualification as specified in Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18b,
and provides that if a judge does not voluntarily recuse, another judge will
be assigned to rule on the motion (1 Tex. Admin. Code § 155.152).
Texas Rules of Civil Procedure
Rule 18b(2) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure is central to the recusal
analysis. It mandates that a judge must recuse themselves in any proceeding
where their impartiality might reasonably be questioned, or where they have
a personal bias or prejudice concerning the subject matter or a party
(Pretrial motions (2022-05-05); Kniatt v. State, 239 S.W.3d 910 (Tex. App.
2007)). This standard is objective, focusing on the perception of a
reasonable member of the public, rather than the judge’s subjective intent
(Rogers v. Bradley, 909 S.W.2d 872 (Tex. 1995)).
Federal Due Process Standards
The Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution may also require recusal
even in the absence of actual bias, where the probability of actual bias is
constitutionally intolerable (Pretrial Motions (2021-08-16); Caperton v. A.T.
Massey Coal Co., 556 U.S. 868 (2009)). The U.S. Supreme Court has held
that the appearance of bias or impropriety, particularly when it undermines
public confidence in the judiciary, can itself be grounds for mandatory
recusal.
Case Law
Texas courts have consistently applied an objective standard for recusal,
focusing on whether a reasonable member of the public, knowing all the
facts, would doubt the judge’s impartiality. In Kniatt v. State, 239 S.W.3d 910
(Tex. App. 2007), the court held that recusal is required not only for actual
bias but also when impartiality might reasonably be questioned. The Texas

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Supreme Court in Rogers v. Bradley, 909 S.W.2d 872 (Tex. 1995) emphasized
that the language of Rule 18b is mandatory and objective, not discretionary
or subjective.
Similarly, Sears v. Nueces County Sherriff Olivarez, 28 S.W.3d 611 (Tex. App.
2000) reiterated that recusal is mandatory when there is a reasonable
question as to a judge’s impartiality, and that judges must conduct
themselves in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and
impartiality of the judiciary. Duffey v. State, 428 S.W.3d 319 (Tex. App. 2014)
and Ex Parte Ellis, 275 S.W.3d 109 (Tex. App. 2008) further underscore the
importance of both actual and perceived impartiality, noting that the
perception of impartiality is a defining feature of the judicial role.
Federal authority, as recognized in Texas secondary materials, also supports
this standard. The U.S. Supreme Court in Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co.,
556 U.S. 868 (2009) and Rippo v. Baker, 137 S.Ct. 905 (2017) held that
recusal is required when the probability of actual bias is too high to be
constitutionally tolerable, even if no actual bias is proven (Pretrial Motions
(2021-08-16); Pretrial Motions (2020-08-16)).
Analysis
The Objective Standard for Recusal
The core legal standard for recusal in Texas is whether a reasonable
member of the public, knowing all the facts, would have a reasonable doubt
about the judge’s impartiality (Kniatt v. State, 239 S.W.3d 910 (Tex. App.
2007); Rogers v. Bradley, 909 S.W.2d 872 (Tex. 1995)). This standard is not
limited to actual bias or prejudice, but extends to any conduct that creates
an appearance of impropriety or undermines public confidence in the
judiciary (Sears v. Nueces County Sherriff Olivarez, 28 S.W.3d 611 (Tex. App.
2000); Pretrial Motions (2022-05-05)).
The Texas Constitution reinforces this principle by authorizing removal or
discipline of judges for conduct that is inconsistent with proper judicial
performance or that casts public discredit on the judiciary (Tex. Const. art. 5
§ 1-a). The Texas Code of Judicial Conduct, referenced in Sears v. Nueces
County Sherriff Olivarez, requires judges to observe high standards of
conduct and to act in a manner that promotes public confidence in the
integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.
Application to Judge Evans’s Conduct
The described pattern of Judge Evans’s conduct—ignoring or mishandling
pleadings, failing to address credible allegations of fraud and misconduct,
and issuing orders without legal justification or proper review—constitutes a
cumulative course of action that would likely lead a reasonable member of
the public to question the judge’s impartiality. Texas courts have recognized
that the cumulative effect of judicial actions and omissions can erode public
trust and create an appearance of impropriety, even if no single act rises to

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the level of actual bias (Ex Parte Ellis, 275 S.W.3d 109 (Tex. App. 2008); 
Fuelberg v. State, 410 S.W.3d 498 (Tex. App. 2013)).
The Texas Supreme Court’s decision in Rogers v. Bradley makes clear that
the recusal standard is mandatory and objective. If the facts, as alleged, are
in the public domain and would cause a reasonable person to doubt the
judge’s impartiality, recusal is required. The same principle is echoed in 
Kniatt v. State and Sears v. Nueces County Sherriff Olivarez.
Federal due process standards, as articulated in Caperton v. A.T. Massey
Coal Co. and Rippo v. Baker, further support the necessity of recusal where
the probability of bias is constitutionally intolerable, even absent proof of
actual bias. The Texas courts have incorporated these federal standards into
their recusal jurisprudence (Pretrial Motions (2021-08-16); Pretrial Motions
(2020-08-16)).
The Importance of Public Confidence
The Texas judiciary has repeatedly emphasized that public confidence in the
integrity and impartiality of the courts is essential. The appearance of
impropriety, even without actual bias, can be sufficient to undermine this
confidence and necessitate recusal (Don’t shoot the Canons: maintaining the
appearance of propriety standard. (2005-03-22)). The Texas Code of Judicial
Conduct and the Texas Constitution both require judges to avoid conduct
that would cast public discredit on the judiciary (Tex. Const. art. 5 § 1-a; 
Sears v. Nueces County Sherriff Olivarez).
In In re Inquiry Concerning Honorable Bonnie Rangel CJC No., 677 S.W.3d
918 (Tex. 2023), the Texas Supreme Court addressed a situation where a
judge’s violation of procedural rules and judicial conduct canons led to
public admonishment, reinforcing the principle that even a single instance of
conduct that undermines public confidence can warrant disciplinary action.
Procedural Safeguards
The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and administrative regulations provide
mechanisms for recusal. If a motion for recusal is filed and the judge does
not voluntarily recuse, another judge is assigned to rule on the motion (1
Tex. Admin. Code § 155.152). This procedural safeguard ensures that
allegations of impropriety or loss of public confidence are addressed by an
independent decision-maker.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the standard for recusal is objective and mandatory when impartiality
might reasonably be questioned, Texas courts have also recognized that the
threshold for recusal is high and not every adverse ruling or procedural
error constitutes grounds for recusal (Johnson-Todd v. Morgan, NO.
09-17-00168-CV, NO. 09-17-00194-CV (Tex. App. Dec 20, 2018)). The party
seeking recusal must demonstrate that the judge’s conduct, viewed

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
cumulatively and in context, would cause a reasonable member of the public
to doubt the judge’s impartiality.
Additionally, the recusal process itself is subject to procedural requirements,
and failure to comply with these requirements can affect the outcome of a
recusal motion (In re Inquiry Concerning Honorable Bonnie Rangel CJC No.,
677 S.W.3d 918 (Tex. 2023)). However, where the facts support a reasonable
perception of impropriety or loss of public confidence, recusal is required
regardless of whether actual bias is proven.
Conclusion
Texas law, as reflected in the Constitution, procedural rules, and binding
case law, mandates recusal of a judge not only for actual bias but also when
the judge’s conduct creates an appearance of impropriety or undermines
public confidence in the judiciary. The cumulative pattern of conduct
described—mishandling pleadings, failing to address credible allegations,
and issuing unjustified orders—meets the objective standard for recusal.
Upholding the integrity of the judicial process and maintaining public trust
require that Judge Evans be recused under these circumstances, consistent
with both Texas and federal legal standards.
Legal Authorities

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The Texas Supreme Court mandates that when there exists a reasonable
question as to a judge's impartiality, recusal is mandatory. In determining
whether recusal is required pursuant to Tex.R.Civ.P. 18b(2)(a), the proper
inquiry is whether a reasonable member of the public at large, knowing all
the facts in the public domain would have a reasonable doubt that a judge is
actually impartial. ... Judges, individually and collectively, must respect and
honor the judicial office as a public trust and strive to enhance and maintain
confidence in our legal system. Tex. Code Jud. Conduct, preamble, reprinted
in Tex. Gov't Code Ann., title 2, subt. G, app. B (Vernon 1998 & Supp. 2000).
In this regard, the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct requires that judges
observe high standards of conduct so that the integrity and independence of
the judiciary is preserved; conduct themselves at all times in a manner that
promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.
Summary
The passage highlights the Texas Supreme Court's requirement for recusal
when there is a reasonable question about a judge's impartiality, aligning
with the proposition that recusal is necessary to maintain public confidence
in the judiciary. It also emphasizes the importance of judges upholding the

integrity and independence of the judiciary, which supports the argument
that Judge Evans's actions may have eroded public trust.
Kniatt v. State, 239 S.W.3d 910 (Tex. App. 2007)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Rule 18b(2)(a) plainly states that a 'judge shall recuse himself in any
proceeding in which... his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.'
TEX.R. CIV. P. 18b(2)(a). Texas cases almost unanimously state the following
reasonable-person test for questioned impartiality: 'In determining whether
a judge's impartiality might be reasonably questioned so as to require
recusal, the proper inquiry is whether a reasonable member of the public at
large, knowing all the facts in the public domain concerning the judge and
the case, would have a reasonable doubt that the judge is actually impartial.'
Summary
The passage from "Kniatt v. State" provides a legal standard for when a
judge should recuse themselves due to questioned impartiality. It
emphasizes that recusal is necessary not only for actual bias but also when a
reasonable person might doubt the judge's impartiality. This aligns with the
proposition that recusal is required to maintain public confidence in the
judiciary, especially when there is an appearance of impropriety.
Ludlow v. DeBerry, 959 S.W.2d 265 (Tex. App. 1997)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A judge must also perform his duties without bias or prejudice. TEX.CODE
OF JUDICIAL CONDUCT, Canon 3, pt. B(5) (1994). Ludlow contends that
violation of any of the standards set out in Canon 3 is impartiality per se. ...
Ludlow asserts the recusal hearing was 'tainted by an appearance of
impartiality' because Judge Steib communicated with Judge Chambers
before the recusal hearing regarding whether Judge Chambers would testify.
Summary
The passage highlights the importance of judges performing their duties
without bias or prejudice, as outlined in the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct.
It also discusses a specific instance where a judge's actions (communication
with another judge before a recusal hearing) were perceived as creating an
appearance of impartiality. This supports the proposition that judicial

conduct that creates an appearance of impropriety can undermine public
confidence and necessitate recusal.
Ex Parte Ellis, 275 S.W.3d 109 (Tex. App. 2008)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Litigants have a right to a fair and impartial judiciary. The State of Texas, as
the steward of the judicial system, has the obligation to create such a forum,
to promote public confidence in the courts, and to safeguard the courts from
even the appearance of impartiality or corruption, including political bias or
favoritism. As life and liberty are at issue in a criminal proceeding, a judge's
impartiality—and the parties' perception of that impartiality—is of critical
importance to the parties and society. Indeed, impartiality and the
perception of impartiality are a defining feature of the judicial role. Because
recusal serves to safeguard that role, I dissent to the Court's denial of the
motion for recusal.
Summary
The passage emphasizes the importance of both actual impartiality and the
perception of impartiality in the judiciary. It highlights the obligation of the
State of Texas to maintain public confidence in the courts and to prevent
even the appearance of bias or favoritism. The passage supports the
proposition by underscoring that recusal is necessary not only for actual
bias but also to preserve the integrity of the judicial process and public
trust, aligning with the principles outlined in the proposition.

The rule's language is clear, simple and unequivocal: Texas Rule of Appellate
Procedure 15a provides that an appellate judge 'shall disqualify or recuse
himself in any proceeding in which judges must disqualify themselves under
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18b....' Rule 18b provides in relevant part that
a judge 'shall recuse himself in any proceeding in which ... his impartiality
might reasonably be questioned.' Tex.R.Civ.P. 18b(2)(a). The language is
imperative and mandatory, not permissive or discretionary; the standard is
objective, not subjective. ... Applying this rule, several federal circuit courts
have held that recusal should follow if the reasonable person, aware of all of
the circumstances, would harbor reasonable doubts about the judge's
impartiality.

Summary
The Texas Supreme Court emphasizes the mandatory nature of recusal when
a judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned. The standard is
objective, focusing on whether a reasonable person would doubt the judge's
impartiality. This aligns with the proposition that recusal is necessary to
preserve public confidence in the judiciary when there is an appearance of
impropriety.

Summary
Conditions under which a judge in Texas should recuse themselves,
specifically when their impartiality might reasonably be questioned or when
there is personal bias or prejudice. This aligns with the proposition that
recusal is necessary not only for actual bias but also for the appearance of
impropriety. The passage supports the idea that if a judge's actions create
doubt about their impartiality, recusal is warranted to maintain public
confidence in the judiciary.

(Tex. 2023)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The 'public admonition' arose from a single instance of Judge Rangel filing a
written response to a motion seeking her recusal from a particular case.
Underlying the determination was the rule of procedure stating that a jurist
subject to such a motion 'should not file a response' to it. TEX. R. CIV. PROC.
18a(c)(2). According to the Commission, the mere fact that Judge Rangel
filed a response meant she failed to comport and maintain competence in
the law, thereby violating 'Canons 2A and 3B(2) of the Texas Code of Judicial
Conduct.' ... Furthermore, Article V, Section 1-a(6)(A) of the Texas
Constitution states for what a judge may be disciplined and mandates that a
jurist shall not engage in the willful violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct,
or in willful or persistent conduct that is clearly inconsistent with the proper
performance of her duties or casts public discredit upon the judiciary or on
the administration of justice.
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court has addressed issues of judicial conduct that
undermine public confidence in the judiciary. The passage highlights a
specific instance where a judge's actions were found to violate procedural
rules and judicial conduct canons, leading to public admonishment. This
supports the proposition that judicial actions creating an appearance of
impropriety can necessitate recusal to preserve judicial integrity.

Recusal's Own Conflict of Interest
Criminal Justice - American Bar Association - Louis J. Virelli III -
2025-01-01
Extract
Recusal can be a powerful tool to remedy due process violations based on
partiality, especially in cases where the adjudicator exhibits actual or
probable bias against a party or has a personal conflict of interest. The
Supreme Court has confirmed recusal’s role in these cases but has been
reluctant to apply due process protections too broadly. The Court found due
process violations where a state supreme court justice participated in a case
in which his largest judicial campaign donor was a party, and where a state
supreme court justice took part in the review of a defendant’s death
sentence that the justice had personally approved while serving as the
district attorney responsible for the case. In each instance, the Court cited
the justice’s “probability of actual bias” as grounds for recusal.
Summary
Role of recusal in addressing due process violations due to partiality or
conflict of interest. It highlights instances where the Supreme Court found
due process violations due to probable bias, supporting the idea that recusal
is necessary not only for actual bias but also for the appearance of
impropriety. This aligns with the proposition that recusal is required to
preserve public confidence in the judiciary.

Don't shoot the Canons: maintaining the appearance of propriety standard.

McKeown, M. Margaret - 2005-03-22
Extract
The standard also ensures that, according to the now oft-quoted words,
'justice must satisfy the appearance of justice.' The Court reasoned that the
standard 'may sometimes bar trial by judges who have no actual bias and
who would do their very best to weigh the scales of justice equally between
contending parties.' The Court concluded that eliminating the appearance of
impropriety has its own independent value, engendering public confidence
in the judiciary. ... Public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the
judiciary is undermined when a judge's conduct creates the perception that
a case has been prejudged or that there is a bias against a party, regardless
of whether the perceived bias or prejudice exists.
Summary
The appearance of impropriety in judicial conduct is a significant concern
that can undermine public confidence in the judiciary. The passage
emphasizes that even without actual bias, the perception of bias or
impropriety can necessitate recusal to maintain the integrity of the judicial
process. This aligns with the proposition that recusal is required not only for
actual bias but also for the appearance of impropriety, as it can erode public
trust.

Rule 18b(2) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure sets out the law
concerning recusal and includes instances in which a judge must step down
from hearing a case for reasons other than the disqualifying grounds listed
in the constitution. Rule 18b(2) states, in relevant part, that a 'judge shall
recuse himself in any proceeding in which: (a) his impartiality might
reasonably be questioned; [or] (b)... The Due Process Clause may sometimes
demand recusal even when a judge has no actual bias. Recusal is required
when, objectively speaking, the probability of actual bias on the part of the
judge or decision maker is too high to be constitutionally tolerable. Rippo v.

Summary
Conditions under which a judge in Texas must recuse themselves,
emphasizing that recusal is necessary not only for actual bias but also when
impartiality might reasonably be questioned. This aligns with the proposition
that recusal is required to maintain public confidence in the judiciary, even
in the absence of actual bias. The reference to the Due Process Clause
further supports the necessity of recusal when the probability of bias is
constitutionally intolerable.
