Question
Daniel branthoover
Answer
Assessment of Daniel Branthoover as a Litigant
This assessment analyzes Daniel Branthoover's litigation history based on 18
cases found matching the search criteria. It is important to note that this
analysis is based on a subset of cases and may not fully represent his
complete litigation experience.
Typical Role: Branthoover appears most frequently as a defendant (12 out of
18 cases), often in debt collection, eviction, and family law matters. He has
also been a petitioner in divorce proceedings and a plaintiff in a small claims
case (S07-185J3, DFWBOATS.COM, INC. vs. DANIEL BRANTHOOVER).
Types of Cases: The cases found span various areas:
Evictions (6): These cases frequently involve forcible entry and
detainer actions, suggesting a history of landlord-tenant disputes. (e.g., 
E15-0015J5, Mingzhi Guo c/o ONEprop vs Daniel Branthoover And All
Occupants; E13-0698J5, Aaron Dorn vs Daniel Branthoover and All
Occupants)
Family Law (4): These include divorce proceedings (with and without
children) and protective order cases. (e.g., 2010-61742-393, In the
Matter of the Marriage of Daniel Kenneth Branthoover and Kristine N
Branthoover; 2010-21015-158, In the Matter of Kristine Branthoover
and Kristine Branthoover on Behalf of Traci Starr, Kylie Branthoover &
Jordan Branthoover, The Minor Children And Daniel Branthoover)
Debt/Contract (3): These cases involve disputes with financial
institutions. (e.g., 01-JC-12-00241, Capital One Bank (USA), N.A., vs.
Daniel Branthoover; 2009-20160-158, Wachovia Dealer Services, Inc.,
Plaintiff, v. Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, Defendant.)
Criminal (2): Both are misdemeanor cases in Denton County, Texas,
involving violations of a protective order. (e.g., CR-2010-06730-A, The
State of Texas vs Daniel Kenneth Branthoover; CR-2010-06732-A, The
State of Texas vs Daniel Kenneth Branthoover)
Small Claims (1): In this instance, Branthoover was the plaintiff and
prevailed.
Bankruptcy (1): Filed jointly with Kristine Branthoover (4:05-
bk-46170, Daniel Kenneth Branthoover and Kristine Nicole
Branthoover)
Adult Non-Traffic Citation (1): A guilty plea to tampering with a
government record. (16-01299J5, The State of Texas vs Daniel
Branthoover)
Effectiveness in Motion Practice: Branthoover's motion practice
effectiveness is mixed. He has successfully utilized waivers of service in

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
divorce cases, suggesting a willingness to cooperate in certain contexts.
However, in several cases, particularly evictions and debt collection, he
appears unresponsive, leading to default judgments. In the case against
Charles Myers (5:24-cv-01311, Myers v. Branthoover), he has yet to be
served, and the plaintiff has faced challenges in serving him.
Average Case Duration: The average duration of the analyzed cases is
approximately 8 months, ranging from a few weeks in eviction and small
claims cases to over two years in the criminal cases involving probation.
This is generally longer than typical for straightforward debt collection or
eviction cases, potentially indicating a tendency to prolong proceedings or
difficulty in resolving disputes quickly. However, the family law and criminal
cases fall within more typical timeframes.
Success Rate and Notable Outcomes: Branthoover's success rate is low,
particularly as a defendant. He has prevailed in the small claims case
(S07-185J3, DFWBOATS.COM, INC. vs. DANIEL BRANTHOOVER) and had
divorce cases dismissed (2010-50599-367, In the Matter of the Marriage of
Daniel Kenneth Branthoover and Kristine N Branthoover). However, he has
faced multiple default judgments in debt collection and eviction cases. The
criminal cases resulted in deferred adjudication and probation.
How Most Cases End: A significant number of Branthoover's cases end in
default judgments or with him pleading guilty/nolo contendere. This
suggests a pattern of either unresponsiveness or acceptance of
responsibility. The divorce cases have ended in either agreed decrees or
dismissals.
Most Significant Cases:
CR-2010-06730-A & CR-2010-06732-A (The State of Texas vs
Daniel Kenneth Branthoover): These criminal cases highlight a
history of violating protective orders.
16-01299J5 (The State of Texas vs Daniel Branthoover): The guilty
plea to tampering with a government record raises concerns about
potential dishonesty.
5:24-cv-01311 (Myers v. Branthoover): This ongoing case, with its
high monetary demand and the plaintiff's difficulty in serving
Branthoover, warrants attention.
Attorneys/Law Firms: While several attorneys are listed across the cases, no
consistent pattern of representation emerges, suggesting he does not have a
dedicated legal team.
Expert Witnesses: There is no evidence of Branthoover utilizing expert
witnesses in the cases found.
Additional Insights: The recurring pattern of evictions and debt collection
cases suggests potential financial instability. The protective order and
tampering with a government record cases raise character concerns.

actions are indicated.</p> <p><b>Background:</b> The cause of action in
this case is a violation of a protective order, as indicated by the defendant's
plea of nolo contendere and subsequent deferred adjudication. The factual
background reveals that the defendant, Jim Crouch, was subjected to a
series of legal proceedings starting with an arrest warrant affidavit and
culminating in a plea hearing and probation, with multiple continuances and
hearings leading up to the final disposition on May 16, 2011.</p>
<p><b>Motion practice:</b> The motion practice in this case primarily
involved multiple resets of plea hearings and trial announcements,
indicating a series of delays and continuances, with the motion for
continuance filed on April 1, 2011, leading to a granted continuance. Daniel
Branthoover's performance is not explicitly documented in the docket
entries; however, Jim Crouch appears to be the primary attorney handling
the motions and hearings throughout the case, suggesting that Branthoover
may not have played a prominent role in the motion practice. The case
culminated in a plea of nolo contendere on May 16, 2011, resulting in
deferred adjudication and probation, indicating a resolution after several
procedural delays.</p> <p><b>Duration:</b> The case began on October
14, 2010, when the complaint was filed, and concluded with the discharge
from probation on November 19, 2012. Therefore, the case lasted a total of

court.</p> <p><b>Complexity:</b> The case involves a misdemeanor
charge for violation of a protective order, which was resolved through a plea
of nolo contendere and resulted in deferred adjudication and probation. The
timeline indicates multiple plea hearings, continuances, and procedural
motions, suggesting some complexity in managing court appearances and
legal strategy. Ultimately, the case was disposed of with a discharge from
probation, indicating a resolution without further litigation. Overall, while
there were various procedural steps, the case's resolution suggests it was
not overly complex.</p> <p><b>Experts:</b> There are no entries in the
legal docket indicating the involvement of any experts in the case or that
any experts were hired by Daniel Branthoover. The docket primarily includes
procedural entries related to plea hearings, continuances, and probation
matters.</p> <p><b>Monetary value:</b> The docket pertains to a
criminal case involving a violation of a protective order, resulting in deferred
adjudication and probation for the defendant, Jim Crouch. There are no
monetary damages specified in the entries, as the focus appears to be on
criminal proceedings rather than civil claims for monetary relief. Given the
nature of the charges and typical legal fees associated with such cases, a
rough estimate of the attorney's fees and related costs could range from
$5,000 to $15,000, depending on the complexity and duration of the
proceedings.</p>

Extract
Summary
<p><b>Role:</b> Daniel Branthoover is listed as the Defendant in the
case, while Charles Myers is the Plaintiff. The docket entries indicate that
the Plaintiff has made several motions related to serving the Defendant and
other procedural requests, which highlights the adversarial nature of the
proceedings.</p> <p><b>Status:</b> The case is ongoing and has not yet
been closed, as indicated by the most recent docket entry on 05/30/2025 for
an "Order to Show Cause." Prior entries reveal multiple motions filed by the
plaintiff, Charles Myers, as well as orders denying requests related to those
motions, demonstrating that the court is still actively addressing issues
within the case.</p> <p><b>Background:</b> The cause of action in this
case is based on diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332 for personal
injury. The factual background, as indicated in the complaint filed by Charles
Myers against Daniel Branthoover, includes various exhibits such as
communications, financial documents, and evidence of alleged threats and
influence by the defendant, suggesting a dispute involving personal and
financial harm.</p> <p><b>Motion practice:</b> The case initiated by

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
in advancing the case against Branthoover, who has yet to be officially
served with the complaint. The docket reflects a series of motions focused
on procedural aspects rather than substantive claims, highlighting potential
delays in the litigation process.</p> <p><b>Duration:</b> The case lasted
from December 16, 2024, when the complaint was filed, until May 30, 2025,
when the Order to Show Cause was issued. This indicates a duration of
approximately 5 months and 14 days.</p> <p><b>Outcome:</b> The case
outcome includes multiple denials of the plaintiff Charles Myers' motions,
specifically his requests for service on Daniel Kenneth Branthoover and for
permission to file electronically, as ruled by Judge David L. Russell.
Furthermore, the court granted Myers' motions for leave to proceed in
forma pauperis, allowing him to continue without prepaying fees. The docket
indicates ongoing procedural challenges faced by Myers, culminating in a
final order set for May 30, 2025, that requires Myers to show cause
regarding certain matters in the case.</p> <p><b>Complexity:</b> The
case appears to be moderately complex, involving multiple motions
including requests for service, reconsideration of filing permissions, and a
complaint with numerous exhibits relating to personal injury claims under
diversity jurisdiction. The plaintiff, Charles Myers, has faced procedural
hurdles, such as denied motions for electronic filing and deficiencies in his
application to proceed in forma pauperis. The presence of extensive exhibits
suggests a detailed factual background that may complicate the case
further.</p> <p><b>Experts:</b> There is no indication from the docket
entries that any experts were involved in the case brought by Charles Myers
against Daniel Branthoover. The filings primarily consist of motions
regarding service and permission to file electronically, with the court
denying requests for service on Branthoover, who has yet to be served with
the complaint.</p> <p><b>Monetary value:</b> The case involves a
complaint filed by Charles Myers against Daniel Branthoover, with a
monetary demand of $908,000. The docket entries indicate a focus on
procedural motions, including requests to proceed in forma pauperis and
motions related to electronic filing, which may suggest the plaintiff's
financial constraints. However, the specified demand amount reflects a
significant claim, potentially indicating serious allegations or damages at
stake.</p>

<p><b>Role:</b> Daniel Kenneth Branthoover is listed as the Defendant in
the case, while Mingzhi Guo, representing ONEprop, is the Plaintiff. The
docket entries indicate various procedural actions taken, including citations
issued and returned, but ultimately reflect that Branthoover was the party
being contested in this legal matter.</p> <p><b>Status:</b> The case has

that it has finished and been closed. All docket entries point to procedural
actions taken leading up to the dismissal, with no further activity recorded
after this date.</p> <p><b>Background:</b> The cause of action in this
case appears to be a forcible entry and detainer, as indicated by the
issuance of citations related to this claim. The factual background includes
the plaintiff's original petition filed on December 15, 2014, and subsequent
attempts to serve the defendant, Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, which faced
issues of unservice and a need for alternative service as indicated by the
court's order on December 18, 2014. Ultimately, the case was dismissed for
want of prosecution on December 29, 2014.</p> <p><b>Motion
practice:</b> The motion practice in this case reveals significant procedural
challenges in notifying Defendant Daniel Kenneth Branthoover regarding
the Forcible Entry and Detainer action initiated by Plaintiff Mingzhi Guo.
Multiple citations were issued but returned unserved, leading to an order
for alternative service on December 18, 2014, after the initial citation was

serve the defendant and advance the proceedings effectively.</p>

procedural steps including attempts to serve the defendant, Daniel Kenneth
Branthoover, and multiple resets of court dates. The initial citation was
issued on December 15, 2014, but was unserved and subsequently subject to

hearing dates, the failure to proceed led to the court's dismissal of the
case.</p> <p><b>Complexity:</b> The case appears to be a
straightforward forcible entry and detainer action, as indicated by the filings
related to citations and service attempts. However, it faced significant
procedural delays, including multiple dismissals for want of prosecution and
issues with service of process, suggesting a lack of engagement from the
plaintiff. The absence of substantive legal arguments or complexity in the
complaint points to a relatively simple case that was ultimately dismissed.</

hired by the Defendant, Daniel Kenneth Branthoover. The case faced
significant procedural challenges, including multiple citations issued and
returned unserved, as well as an order for alternative service, ultimately
leading to its dismissal for want of prosecution.</p> <p><b>Monetary
value:</b> The docket entries indicate that this case involved a Forcible
Entry and Detainer, which typically pertains to eviction proceedings. Given

unpaid rent and associated costs, often amounting to a few thousand dollars
at most. However, no specific monetary value is detailed in the docket,

The defendant was served with the citation on September 15, 2010, and
failed to respond adequately by the due date of September 20, 2010.</p>
<p><b>Motion practice:</b> The motion practice in this case involved a
forcible entry and detainer citation served on Daniel Branthoover, resulting
in a judgment for possession in favor of Plaintiff Flagstar Bank FSB on
September 22, 2010, without any monetary damages awarded. The court
proceedings included the issuance of the citation and a subsequent trial
where the judge ruled against Branthoover, leading to the issuance of a writ
of possession. The judgment was formally communicated to both parties,
and the writ was served and returned, indicating the enforcement of the
court's ruling. Branthoover's performance in the motion practice appeared
passive, as he did not contest the judgment or seek any relief following the
ruling against him.</p> <p><b>Duration:</b> The case commenced on
September 13, 2010, with the filing of the Plaintiff's Original Petition and
concluded with the judgment for the Plaintiff being issued on September 22,

action initiated by Flagstar Bank FSB against Daniel Branthoover and all
other occupants, culminating in a judgment for the plaintiff on September
22, 2010, awarding possession of the property but no monetary damages
($0.00). A writ of possession was served on November 15, 2010, and
returned on December 6, 2010, indicating that the bank successfully
regained possession of the property. The case status is marked as disposed
but remains active, suggesting potential ongoing proceedings or related
matters.</p> <p><b>Complexity:</b> The case appears to be a
straightforward eviction action, specifically a forcible entry and detainer
brought by Flagstar Bank FSB against Daniel Branthoover and all other
occupants. The docket entries indicate a quick timeline, with the trial
occurring within a week of the citation issuance, and a judgment rendered
in favor of the plaintiff for possession but with no monetary damages
awarded. The legal proceedings are primarily procedural, suggesting a low
complexity level typical of landlord-tenant disputes.</p>
<p><b>Experts:</b> There is no indication in the docket entries that any
experts were involved in the case. The case primarily revolves around a
judgment for possession awarded to Flagstar Bank FSB against Daniel
Branthoover, with no mention of expert testimony or expert witnesses hired
by either party.</p> <p><b>Monetary value:</b> The case involves a
judgment for possession awarded to Flagstar Bank FSB against Daniel
Branthoover and others, with the monetary judgment explicitly stated as
$0.00. This suggests that the primary focus of the case was not on monetary
damages but rather on regaining possession of the property. Given the
nature of the proceedings, it can be inferred that the case is more significant
in terms of property rights than financial compensation.</p>

Summary
<p><b>Role:</b> Daniel Kenneth Branthoover is listed as a party in the
case, but there is no indication of whether he is the Plaintiff or Defendant

the only other named party, it is reasonable to infer that Daniel Kenneth

However, without additional context or specific designations in the docket,
this remains speculative.</p> <p><b>Status:</b> The case was filed on

Branthoover is listed as a party but lacks any indication of legal counsel or
representation, which suggests he was likely a litigant rather than an
attorney in the matter. The absence of counsel associated with both Daniel
and Kristine Nicole Branthoover further supports this interpretation,
highlighting a potential pro se litigation scenario. Overall, the motion
practice in this case appears to have been minimal, given the limited docket
entries and the straightforward timeline of the case.</p>

<p><b>Outcome:</b> The court ruled in favor of the Plaintiff, Aaron Dorn,
awarding him a judgment of $1,000.00 against Defendant Daniel
Branthoover. The trial was conducted by Judge Mike Bateman on January 6,
2014, and the judgment was subsequently mailed to both parties. The case
has been officially disposed.</p> <p><b>Complexity:</b> The case
involves an eviction proceeding where a judgment was rendered in favor of
the plaintiff, Aaron Dorn, against the defendant, Daniel Branthoover, for
$1,000. The docket entries indicate a straightforward process with a single
trial date, a notice of hearing, and the issuance and service of the forcible
entry and detainer citation. The case was disposed of promptly following the
judgment, suggesting a relatively uncomplicated legal matter.</p>
<p><b>Experts:</b> The docket entries do not indicate the involvement of
any experts in the case, nor is there any mention of experts being hired by
Daniel Branthoover, the Defendant. The proceedings revolve around a
forcible entry and detainer action resulting in a judgment against him in
favor of the Plaintiff, Aaron Dorn, for $1,000. The entries primarily detail
procedural aspects of the case, including the trial date and judgment
issuance, without reference to expert testimony or analysis.</p>
<p><b>Monetary value:</b> The case involved a judgment in favor of the
plaintiff, Aaron Dorn, against the defendant, Daniel Branthoover, with a
monetary award of $1,000.00. This indicates that the case was relatively
small in terms of monetary value, suggesting it may involve a
straightforward dispute, potentially related to rental or property issues
given the context of forcible entry and detainer.</p>

cause of action in this case was initiated by Wachovia Dealer Services Inc.
against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, as reflected in the Plaintiff's Original
Petition filed on May 22, 2009. The factual background includes allegations
that led to the filing of an Application for Writ of Sequestration and

case involved Wachovia Dealer Services Inc. filing a motion for default
judgment against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, which culminated in a final

proceedings and the judgment against him. Additionally, a citation was

=== PAGE 25 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
mailed to him, and despite these notifications, he failed to respond, leading
to the default judgment enforced by the court. Branthoover's lack of
participation was significant, as it directly resulted in the court's ruling in
favor of the plaintiff.</p> <p><b>Duration:</b> The case started on May
22, 2009, when the Plaintiff's Original Petition was filed, and concluded with
the Final Order/Judgment on December 1, 2009. Therefore, the case lasted
approximately 6 months and 10 days from start to finish.</p>
<p><b>Outcome:</b> The case involved Wachovia Dealer Services Inc.
filing a suit against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, culminating in a default
judgment issued on December 1, 2009, due to Branthoover's lack of
response. The court subsequently closed the case with a final order on
December 2, 2009. Notifications of the ruling were sent to the defendant's
attorney, and the case has been marked as inactive and disposed as of
December 16, 2010.</p> <p><b>Complexity:</b> The case appears to be
relatively straightforward, centering around a breach of contract claim by
Wachovia Dealer Services Inc. against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover,
culminating in a default judgment due to Branthoover's lack of response.
The proceedings involved multiple petitions, motions, and affidavits but did
not escalate into complex litigation, as indicated by the issuance of a default
judgment and the absence of extensive discovery or trial proceedings.
Overall, the case seems to reflect a standard debt recovery situation rather
than a complex legal battle.</p> <p><b>Experts:</b> There is no
indication in the docket that any experts were involved in the case, nor is
there any mention of experts being hired by Daniel Kenneth Branthoover,
the Defendant. The docket primarily reflects procedural entries related to
the default judgment issued against him by the court and the actions taken
by the Plaintiff, Wachovia Dealer Services Inc.</p> <p><b>Monetary
value:</b> The docket indicates that a default judgment was issued in favor
of Wachovia Dealer Services Inc. against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, but it
does not specify a monetary amount. The case involved a writ of
sequestration and multiple petitions, suggesting potential financial stakes,
but without specific figures, a rough estimate of the claim could reasonably
be inferred to be in the low to mid five-figure range, typical for cases
involving default judgments and financial services disputes.</p>
