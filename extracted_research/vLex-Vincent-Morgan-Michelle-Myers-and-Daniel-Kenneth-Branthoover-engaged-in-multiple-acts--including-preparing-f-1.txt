Question
Morgan Michelle Myers and Daniel Kenneth Branthoover engaged in
multiple acts, including preparing fraudulent documents, transferring
money across state lines, and lying about indigency, abuse, and harassment
to influence court proceedings. A "pattern of racketeering activity" requires
at least two predicate acts of racketeering activity within a 10-year period.
Predicate acts include mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice (18
U.S.C. § 1961(1)). The preparation of fraudulent documents and the transfer
of funds across state lines for fraudulent purposes could constitute predicate
acts of wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343. Lying to the court about
indigency, abuse, and harassment could constitute obstruction of justice
under 18 U.S.C. § 1503. These acts, taken together, establish a pattern of
racketeering activity.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
The actions of Morgan Michelle Myers and Daniel Kenneth Branthoover that
include preparing fraudulent documents, transferring money across state
lines, and lying about indigency, abuse, and harassment to influence court
proceedings could establish a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO as
they likely constitute wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 and obstruction of
justice under 18 U.S.C. § 1503, both of which qualify as predicate acts under 
18 U.S.C. § 1961(1).
Summary
Under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), a
"pattern of racketeering activity" requires at least two predicate acts of
racketeering activity within a ten-year period. The behaviors described—
preparing fraudulent documents, transferring money across state lines, and
lying to courts about indigency, abuse, and harassment—could satisfy this
requirement by constituting predicate acts under the RICO statute.
Specifically, the preparation of fraudulent documents and interstate transfer
of funds may constitute wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, while making
false statements to the court about indigency, abuse, and harassment could
constitute obstruction of justice under 18 U.S.C. § 1503.
The legal analysis supports the conclusion that these actions, when taken
together, could establish a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO. The
preparation of fraudulent documents and transfer of funds across state lines
likely satisfy the elements of wire fraud by involving a scheme to defraud
using interstate wire communications. Similarly, lying to the court about
matters material to proceedings may constitute obstruction of justice by
endeavoring to impede the due administration of justice. Since both wire
fraud and obstruction of justice are enumerated as predicate acts under 18

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
U.S.C. § 1961(1), and the scenario involves multiple acts that could satisfy
these definitions, the elements required to establish a pattern of
racketeering activity appear to be met.
Background and Relevant Law
Statutory Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), codified at
18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968, was designed as a flexible tool to combat organized
crime Portionpac Chemical Corp. v. Sanitech Systems, 217 F.Supp.2d 1238,
1238 (M.D. Fla. 2002). RICO makes it unlawful, among other things, to
"conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of [an]
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of
unlawful debt." 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c).
Definition of "Racketeering Activity"
Under RICO, "racketeering activity" is defined to include "any act which is
indictable under any of the following provisions of title 18, United States
Code: ... section 1343 (relating to wire fraud), ... section 1503 (relating to
obstruction of justice)." 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). The statute encompasses a wide
range of federal and state crimes, including acts that are "chargeable" under
several generically described state criminal laws, any act "indictable" under
numerous specific federal criminal provisions, including mail and wire fraud,
and any "offense" involving bankruptcy or securities fraud or drug-related
activities that are "punishable" under federal law. Lockhart v. Deluca, No.
23-cv-11488, 2023 WL 5938466 (E.D. Mich. Sept. 13, 2023) ("The
Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, was
enacted to curb 'racketeering activity,' which it defines as any act
'chargeable' under several generically described state criminal laws, any act
'indictable' under numerous specific federal criminal provisions, including
mail and wire fraud, and any 'offense' involving bankruptcy or securities
fraud or drug-related activities that is 'punishable' under federal law.").
Definition of a "Pattern of Racketeering Activity"
A "pattern of racketeering activity" requires at least two acts of racketeering
activity, one of which occurred after the effective date of this chapter and
the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding any period of
imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity. 
18 U.S.C. § 1961(5).
As the Supreme Court has noted, to prove a pattern of racketeering activity,
a plaintiff or prosecutor must show both "relationship" and "continuity"—
that the racketeering predicates are related, and that they either constitute
or threaten long-term criminal activity. Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone
Company, 492 U.S. 229, 229 (1989) ("RICO's legislative history, however,
establishes that Congress intended that to prove a 'pattern of racketeering
activity' a plaintiff or prosecutor must show both 'relationship' and

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
'continuity'—that the racketeering predicates are related, and that they
either constitute or threaten long-term criminal activity.").
The pattern element serves to prevent application of the racketeering
statute to "perpetrators of isolated or sporadic criminal acts." United States
v. Coppola, 671 F.3d 220, 220 (2nd Cir. 2012) ("The pattern element serves
to prevent application of the racketeering statute to 'perpetrators of isolated
or sporadic criminal acts.'").
Wire Fraud as a Predicate Act
Wire fraud is defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1343 as follows:
"Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to
defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent
pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be
transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in
interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or
sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined
under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both." 18 U.S.C. §
1343.
To convict a person of wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, the government
must prove that he "(1) was involved in a scheme to defraud; (2) had an
intent to defraud; and (3) used the wires in furtherance of that scheme." 
3BTech Inc. v. Garelick, 3:21-CV-34 JD (N.D. Ind. Nov 09, 2021).
Obstruction of Justice as a Predicate Act
Obstruction of justice is defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1503, which states in relevant
part:
"Whoever corruptly, or by threats or force, or by any threatening letter or
communication, endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due
administration of justice, shall be punished as provided in subsection (b)." 
18 U.S.C. § 1503.
Under Section 1503, "an act with the natural and probable effect of
interfering with due administration of justice satisfies the intent
requirement for obstruction of justice." Obstruction of justice., ALR Fed.
(Mar. 22, 2008).
A broad variety of actions constitute endeavors for obstruction of justice
purposes. The Eleventh Circuit has held that a false statement need not
actually be used in court or delivered to a court officer to satisfy the
endeavor element; however, such a statement must have the natural and
probable consequence of obstructing the due administration of justice. 
Obstruction of justice., ALR Fed. (Mar. 22, 2005).

Case Law Interpreting RICO and Predicate Acts
The courts have extensively interpreted the requirements for establishing a
pattern of racketeering activity under RICO.
In Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc., 473 U.S. 479, 481-82 (1985), as cited
in Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925, 925 (10th Cir. 1987), the
Supreme Court explained that a violation of section 1962(c) "requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity."
In Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492 U.S. 229, 229 (1989),
the Supreme Court described the pattern concept as "fairly flexible," so that
it can be "demonstrated by reference to a range of different ordering
principles or relationships between predicates."
Similarly, in U.S. v. Licavoli, 725 F.2d 1040, 1040 (6th Cir. 1984), the Sixth
Circuit noted that "The legislative history clearly demonstrates that the
RICO statute was intended to provide new weapons of unprecedented scope
for an assault upon organized crime and its economic roots.... Further,
Congress directed, by Sec. 904(a) of Pub.L. 91-452, 84 Stat. 947: 'The
provisions of this title shall be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial
purposes.'"
In United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 576 (1981), the Supreme Court
further clarified the scope of RICO, though it is worth noting that this case
was later abrogated by Lane v. United States, 474 U.S. 438 (1986) on issues
related to harmless error standards, not on its interpretation of RICO's
substantive provisions.
Multiple courts have emphasized that establishing a RICO violation requires
showing at least two predicate acts within a ten-year period. For instance, in 
P & P MARKETING, INC. v. Ditton, 746 F. Supp. 1354, 1354 (N.D. Ill. 1990),
the court stated that "as a necessary element of any civil RICO claim, a
plaintiff must allege a 'pattern of racketeering activity'... Section 1961(5)
provides: 'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of
racketeering activity, one of which occurred after October 15, 1970 and the
last of which occurred within ten years (excluding any period of
imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity."
The court in 3BTech Inc. v. Garelick, 3:21-CV-34 JD (N.D. Ind. Nov 09, 2021)
also noted that "A pattern of racketeering activity requires two or more
predicate acts of racketeering. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). Racketeering activity
includes a long list of crimes which are defined in 18 U.S.C. 1961(1),
including wire fraud, fraud in connection with access devices, and
interference with commerce by threats or violence."
For predicate acts specifically, courts have clarified that wire fraud requires
a scheme to defraud, intent to defraud, and use of the wires in furtherance
of the scheme. 3BTech Inc. v. Garelick, 3:21-CV-34 JD (N.D. Ind. Nov 09,
2021). Importantly, in Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indem. Co., 553 U.S. 639,
639 (2008), the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff asserting a RICO claim
predicated on mail fraud need not show that it relied on the defendant's

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
alleged misrepresentations, which suggests that the same principle would
apply to wire fraud.
With respect to obstruction of justice, courts have held that a false
statement must have the natural and probable consequence of obstructing
the due administration of justice. Obstruction of justice., ALR Fed. (Mar. 22,
2005). Moreover, "forged letters can constitute an 'endeavor' to influence
the judge, even if not relied upon by the court in its sentencing
determination." Obstruction of justice., ALR Fed. (Mar. 22, 2005).
The Second Circuit in United States v. Coppola, 671 F.3d 220, 220 (2nd Cir.
2012) explained that "at the highest level of generality," both vertical and
horizontal relatedness "can be established simply by connecting diverse
predicate acts to an enterprise 'whose business is racketeering activity,'
such as an organized crime family."
Additionally, Smith v. Aldridge, No. 3:17-cv-01485-HZ (D. Or. Mar 22, 2018)
clarified that "Racketeering activity is defined in § 1961 of the statute, which
provides a list of acts chargeable or indictable under state and federal law. 
18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). The acts chargeable under state law are limited to 'any
act or threat involving murder, kidnapping, gambling, arson, robbery,
bribery, extortion, dealing in obscene matter, or dealing in a controlled
substance or listed chemical... punishable by imprisonment for more than
one year.' Id. The indictable federal acts are wide-ranging and include, for
purposes of this opinion, obstruction of justice under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1503 and
1512."
Administrative Decisions and Secondary Materials
Administrative decisions and secondary materials provide further guidance
on the interpretation of RICO and its predicate acts.
In Blanchard v. Exelis Sys. Corporation/Vectrus Sys. Corp., Case No. 4:16-
cv-00853-ALM (2017), it was noted that "The RICO statute defines
'racketeering activity' to include specified, criminal offences (both federal
and state) known in RICO jurisprudence as 'predicates.' A minimum of two
predicate offences committed within 10 years of each other are necessary to
constitute a 'pattern of racketeering' action in violation of RICO... Obvious
examples of extraterritorial predicate offences included in the definition of
'racketeering activity' under § 1961 include money laundering (§§ 1956-57)
and providing material support to terrorist organizations (§ 2339B), as well
as wire fraud (§ 1343), and securities fraud (§ 1344)."
According to RICO: A Primer (Jan. 31, 2022), "The heart of a RICO case is
the existence of a pattern of racketeering activity. Under the statute,
'racketeering activity' includes a host of offenses... Among other things,
'racketeering activities' include 'any act which is indictable under' a list of
federal criminal statutes... Mail and wire fraud are the most common
predicate acts."
Similarly, Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (Jan. 1, 2024) explains that "A
violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim... In
particular, RICO claims based on mail or wire fraud must comport with
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)'s requirement that allegations involving
fraud be pleaded with particularity."
Analysis
Establishing Wire Fraud as a Predicate Act
Based on the provided legal framework, the preparation of fraudulent
documents and the transfer of funds across state lines for fraudulent
purposes could constitute predicate acts of wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. §
1343.
To establish wire fraud, three elements must be proven: (1) involvement in a
scheme to defraud; (2) intent to defraud; and (3) use of the wires in
furtherance of that scheme. 3BTech Inc. v. Garelick, 3:21-CV-34 JD (N.D. Ind.
Nov 09, 2021).
The preparation of fraudulent documents suggests involvement in a scheme
to defraud. If Morgan Michelle Myers and Daniel Kenneth Branthoover
knowingly prepared documents containing false information with the intent
to deceive others, this would satisfy the first two elements of wire fraud. The
transfer of money across state lines likely involved the use of electronic
means, which would constitute using "wires" in interstate commerce. As
explained in 18 U.S.C. § 1343, the statute applies to anyone who "transmits
or causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television
communication in interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs,
signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or
artifice."
It's worth noting that under Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indem. Co., 553 U.S.
639, 639 (2008), reliance on the fraudulent misrepresentations is not
required to establish mail fraud as a predicate act under RICO, and by
extension, the same principle would apply to wire fraud. This means that
even if no one was actually deceived by the fraudulent documents, the acts
could still constitute wire fraud if the other elements are met.
Establishing Obstruction of Justice as a Predicate Act
Lying to the court about indigency, abuse, and harassment could constitute
obstruction of justice under 18 U.S.C. § 1503, which prohibits acts that
"corruptly... endeavor to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due
administration of justice." 18 U.S.C. § 1503.
As stated in Obstruction of justice., ALR Fed. (Mar. 22, 2008), "Under
Section 1503, an act with the natural and probable effect of interfering with
due administration of justice satisfies the intent requirement for obstruction
of justice." Making false statements to the court about indigency, abuse, and
harassment would likely have the natural and probable effect of interfering

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
with the due administration of justice, particularly if these statements were
made to gain an advantage in court proceedings.
Additionally, Obstruction of justice., ALR Fed. (Mar. 22, 2005) states that "a
false statement need not actually be used in court or delivered to a court
officer to satisfy the endeavor element; however such a statement must have
the natural and probable consequence of obstructing the due administration
of justice." This suggests that even if the false statements about indigency,
abuse, and harassment did not ultimately influence the court's decision, they
could still constitute obstruction of justice if they had the natural and
probable consequence of interfering with the administration of justice.
The same source also notes that "forged letters can constitute an 'endeavor'
to influence the judge, even if not relied upon by the court in its sentencing
determination." Obstruction of justice., ALR Fed. (Mar. 22, 2005). By
analogy, false statements about indigency, abuse, and harassment could
constitute an endeavor to influence the court, regardless of whether they
were ultimately successful.
Establishing a Pattern of Racketeering Activity
To establish a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO, there must be at
least two predicate acts of racketeering activity within a ten-year period. 18
U.S.C. § 1961(5). If the preparation of fraudulent documents, transfer of
funds across state lines, and lying to the court about indigency, abuse, and
harassment can be established as wire fraud and obstruction of justice, they
would constitute predicate acts under RICO.
The requirement of a pattern also includes elements of relationship and
continuity, as established by the Supreme Court in Inc v. Northwestern Bell
Telephone Company, 492 U.S. 229, 229 (1989). The acts must be related and
either constitute or threaten long-term criminal activity. In the present case,
the acts appear to be related as they were all committed with the apparent
purpose of influencing court proceedings. The continuity requirement might
be satisfied if these acts occurred over a sufficient period or threatened
future criminal activity.
As noted in United States v. Coppola, 671 F.3d 220, 220 (2nd Cir. 2012), both
vertical and horizontal relatedness "can be established simply by connecting
diverse predicate acts to an enterprise 'whose business is racketeering
activity.'" If Myers and Branthoover were operating as an enterprise
engaged in fraudulent activities, this would strengthen the case for
establishing a pattern of racketeering activity.
The Enterprise Requirement
It's important to note that a RICO violation also requires the existence of an
"enterprise." 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) makes it unlawful for "any person employed
by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which
affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt."

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The term "enterprise" is defined broadly in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4) as including
"any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity,
and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal
entity," as noted in United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 576 (1981).
If Morgan Michelle Myers and Daniel Kenneth Branthoover were acting
together as an "association in fact," they could satisfy the enterprise
requirement. The Supreme Court in Turkette clarified that the term
"enterprise" encompasses both legitimate and illegitimate enterprises.
Although this interpretation was from a case that was later abrogated by 
Lane v. United States, 474 U.S. 438 (1986), the abrogation related to
harmless error standards and did not affect the interpretation of
"enterprise" under RICO.
Interstate Commerce Requirement
Another requirement for a RICO violation is that the enterprise's activities
affect interstate commerce. 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). The transfer of money
across state lines would likely satisfy this requirement, as it directly involves
interstate commerce.
As noted in Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (Jan. 1, 2024), "It is the activities
of the enterprise, not each predicate act, that must affect interstate or
foreign commerce. RICO requires no more than a slight effect upon
interstate commerce." Given that the scenario involves transferring money
across state lines, this would likely constitute a sufficient effect on interstate
commerce to satisfy this requirement.
Application to Myers and Branthoover's Actions
Based on the facts provided and the legal framework outlined above,
Morgan Michelle Myers and Daniel Kenneth Branthoover's actions could
establish a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO.
First, the preparation of fraudulent documents and transfer of funds across
state lines may constitute wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343. These actions
involve a scheme to defraud, intent to defraud, and the use of interstate
wires.
Second, lying to the court about indigency, abuse, and harassment may
constitute obstruction of justice under 18 U.S.C. § 1503. These actions could
be seen as endeavoring to influence, obstruct, or impede the due
administration of justice.
Since wire fraud and obstruction of justice are both listed as predicate acts
under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), and there are multiple acts that could qualify as
these predicate offenses, Myers and Branthoover's actions could satisfy the
requirement of at least two predicate acts within a ten-year period.
Furthermore, if Myers and Branthoover were acting together, they might be
considered an "enterprise" under RICO. The transfer of money across state
lines would likely satisfy the interstate commerce requirement.

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
In addition, the acts appear to be related as they all pertain to influencing
court proceedings, which would satisfy the relationship requirement. If
these acts occurred over a sufficient period or threatened future criminal
activity, they might also satisfy the continuity requirement.
Exceptions and Caveats
There are several potential exceptions or caveats that could affect whether
Myers and Branthoover's actions establish a pattern of racketeering activity
under RICO.
First, the "pattern" requirement includes elements of relationship and
continuity, which might not be met if the acts were isolated incidents rather
than related activities that constitute or threaten long-term criminal
behavior. As noted in Nutrition Distribution LLC v. Custom Nutraceuticals
LLC, 194 F.Supp.3d 952, 952 (D. Ariz. 2016), a pattern of racketeering
activity must be "related" and "amount to or pose a threat of continued
criminal activity."
Second, to establish wire fraud, it must be shown that the defendants had
the specific intent to defraud. 3BTech Inc. v. Garelick, 3:21-CV-34 JD (N.D.
Ind. Nov 09, 2021). If Myers and Branthoover did not intend to defraud but
were merely mistaken or careless in their actions, this element might not be
satisfied.
Third, for obstruction of justice, the false statements must have the "natural
and probable consequence" of obstructing the due administration of justice. 
Obstruction of justice., ALR Fed. (Mar. 22, 2005). If the false statements
about indigency, abuse, and harassment were not material to the court
proceedings, they might not satisfy this requirement.
Fourth, the RICO statute was primarily designed to combat organized crime
and might not be applicable to all situations involving fraudulent acts. As
noted in U.S. v. Licavoli, 725 F.2d 1040, 1040 (6th Cir. 1984), "The legislative
history clearly demonstrates that the RICO statute was intended to provide
new weapons of unprecedented scope for an assault upon organized crime
and its economic roots." While the statute can be applied beyond traditional
organized crime, courts might be hesitant to apply it to situations that do
not involve substantial criminal activity.
Finally, it's worth noting that Mowett v. Jpmorgan Chase Bank, Case No.
15-12612 (E.D. Mich. Mar 31, 2016), which discusses the requirements for
establishing a RICO violation, was "Stated as Abrogated by Fuller v. Select
Portfolio Servicing, Inc., Case No. 1:19-cv-28 (W.D. Mich. Mar 02, 2021)".
While this abrogation might not directly affect the interpretation of what
constitutes a pattern of racketeering activity, it suggests that the legal
standards for RICO claims continue to evolve, and courts may apply
different standards in different jurisdictions.

Conclusion
Based on the legal framework provided, Morgan Michelle Myers and Daniel
Kenneth Branthoover's actions—including preparing fraudulent documents,
transferring money across state lines, and lying about indigency, abuse, and
harassment to influence court proceedings—could establish a pattern of
racketeering activity under RICO.
The preparation of fraudulent documents and transfer of funds across state
lines may constitute wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, and lying to the
court about indigency, abuse, and harassment may constitute obstruction of
justice under 18 U.S.C. § 1503. Both of these are listed as predicate acts
under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1).
Since there are multiple acts that could qualify as predicate offenses, and
these acts appear to be related and potentially continuous, they might
satisfy the requirement for a pattern of racketeering activity under 18 U.S.C.
§ 1961(5).
Furthermore, if Myers and Branthoover were acting together, they might be
considered an "enterprise" under RICO, and their activities, particularly the
transfer of money across state lines, would likely affect interstate commerce
as required by 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c).
However, there are several caveats to consider, including the need to
establish specific intent to defraud, the materiality of the false statements,
and the evolving standards for RICO claims across different jurisdictions.
Overall, the actions described could potentially establish a pattern of
racketeering activity under RICO, but a definitive determination would
depend on the specific details of the case and the applicable legal standards
in the relevant jurisdiction.
Legal Authorities
P &amp; P MARKETING, INC. v. Ditton, 746 F. Supp. 1354 (N.D. Ill. 1990)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Illinois
Extract
Defendants contend plaintiff failed to adequately allege a pattern of
racketeering activity. As a necessary element of any civil RICO claim, a
plaintiff must allege a 'pattern of racketeering activity'. See 18 USC §
1962(a)-(d); H.G. Gallimore, Inc. v. Abdula, 652 F.Supp. 437, 441 (N.D. Ill.
1987). Section 1961(5) provides: 'pattern of racketeering activity' requires
at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after
October 15, 1970 and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding
any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of
racketeering activity.

Summary
Requirement for establishing a "pattern of racketeering activity" under the
RICO statute, which is directly relevant to the proposition. It specifies that
at least two acts of racketeering activity are needed, aligning with the
proposition's assertion that Myers and Branthoover's actions could
constitute such a pattern. The passage also references the statutory
framework (18 U.S.C. § 1961(5)) that defines this requirement, which is
crucial for supporting the legal argument.
United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246
(1981)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
Chapter 96 of Title 18 of the United States Code, entitled Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO), was added to Title 18 by the
Organized Crime Control Act of 1970. Title 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), which is part
of RICO, makes it unlawful 'for any person employed by or associated with
any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or
foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the
conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering
activity or collection of unlawful debt.' The term 'enterprise' is defined in 18
U.S.C. § 1961(4) as including 'any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity.'
Summary
A pattern of racketeering activity involves a series of criminal acts, which
can include wire fraud and obstruction of justice. This supports the
proposition that the actions of Morgan Michelle Myers and Daniel Kenneth
Branthoover could be considered a pattern of racketeering activity under
RICO.
3BTech Inc. v. Garelick, 3:21-CV-34 JD (N.D. Ind. Nov 09, 2021)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Indiana
Extract
A pattern of racketeering activity requires two or more predicate acts of
racketeering. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). Racketeering activity includes a long list
of crimes which are defined in 18 U.S.C. 1961(1), including wire fraud, fraud
in connection with access devices, and interference with commerce by
threats or violence. ... The Court believes that Plaintiffs have adequately

alleged, at least two, predicate acts of racketeering. “To convict a person [of
wire fraud] under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, the government must prove that he “(1)
was involved in a scheme to defraud; (2) had an intent to defraud; and (3)
used the wires in furtherance of that scheme.”
Summary
Legal framework for understanding how multiple fraudulent acts, such as
those alleged against Morgan Michelle Myers and Daniel Kenneth
Branthoover, could be considered a pattern of racketeering activity if they
involve wire fraud and other predicate acts.

U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
Held: A plaintiff asserting a RICO claim predicated on mail fraud need not
show, either as an element of its claim or as a prerequisite to establishing
proximate causation, that it relied on the defendant's alleged
misrepresentations. ... Using the mail to execute or attempt to execute a
scheme to defraud is indictable as mail fraud, and hence a predicate
racketeering act under RICO, even if no one relied on any
misrepresentation, see Neder v. United States, 527 U.S. 1, 24–25, 119 S.Ct.
1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35; and one can conduct the affairs of a qualifying
enterprise through a pattern of such acts without anyone relying on a
fraudulent misrepresentation.
Summary
For a RICO claim predicated on mail fraud, it is not necessary to prove that
anyone relied on the fraudulent misrepresentations. This supports the
proposition that preparing fraudulent documents and transferring funds
across state lines for fraudulent purposes could constitute predicate acts of
wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, as reliance is not a required element. The
passage also reinforces that such acts can be part of a pattern of
racketeering activity under RICO.
Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893,

Extract
RICO's legislative history, however, establishes that Congress intended that
to prove a 'pattern of racketeering activity' a plaintiff or prosecutor must
show both 'relationship' and 'continuity'—that the racketeering predicates
are related, and that they either constitute or threaten long-term criminal
activity. ... The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO
or Act), Pub.L. 91-452, Title IX, 84 Stat. 941, as amended, 18 U.S.C. §§
1961-1968 (1982 ed. and Supp. V), imposes criminal and civil liability upon
those who engage in certain 'prohibited activities.' Each prohibited activity
is defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1962 to include, as one necessary element, proof
either of 'a pattern of racketeering activity' or of 'collection of an unlawful
debt.' 'Racketeering activity' is defined in RICO to mean 'any act or threat
involving' specified state-law crimes, any 'act' indictable under various
specified federal statutes, and certain federal 'offenses,' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)
(1982 ed., Supp. V); but of the term 'pattern' the statute says only that it
'requires at least two acts of racketeering activity' within a 10-year period,
18 U.S.C. § 1961(5).
Summary
A pattern requires at least two acts of racketeering activity within a 10-year
period, which aligns with the proposition that Myers and Branthoover's
actions could constitute such a pattern if they include acts like wire fraud
and obstruction of justice.
Bankers Trust Co. v. Feldesman, 648 F.Supp. 17 (S.D. N.Y. 1987)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of New York
Extract
A 'pattern of racketeering activity' 'requires' the commission of 'at least two
acts of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). The enumerated acts of
racketeering activity include nine state law felonies and the violation of
more than 25 federal statutes. Id. § 1961(1).
Summary
The definition of a "pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO requires at
least two acts of racketeering activity, which can include violations of federal
statutes such as wire fraud and obstruction of justice. This aligns with the
proposition that the actions of Myers and Branthoover could constitute a
pattern of racketeering activity if they engaged in multiple predicate acts
like wire fraud and obstruction of justice.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The RICO count charged that the four defendants violated 18 U.S.C.A. §
1962(c) by conducting the affairs of the Sheriff's Office through a pattern of
racketeering activity. Engaging in a 'pattern of racketeering activity'
requires at least two acts of racketeering within a ten-year period. Finally,
racketeering activity is expressly defined to include only certain types of
conduct, including acts indictable under 18 U.S.C.A. § 1511. Here, the
Cantrell's game conspiracy (Count III) and the fairgrounds conspiracy
(Count IV) were each alleged to constitute one of the required two acts of
racketeering activity necessary for the substantive RICO violation.
Summary
N example of how different conspiracies can serve as predicate acts for a
RICO violation. This supports the proposition that multiple acts, such as
preparing fraudulent documents and transferring money across state lines,
could constitute a pattern of racketeering activity if they meet the criteria of
predicate acts under RICO.
Sedima v. Imrex Company, Inc, 473 U.S. 479, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346
(1985)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C.
§§ 1961-1968, which is directed at 'racketeering activity'—defined in §
1961(1) to encompass, inter alia, acts 'indictable' under specific federal
criminal provisions, including mail and wire fraud—provides in § 1964(c) for
a private civil action to recover treble damages by any person injured in his
business or property 'by reason of a violation of section 1962.' Section
1962(c) prohibits conducting or participating in the conduct of an enterprise
'through a pattern of racketeering activity.' ... Under the Court's opinion
today, two fraudulent mailings or uses of the wires occurring within 10 years
of each other might constitute a 'pattern of racketeering activity,' § 1961(5),
leading to civil RICO liability.
Summary
The passage explains that RICO targets "racketeering activity," which
includes acts indictable under federal criminal provisions such as mail and
wire fraud. It also clarifies that a "pattern of racketeering activity" requires
at least two acts within a 10-year period. This aligns with the proposition
that the fraudulent activities and misrepresentations by Morgan Michelle
Myers and Daniel Kenneth Branthoover could constitute a pattern of

=== PAGE 15 ===

racketeering activity under RICO, as they involve potential wire fraud and
obstruction of justice.
United States v. Coppola, 671 F.3d 220 (2nd Cir. 2012)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Second Circuit
Extract
The pattern element serves to prevent application of the racketeering
statute to 'perpetrators of isolated or sporadic criminal acts.' United States
v. Payne, 591 F.3d 46, 64 (2d Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).
The Supreme Court, however, has described the pattern concept as 'fairly
flexible,' so that it can be 'demonstrated by reference to a range of different
ordering principles or relationships between predicates.' H.J., Inc. v. Nw.
Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 238–39, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989).
'At the highest level of generality,' both vertical and horizontal relatedness
'can be established simply by connecting diverse predicate acts to an
enterprise 'whose business is racketeering activity,' such as an organized
crime family.'
Summary
The concept of a "pattern of racketeering activity" is flexible and can be
demonstrated by showing a relationship between diverse predicate acts and
an enterprise engaged in racketeering. This supports the proposition that
multiple acts, such as preparing fraudulent documents and transferring
funds for fraudulent purposes, can establish a pattern of racketeering
activity if they are related to an enterprise's activities.
Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc., 741 F.2d 482 (2nd Cir. 1984)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Second Circuit
Extract
Two of the RICO counts allege that the fraudulent purchase orders, invoices
and credit memoranda constitute a pattern of racketeering activity, the
predicate acts being separate and numerous violations of the Mail Fraud
Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341 (1982) and the Wire Fraud Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343
(1982). ... Section 1964(c) states that anyone 'injured' 'by reason of' a
violation of section 1962 is entitled to treble damages. Section 1962
'violations' include conducting 'enterprises' 'through a pattern of
racketeering'; a 'pattern of racketeering' is defined by section 1961(5) as
two or more 'acts of racketeering' occurring within a given time. 'Acts of
racketeering' are defined by section 1961(1), inter alia, as any of a number
of acts 'chargeable under State law,' acts 'indictable' under a variety of
federal laws, or an 'offense' under the federal securities law.

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
A pattern of racketeering activity under RICO requires at least two
predicate acts, which can include wire fraud and obstruction of justice. The
passage confirms that fraudulent activities, such as those alleged against
Myers and Branthoover, can constitute predicate acts under RICO if they
involve violations of federal laws like the Wire Fraud Act. This supports the
proposition that their actions could establish a pattern of racketeering
activity.
Nutrition Distribution LLC v. Custom Nutraceuticals LLC, 194 F.Supp.3d 952
(D. Ariz. 2016)
U.S. District Court — District of Arizona
Extract
RICO makes it unlawful for 'any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in...interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or
participate...in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). 'Racketeering activity' includes
any of several listed crimes 'which is chargeable under State law and
punishable by imprisonment for more than one year,' as well as any act
chargeable under one of several enumerated federal statutes. § 1961(1). A
'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering
activity, § 1961(5), which must be 'related' and 'amount to or pose a threat of
continued criminal activity.'
Summary
These acts must be chargeable under federal statutes listed in § 1961(1).
This directly supports the proposition that the acts of preparing fraudulent
documents and transferring funds across state lines could constitute wire
fraud, and lying to the court could constitute obstruction of justice, both of
which are predicate acts under RICO.

Summary
Requirements for a RICO violation, specifically noting that a pattern of
racketeering activity requires at least two acts of racketeering, which can
include wire fraud. This directly supports the proposition that the actions of
Myers and Branthoover, if they include wire fraud and obstruction of justice,
could constitute a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO.
Lockhart v. Deluca
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Michigan
Extract
The Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, was
enacted to curb “racketeering activity,” which it defines as any act
“chargeable” under several generically described state criminal laws, any
act “indictable” under numerous specific federal criminal provisions,
including mail and wire fraud, and any “offense” involving bankruptcy or
securities fraud or drug-related activities that is “punishable” under federal
law.” 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1); see also Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc., 473
U.S. 479, 481-82 (1985).
Summary
Definition of "racketeering activity" under the RICO Act, which includes acts
indictable under federal criminal provisions such as mail and wire fraud.
This directly supports the proposition that preparing fraudulent documents
and transferring funds across state lines for fraudulent purposes could
constitute predicate acts of wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343. Additionally,
the passage references the broader context of RICO, which is relevant to
establishing a pattern of racketeering activity.

U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Michigan
Extract
To establish a RICO violation under § 1962(c), a plaintiff must allege that the
RICO enterprise engaged in a 'pattern of racketeering activity' consisting of
at least two predicate acts of racketeering activity occurring within a ten-
year period. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). The alleged predicate acts may consist of
offenses 'which are indictable' under any of a number of federal statutes,

including the mail (18 U.S.C. § 1341) and wire fraud statutes (18 U.S.C. §
1343). 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1).
Summary
To establish a RICO violation, there must be a pattern of racketeering
activity, which includes at least two predicate acts within a ten-year period.
The passage specifically mentions wire fraud as a predicate act under 18
U.S.C. § 1343, which aligns with the proposition that preparing fraudulent
documents and transferring funds across state lines could constitute wire
fraud. This supports the idea that such actions could be part of a pattern of
racketeering activity.
Smith v. Aldridge, No. 3:17-cv-01485-HZ (D. Or. Mar 22, 2018)
U.S. District Court — District of Oregon
Extract
In order to state a civil claim for relief under RICO, a plaintiff must show:
'(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity.' Rezner v. Bayerische Hypo-Und Vereinsbank, 630 F.3d 866, 873
(9th Cir.2010) (quoting Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc., 473 U.S. 479, 496,
105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985)). The plaintiff must also show that
'the racketeering activity was both a but-for cause and proximate cause of
his injury' Id. (citing Holmes v. SEC Investor Prot. Corp., 503 US 258, 268
(1992)). ... Racketeering activity is defined in § 1961 of the statute, which
provides a list of acts chargeable or indictable under state and federal law.
18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). The acts chargeable under state law are limited to 'any
act or threat involving murder, kidnapping, gambling, arson, robbery,
bribery, extortion, dealing in obscene matter, or dealing in a controlled
substance or listed chemical. .. punishable by imprisonment for more than
one year.' Id. The indictable federal acts are wide-ranging and include, for
purposes of this opinion, obstruction of justice under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1503 and
1512.
Summary
Obstruction of justice under 18 U.S.C. § 1503 is considered a racketeering
activity. This supports the proposition that lying to the court could constitute
obstruction of justice, which is a predicate act under RICO. Additionally, the
requirement of a pattern of racketeering activity aligns with the
proposition's assertion of multiple acts constituting such a pattern.

U.S. District Court — Middle District of Florida

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Congress designed the Federal Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO), Title 18, United States Code, Section 1961, et
seq. as a flexible tool to fight organized crime. As such, it makes the
following activities unlawful: (a) investing income derived, directly or
indirectly, from a pattern of racketeering activity through collection of an
unlawful debt in any enterprise which affects interstate commerce; (b)
acquiring or maintaining an interest in any enterprise which affects
interstate commerce through a pattern of racketeering activity or through
collection of an unlawful debt; (c) conducting or participating in the affairs
of any enterprise which affects interstate commerce through a pattern of
racketeering activity or collection of an unlawful debt; or (d) conspiring to
violate any of the provisions of Section 1962(a)-(c). 18 U.S.C. § 1962.
'Racketeering activities' covers a wide range of federal and state crimes,
including acts that are 'chargeable' under several generically described
state criminal laws, any act 'indictable' under numerous specific federal
criminal provisions, including mail and wire fraud, and any 'offense'
involving bankruptcy or securities fraud or drug-related activities that [are]
'punishable' under federal law. Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co. Inc., 473 U.S.
479, 482, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985) (quoting 18 U.S.C. §
1961(1)). To engage in a 'pattern of racketeering activity,' the defendant
must have participated in 'at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of
which occurred after the effective date of [RICO] and the last of which
occurred within ten years (excluding any term of imprisonment) after the
commission of a prior act of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5).
Summary
The RICO statute is designed to combat organized crime by making it
unlawful to engage in a pattern of racketeering activity. The statute requires
at least two acts of racketeering activity within a 10-year period, and these
acts can include mail and wire fraud, which are relevant to the proposition.
The passage supports the idea that preparing fraudulent documents and
transferring funds across state lines for fraudulent purposes could
constitute wire fraud, and lying to the court could constitute obstruction of
justice, both of which are predicate acts under RICO.
U.S. v. Licavoli, 725 F.2d 1040 (6th Cir. 1984)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Sixth Circuit

In order to sustain a prosecution under RICO the government must establish
that defendants engaged in a 'pattern of racketeering activity,' defined as at
least two acts of racketeering activity. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1961(5). 'Racketeering
activity' is defined in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1961(1). ... The legislative history clearly
demonstrates that the RICO statute was intended to provide new weapons of

roots.... Further, Congress directed, by Sec. 904(a) of Pub.L. 91-452, 84 Stat.
947: 'The provisions of this title shall be liberally construed to effectuate its
remedial purposes.'
Summary
The RICO statute requires at least two acts of racketeering activity to
establish a pattern. The statute is intended to be liberally construed to
address organized crime effectively. This supports the proposition that the
acts of preparing fraudulent documents, transferring money across state
lines, and lying to the court could be considered predicate acts under RICO,
as they align with the statute's broad interpretation and intent to combat
organized crime.
18 U.S.C. § 1343 18 U.S.C. § 1343 Fraud By Wire, Radio, Or Television
Extract
Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to
defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent
pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be
transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in
interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or
sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined
under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.
Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1343 outlines the federal crime of wire fraud,
which involves devising a scheme to defraud and using wire communications
in interstate or foreign commerce to execute the scheme. This directly
supports the proposition that preparing fraudulent documents and
transferring funds across state lines for fraudulent purposes could
constitute predicate acts of wire fraud. The passage provides the legal basis
for considering such actions as wire fraud, which is a predicate act under
the RICO statute (18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)).

Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1503 addresses actions that corruptly endeavor to influence,
obstruct, or impede the due administration of justice. This statute is relevant
to the proposition because lying to the court about indigency, abuse, and
harassment could be seen as an attempt to obstruct justice. The statute
provides a legal basis for considering such actions as predicate acts of
obstruction of justice, which are necessary to establish a pattern of
racketeering activity under the RICO statute.
18 U.S.C. § 1961 18 U.S.C. § 1961 Definitions

two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective
date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years
(excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act
of racketeering activity;
Summary
The definition of "racketeering activity" includes acts indictable under
sections 1343 (wire fraud) and 1503 (obstruction of justice). The passage
also specifies that a "pattern of racketeering activity" requires at least two
acts within a ten-year period. This directly supports the proposition that the
actions of preparing fraudulent documents, transferring money across state
lines, and lying to the court could constitute a pattern of racketeering
activity if they meet the criteria of wire fraud and obstruction of justice.
18 U.S.C. § 1962 18 U.S.C. § 1962 Prohibited Activities

Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1962 outlines the unlawful nature of engaging
in a pattern of racketeering activity to acquire or maintain control over an
enterprise affecting interstate or foreign commerce. This directly supports

the proposition that the actions of Morgan Michelle Myers and Daniel
Kenneth Branthoover, if they constitute a pattern of racketeering activity,
would be unlawful under this statute. The preparation of fraudulent
documents and transferring money across state lines could be seen as part
of such a pattern, especially if they are intended to influence court
proceedings and affect interstate commerce.
Obstruction of justice.
American Criminal Law Review - Georgetown University Law Center -
Auchincloss, Kalah - 2005-03-22
Extract
A broad variety of actions constitute endeavors for obstruction of justice
purposes. For example, a defendant may be convicted of endeavoring to
obstruct justice even when success is impossible because the object of the
endeavor is an undercover authority. The Eleventh Circuit has held that a
false statement need not actually be used in court or delivered to a court
officer to satisfy the endeavor element; however such a statement must have
the natural and probable consequence of obstructing the due administration
of justice. Similarly, forged letters can constitute an 'endeavor' to influence
the judge, even if not relied upon by the court in its sentencing
determination.
Summary
Obstruction of justice can be established through a variety of actions,
including making false statements or creating forged documents, even if
these actions do not directly influence the court's decision. The passage
supports the proposition by illustrating that lying about indigency, abuse,
and harassment, as well as preparing fraudulent documents, can be
considered endeavors to obstruct justice, which aligns with the predicate
acts required for a pattern of racketeering activity.

2d at 54 (stating that intent is inferred where natural and probable
consequences of defendant's actions is obstruction of justice).
Summary
The passage explains that under Section 1503, the intent requirement for
obstruction of justice is satisfied if an act naturally and probably interferes
with the administration of justice. This aligns with the proposition that lying
to the court about indigency, abuse, and harassment could constitute
obstruction of justice. The cited cases support the idea that intent can be
inferred from the natural consequences of one's actions, which is relevant to
establishing a pattern of racketeering activity.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity.
The practitioner through their pleadings must articulate with great care and
attention a viable racketeering claim. In addition, § 1962(a), (b), and (c) are
limited in scope to conduct involving enterprises engaged in or the activities
of which affect interstate commerce. It is the activities of the enterprise, not
each predicate act, that must affect interstate or foreign commerce. RICO
requires no more than a slight effect upon interstate commerce.
Summary
Essential elements required to establish a RICO violation under § 1962(c),
which includes conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering
activity. It emphasizes the need for at least two predicate acts, such as mail
or wire fraud, and highlights the requirement for these acts to affect
interstate commerce. This directly supports the proposition that the actions
of Morgan Michelle Myers and Daniel Kenneth Branthoover could constitute
a pattern of racketeering activity if they engaged in wire fraud and
obstruction of justice.

Extract
The RICO statute defines 'racketeering activity' to include specified, criminal
offences (both federal and state) known in RICO jurisprudence as
'predicates.' A minimum of two predicate offences committed within 10
years of each other are necessary to constitute a 'pattern of racketeering'
action in violation of RICO... Obvious examples of extraterritorial predicate
offences included in the definition of 'racketeering activity' under § 1961
include money laundering (§§ 1956-57) and providing material support to
terrorist organizations (§ 2339B), as well as wire fraud (§ 1343), and
securities fraud (§ 1344).
Summary
The RICO statute requires at least two predicate offenses within a 10-year
period to establish a pattern of racketeering activity. The passage
specifically mentions wire fraud as a predicate offense under 18 U.S.C. §
1343, which aligns with the proposition that fraudulent document
preparation and interstate money transfers could constitute wire fraud.
Additionally, the passage supports the idea that these acts can be considered
part of a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
The heart of a RICO case is the existence of a pattern of racketeering
activity. Under the statute, 'racketeering activity' includes a host of offenses.
Section 1961 defines the phrase to include any crime listed in subdivisions
A, B, C, D, E, F, or G of section 1961. Among other things, 'racketeering
activities' include 'any act which is indictable under' a list of federal criminal
statutes. The list covers an expansive range of violations, for example,
violations of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. ' 1951 (extortion); 18 U.S.C. ' 1341
(mail fraud) and 1343 (wire fraud); 18 U.S.C. ' 1831 (economic espionage);
18 U.S.C. ' 1832 (theft of trade secrets); 18 U.S.C. ' 1952 (Travel Act); 18
U.S.C. ' 1956, 1957 (money laundering); and 18 U.S.C. ' 2318-2320
(copyright infringement). Mail and wire fraud are the most common
predicate acts.
Summary
A RICO case requires a pattern of racketeering activity, which includes a
variety of offenses such as mail fraud and wire fraud. The passage
specifically mentions that mail and wire fraud are common predicate acts
under RICO, which aligns with the proposition that the preparation of
fraudulent documents and the transfer of funds across state lines for
fraudulent purposes could constitute predicate acts of wire fraud.
Additionally, the passage supports the idea that these acts, when related to
the affairs of an enterprise, can establish a pattern of racketeering activity.

Summary
The RICO statute defines "racketeering activity" to include a wide range of
federal offenses, including wire fraud and obstruction of justice. The
passage specifically mentions that mail and wire fraud are common
predicate acts under RICO. This supports the proposition that the
preparation of fraudulent documents and the transfer of funds across state
lines for fraudulent purposes could constitute predicate acts of wire fraud.
Additionally, the passage supports the idea that lying to the court could be
considered obstruction of justice, another predicate act under RICO.
Important Decisions Regarding Arbitration, Judgment Enforcement And
Sovereign Immunity
Extract
Smagin alleged these actions constituted wire fraud and other RICO
predicate acts such as witness tampering and obstruction of justice. Under
the RICO statute, an individual has a right of action when that individual's
business or property is injured by the violation of a substantive RICO
provision. Successfully pleading and proving RICO claims can be a
challenge, as the plaintiff must show 'conduct of an enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity (known as 'predicate acts') causing injury to
plaintiff's business or property.'
Summary
Legal framework for understanding how these acts could establish a pattern
of racketeering activity.

Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's
Arsenal
Extract
Second, to prove most types of RICO claims, the plaintiff must plead that the
defendant committed some qualifying criminal action, the most common of
which is mail, wire or securities fraud... Third, the plaintiff must plead a
pattern of racketeering activity for most RICO claims. If the alleged conduct
occurred once or twice, or was not continuous, it cannot form a pattern of
conduct sufficient to support a RICO claim.
Summary
For a RICO claim to be valid, there must be qualifying criminal actions such
as mail or wire fraud, and a pattern of racketeering activity must be
established. The passage supports the proposition by highlighting the
necessity of proving predicate acts like wire fraud and establishing a pattern
of racketeering activity, which aligns with the actions described in the
proposition.
