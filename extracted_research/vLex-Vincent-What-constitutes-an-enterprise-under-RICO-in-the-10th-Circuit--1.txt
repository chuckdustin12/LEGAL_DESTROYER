Question
What constitutes an enterprise under RICO in the 10th Circuit?
Answer (Tenth Circuit)
Short response
In the 10th Circuit, a RICO enterprise encompasses "any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity." An
association-in-fact enterprise requires three structural features: a purpose,
relationships among associates, and sufficient longevity to pursue the
enterprise's purpose.
Summary
Under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), an
enterprise in the 10th Circuit follows the statutory definition provided in 18
U.S.C. § 1961(4), which includes formal legal entities as well as informal
associations-in-fact. The 10th Circuit, following Supreme Court guidance in 
Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009), requires that even informal
associations-in-fact must demonstrate three structural features: a purpose,
relationships among those associated with the enterprise, and longevity
sufficient to permit the associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose.
Importantly, while these structural features are necessary, the 10th Circuit
does not require a formal hierarchy, chain of command, or other rigid
organizational elements.
The 10th Circuit has established several key requirements for RICO
enterprises that distinguish them from mere patterns of racketeering
activity. These include the distinctness requirement (the RICO "person" must
be separate from the enterprise), the continuity requirement (associates
must function as a continuing unit), and the requirement that the enterprise
must exist separate from the pattern of racketeering activity. While the 10th
Circuit previously adhered to a more structured approach requiring "a
decision-making framework or mechanism for controlling the group" in 
United States v. Smith, 413 F.3d 1253 (10th Cir. 2005), this rigid
requirement was later overruled, bringing the 10th Circuit's interpretation
in line with the Supreme Court's more flexible approach in Boyle.
Background and Legal Framework
Statutory Definition and RICO Elements
The foundation for understanding what constitutes an enterprise under
RICO begins with the statutory definition. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4), an

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
enterprise "includes any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or
other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity." This definition is consistently cited in 10th
Circuit cases, establishing the broad range of entities that can qualify as
RICO enterprises.
Multiple 10th Circuit cases emphasize that a RICO claim requires proof of
four elements: "(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of
racketeering activity." Robbins v. Wilkie, 300 F.3d 1208, 1210 (10th Cir.
2002) ("To successfully state a RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege four
elements: '(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of
racketeering activity.'"). This formulation comes from the Supreme Court's
decision in Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc., 473 U.S. 479, 496 (1985) and
is consistently applied throughout 10th Circuit jurisprudence, as seen in 
Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d 751, 761 (10th Cir. 2010) and Safe Streets Alliance
v. Hickenlooper, 859 F.3d 865 (10th Cir. 2017).
The statutory basis for RICO liability is found in 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), which
states: "It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with
any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or
foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the
conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering
activity." United States v. Garcia, 793 F.3d 1194, 1200 (10th Cir. 2015)
("Section 1962(c) states: It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or
associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect,
interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.").
Supreme Court Guidance: A Broad Interpretation
The 10th Circuit's understanding of what constitutes a RICO enterprise has
been significantly shaped by Supreme Court decisions, particularly United
States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576 (1981) and Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S.
938 (2009).
In Turkette, the Supreme Court established that a RICO enterprise "is
proved by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by
evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit." U.S. v.
Smith, 413 F.3d 1253, 1266-67 (10th Cir. 2005) ("In United States v.
Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981), the
Supreme Court held that a RICO enterprise 'is proved by evidence of an
ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by evidence that the various
associates function as a continuing unit.'"). The Court also emphasized that
the concepts of an enterprise and a pattern of racketeering activity are
distinct elements, stating that "[w]hile the proof used to establish these
separate elements may in particular cases coalesce, proof of one does not
necessarily establish the other." Id.
Boyle further clarified the requirements for an association-in-fact enterprise,
stating that such an enterprise must have: "(1) a purpose, (2) relationships
among those associated with the enterprise, and (3) longevity sufficient to

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
permit these associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose." United States v.
Kamahele, 748 F.3d 984, 1003 (10th Cir. 2014) ("An association-in-fact
requires: (1) a purpose, (2) relationships among those associated with the
enterprise, and (3) longevity sufficient to permit those associated with the
enterprise to pursue the enterprise's purpose."). Significantly, Boyle rejected
the notion that a RICO enterprise requires a formal hierarchy, chain of
command, fixed roles, a name, established rules, initiation ceremonies, or
regular meetings. Id. at 1003 ("An enterprise may exist even without a
formal hierarchy, chain of command, fixed roles, a name, established rules,
initiation ceremonies, or regular meetings.").
Key Elements of a RICO Enterprise in the
10th Circuit
Three Structural Features Required
Following the Supreme Court's guidance in Boyle, the 10th Circuit has
consistently held that an association-in-fact enterprise must possess three
structural features:
A purpose
Relationships among those associated with the enterprise
Longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the
enterprise's purpose
This three-part test is cited in numerous 10th Circuit cases. For example, in 
Dugan v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., Case No. CIV-17-1221-R (W.D. Okla. Apr.
03, 2018), the court stated: "This 'must have at least three structural
features: a purpose, relationships among those associated with the
enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the
enterprise's purpose.'" Similarly, Sullivan v. HCA Healthcare, Inc., Case No.
19-2034-JAR-TJJ (D. Kan. Aug 26, 2019) quotes Boyle: "From the terms of
RICO, it is apparent that an association-in-fact enterprise must have at least
three structural features: a purpose, relationships among those associated
with the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these associates to
pursue the enterprise's purpose."
The 10th Circuit has further described these requirements by noting that an
association-in-fact enterprise constitutes a "group of persons associated
together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct." United
States v. Kamahele, 748 F.3d 984, 1003 (10th Cir. 2014) ("To qualify as an
enterprise under RICO, the association need only be a 'continuing unit that
functions with a common purpose.'").
Evolution of the "Structure" Requirement
The 10th Circuit's approach to the structure requirement for RICO
enterprises has evolved over time. In United States v. Smith, 413 F.3d 1253
(10th Cir. 2005), the court required: "(1) the existence of a decision-making
framework or mechanism for controlling the group, (2) that various
associates functioned as a continuing unit, and (3) that the enterprise had
1. 
2. 
3. 

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
an existence separate and apart from the pattern of racketeering activity." 
U.S. v. Hutchinson, 573 F.3d 1011 (10th Cir. 2009) ("We held that, to
distinguish the RICO enterprise element from the statute's pattern of
racketeering activity, the government must prove: (1) the existence of a
decision-making framework or mechanism for controlling the group, (2) that
various associates functioned as a continuing unit, and (3) that the
enterprise had an existence separate and apart from the pattern of
racketeering activity.").
However, Smith's requirement for a "decision-making framework or
mechanism" was effectively overruled following the Supreme Court's
decision in Boyle, which rejected the need for a hierarchical structure. As
noted in United States v. Garcia, 793 F.3d 1194 (10th Cir. 2015), Smith has
been overruled in this respect. This shift brought the 10th Circuit's
approach more in line with the Supreme Court's flexible interpretation in 
Boyle.
The current understanding in the 10th Circuit is reflected in Lopez v.
Marriott Int'l, Civil Action 23-cv-03308-RMR-KAS (D. Colo. Feb 27, 2025),
which states: "In Boyle v. United States, the Supreme Court clarified that an
association-in-fact enterprise must have three structural features: 'a
purpose, relationships among those associated with the enterprise, and
longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the enterprise's
purpose.' 556 U.S. 938, 946 (2009). It need not have a hierarchical structure
or chain of command."
Distinctness Requirement
A crucial aspect of what constitutes an enterprise under RICO in the 10th
Circuit is the distinctness requirement, which mandates that the RICO
"person" (defendant) must be separate from the enterprise itself. This
principle is well-established in 10th Circuit jurisprudence.
In Sullivan v. Boettcher & Co., 714 F. Supp. 1132 (D. Colo. 1989), the court
noted: "All of the circuit courts of appeal (except the Eleventh Circuit) that
have considered the issue agree that the RICO 'person' sued as defendant
must be distinct from the RICO 'enterprise.'" The court dismissed the RICO
claim in that case because "the plaintiffs have not alleged an enterprise
separate and apart from the sued defendants." Id.
Similarly, George v. Urban Settlement Servs., 833 F.3d 1242 (10th Cir. 2016)
concluded that the plaintiffs "plausibly allege the existence of an
association-in-fact enterprise distinct from BOA" and therefore "the district
court erred in concluding the plaintiffs failed to adequately plead the
enterprise element of their RICO claim." This again emphasizes the
necessity of distinctness between the RICO person and the enterprise.
Continuous Unit Requirement
Another important aspect of a RICO enterprise in the 10th Circuit is the
requirement that the associates function as a continuous unit. In Carlson v.
Town of Mountain Vill., Civil Action No. 17-cv-02887-PAB-STV (D. Colo. Mar

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
25, 2019), the court stated that an enterprise's existence is proven "by
evidence of an ongoing organization... and by evidence that the various
associates function as a continuing unit." The court further noted that the
enterprise must "function as a continuing unit with an existence beyond that
necessary to commit the predicate acts and have an identity distinct from
that of the individual [d]efendants."
This continuity requirement is also emphasized in Ferluga v. Eickhoff, 408
F.Supp.2d 1153 (D. Kan. 2006), which states that proving a RICO enterprise
requires evidence "that the various associates function as a continuing unit."
Separate Existence from Racketeering Activity
The 10th Circuit also requires that a RICO enterprise must exist separate
and apart from the pattern of racketeering activity. This requirement helps
distinguish between the enterprise element and the pattern of racketeering
activity element.
In Ferluga v. Eickhoff, 408 F.Supp.2d 1153, 1166-67 (D. Kan. 2006), the
court explained that proving an enterprise requires showing that "the
enterprise exists separate and apart from the pattern of racketeering
activity." While it is "not necessary to show that the enterprise has some
function wholly unrelated to the racketeering activity," it must have "an
existence beyond that which is necessary merely to commit each of the acts
charged as predicate racketeering offenses."
This principle is also reflected in United States v. Smith, 413 F.3d 1253,
1266-67 (10th Cir. 2005), which stated that the government must prove "that
the enterprise had an existence separate and apart from the pattern of
racketeering activity." While Smith was overruled regarding its requirement
for a decision-making framework, its holding on the separate existence
requirement remains valid.
Interstate Commerce Requirement
For a RICO enterprise to fall under federal jurisdiction, its activities must
affect interstate or foreign commerce. United States v. DeLeon, No. CR
15-4268 JB (D. N.M. Jan 21, 2020) notes that VICAR "employs a slightly
narrower definition of the term 'enterprise'" requiring that the enterprise "is
engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce."
Similarly, Joseph v. U.S. Pub. Defenders Office states that RICO prohibits
"the use of a pattern of racketeering activity to infiltrate, control, or operate
'a[n] enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect,
interstate or foreign commerce.'" This interstate commerce connection is
essential for federal RICO jurisdiction.

Types of Enterprises in the 10th Circuit
Legal Entities
The 10th Circuit recognizes various legal entities as potential RICO
enterprises, consistent with the statutory definition in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4).
These include:
Corporations: In Mitchell v. Wells Fargo Bank, 355 F.Supp.3d 1136 (D.
Utah 2018), the court affirmed that an "enterprise" includes "any
individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity."
Partnerships and Associations: These formal legal structures are
explicitly included in the statutory definition and recognized by the
10th Circuit.
Government Entities: While not explicitly addressed in the provided
materials, the expansive definition of "enterprise" in the 10th Circuit
would likely include government entities, consistent with broader RICO
jurisprudence.
Associations-in-Fact
Perhaps more complex is the 10th Circuit's treatment of associations-in-fact
as RICO enterprises. These are informal groupings that do not constitute
legal entities but nonetheless can qualify as enterprises under RICO.
In 100 Mount Holly Bypass v. Axos Bank, Case No. 2:20-CV-856-TS-CMR (D.
Utah Jul 27, 2021), the court explained: "Where the alleged enterprise is an
'association-in-fact'—that is, comprised of actors not formally or legally
affiliated with one another—the enterprise must have (1) 'a purpose,' (2)
'relationships among those associated with the enterprise,' and (3) 'longevity
sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose.'"
Dugan v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., Case No. CIV-17-1221-R (W.D. Okla. Apr
03, 2018) further explains that associations-in-fact may exist "even without a
partnership, corporation, or formal association among Defendants." The
court notes that such enterprises need not have "a formal hierarchy, chain of
command, fixed roles, a name, established rules, initiation ceremonies, or
regular meetings."
Proving the Existence of a RICO Enterprise
Evidence Required
The 10th Circuit has provided guidance on what evidence is necessary to
prove the existence of a RICO enterprise. United States v. DeLeon, No. CR
15-4268 JB (D. N.M. Jan 01, 2020) notes that courts generally "liberally
admit evidence of prior bad acts as it is relevant to proving the existence,
organization, and nature of the RICO or VICAR enterprise, and how each
defendant engaged in the pattern of racketeering." This evidence is
1. 
2. 
3. 

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
admitted not "for propensity purposes," but rather to "prove that the
defendant was a member of an enterprise as defined by the meaning of
RICO."
In Carlson v. Town of Mountain Vill., Civil Action No. 17-cv-02887-PAB-STV
(D. Colo. Mar 25, 2019), the court stated that an enterprise's existence is
proven "by evidence of an ongoing organization... and by evidence that the
various associates function as a continuing unit."
Relationship to Organized Crime
Importantly, the 10th Circuit has rejected the notion that a RICO enterprise
must be connected to organized crime. In Plains Resources, Inc. v. Gable,
782 F.2d 883 (10th Cir. 1986), the court disagreed "with the view that, to
state such a RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege and prove that the conduct
described as 'racketeering activity' is connected to criminal conduct of an
organized nature." The court noted that "[n]o language in the statute itself
limits RICO's civil remedies to suits against persons connected with
organized crime," and that Congress deliberately declined to create such a
limitation.
This broad approach is consistent with the Supreme Court's interpretation
and reflects the 10th Circuit's understanding that RICO applies beyond
traditional organized crime contexts.
Pleading Requirements
To adequately plead a RICO enterprise in the 10th Circuit, plaintiffs must
allege facts that establish the structural features required by Boyle. In 
Dugan v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., Case No. CIV-17-1221-R (W.D. Okla. Apr
03, 2018), the court explained that plaintiffs "must plead a plausible
'association-in-fact enterprise'" with "at least three structural features: a
purpose, relationships among those associated with the enterprise, and
longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the enterprise's
purpose."
Failure to adequately plead these elements will result in dismissal of the
RICO claim. For example, in Sullivan v. Boettcher & Co., 714 F. Supp. 1132
(D. Colo. 1989), the court dismissed a RICO claim because "the plaintiffs
have not alleged an enterprise separate and apart from the sued
defendants."
Analysis of Specific Cases
Several 10th Circuit cases provide instructive examples of how the court
applies these principles in practice:
United States v. Kamahele, 748 F.3d 984 (10th Cir. 2014)
This case provides a clear articulation of the requirements for an
association-in-fact enterprise following Boyle. The court emphasized that an

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
enterprise requires "(1) a purpose, (2) relationships among those associated
with the enterprise, and (3) longevity sufficient to permit those associated
with the enterprise to pursue the enterprise's purpose." Id. at 1003. The
court also noted that an enterprise may exist "even without a formal
hierarchy, chain of command, fixed roles, a name, established rules,
initiation ceremonies, or regular meetings." Id.
George v. Urban Settlement Servs., 833 F.3d 1242 (10th
Cir. 2016)
This case addressed the distinctness requirement, with the court concluding
that the plaintiffs "plausibly allege the existence of an association-in-fact
enterprise distinct from BOA." The court found that BOA was "both
sufficiently distinct from the BOA–Urban association-in-fact enterprise and
that BOA conducted the affairs of the enterprise rather than simply its own
affairs." This case illustrates how the 10th Circuit analyzes the distinctness
requirement in practice.
Safe Streets Alliance v. Hickenlooper, 859 F.3d 865 (10th
Cir. 2017)
In this case, the court examined whether marijuana growers constituted an
association-in-fact enterprise under RICO. The court noted that the plaintiffs
alleged "that the Marijuana Growers are each subject to civil liability under
§ 1964(c) for the injuries they have caused to the Reillys' property by
operating their association-in-fact enterprise, which by definition flouts the
CSA, and therefore violates RICO." This case demonstrates how the 10th
Circuit applies RICO to non-traditional contexts.
Exceptions and Limitations
No Requirement for Economic Motive
The 10th Circuit, consistent with Supreme Court precedent, does not
require that a RICO enterprise have an economic motive. As noted in the
secondary material "RICO - the rejection of an economic motive
requirement," the Supreme Court has established a precedent "for a liberal
reading of RICO, and specifically the term 'enterprise,'" which "does not
require an economic motive."
No Connection to Organized Crime Required
As discussed earlier, the 10th Circuit has explicitly rejected the requirement
that a RICO enterprise must be connected to organized crime. Plains
Resources, Inc. v. Gable, 782 F.2d 883 (10th Cir. 1986) establishes that a
RICO plaintiff need not "aver and prove that the conduct described as
racketeering activity be connected to criminal conduct of an organized
nature."

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Illegitimate Enterprises
The 10th Circuit recognizes that purely illegitimate organizations can
constitute RICO enterprises. This follows the Supreme Court's ruling in 
United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576 (1981), which held that "purely
illegitimate groups can constitute RICO enterprises." This interpretation
"breathed new life into RICO by allowing prosecutors to go directly after
organized criminals without awaiting efforts to infiltrate legitimate
businesses."
Conclusion
In the 10th Circuit, a RICO enterprise encompasses a broad range of
entities, consistent with the statutory definition in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4). This
includes formal legal entities like corporations and partnerships, as well as
informal associations-in-fact.
For associations-in-fact, the 10th Circuit follows the Supreme Court's
guidance in Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009), requiring three
structural features: a purpose, relationships among associates, and
sufficient longevity. While the 10th Circuit previously required a more rigid
"decision-making framework or mechanism" in United States v. Smith, 413 F.
3d 1253 (10th Cir. 2005), this approach was overruled following Boyle,
bringing the circuit's interpretation in line with the Supreme Court's more
flexible approach.
The 10th Circuit also maintains several key requirements that help define
what constitutes a RICO enterprise: the enterprise must be distinct from the
RICO "person" (defendant), the associates must function as a continuing
unit, and the enterprise must exist separately from the pattern of
racketeering activity. Additionally, the enterprise must be engaged in or
affect interstate commerce to fall under federal jurisdiction.
Importantly, the 10th Circuit does not require a RICO enterprise to have an
economic motive or a connection to traditional organized crime, consistent
with the broad interpretive approach endorsed by the Supreme Court. This
allows RICO to be applied in various contexts beyond traditional organized
crime scenarios.
In summary, the 10th Circuit's approach to defining a RICO enterprise
balances the need for some structural features with the flexibility intended
by Congress and endorsed by the Supreme Court, resulting in a broad but
not boundless conception of what constitutes an enterprise under RICO.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit

Extract
We conclude these allegations are sufficient to plausibly allege that BOA is
both sufficiently distinct from the BOA–Urban association-in-fact enterprise
and that BOA conducted the affairs of the enterprise rather than simply its
own affairs. Because the plaintiffs plausibly allege the existence of an
association-in-fact enterprise distinct from BOA, we hold that the district
court erred in concluding the plaintiffs failed to adequately plead the
enterprise element of their RICO claim.
Summary
For an entity to be considered an enterprise under RICO in the Tenth
Circuit, it must be distinct from the RICO person. The court found that the
plaintiffs sufficiently alleged an association-in-fact enterprise that was
distinct from BOA, which is crucial for meeting the enterprise element of a
RICO claim. This suggests that an enterprise can be an association-in-fact,
which is a group of individuals or entities associated together for a common
purpose, and it must be distinct from the individual or entity accused of
conducting the enterprise's affairs.
United States v. Garcia, 793 F.3d 1194 (10th Cir. 2015)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
Defendants were charged under RICO, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), with conspiring
to violate 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). Section 1962(c) states: It shall be unlawful for
any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the
activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or
participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.
Summary
Direct reference to the statutory language of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), which
defines an enterprise under RICO as one that is engaged in or affects
interstate or foreign commerce. This is a critical component of RICO
charges, as it establishes the jurisdictional basis for federal involvement.

Summary
Definition of a RICO enterprise as per 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4) and further
clarifies it with the Supreme Court's interpretation in United States v.
Turkette. It explains that a RICO enterprise can be any legal entity or group
of individuals associated in fact, and it must be an ongoing organization
where associates function as a continuing unit. The passage also
distinguishes between the enterprise and the pattern of racketeering
activity, emphasizing that they are separate elements.
United States v. DeLeon, No. CR 15-4268 JB (D. N.M. Jan 21, 2020)

Extract
RICO states that an enterprise 'includes any individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961.
VICAR employs a slightly narrower definition of the term 'enterprise' such
that it 'includes any partnership, corporation, association, or other legal
entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not
a legal entity, which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate
or foreign commerce.' 18 U.S.C. § 1959(b). 'An association-in-fact requires: a
purpose, relationships among those associated with the enterprise, and
longevity sufficient to permit those associated with the enterprise to pursue
the enterprise's purpose.' United States v. Kamahele, 748 F.3d 984, 1003
(10th Cir. 2014).
Summary
Definition of what constitutes an enterprise under RICO and VICAR statutes.
It specifies that an enterprise can be any legal entity or a group of
individuals associated in fact, with the requirement that the enterprise's
activities affect interstate or foreign commerce. The passage also references

Consequently, the Reillys allege that the Marijuana Growers are each
subject to civil liability under § 1964(c) for the injuries they have caused to
the Reillys' property by operating their association-in-fact enterprise, which
by definition flouts the CSA, and therefore violates RICO. See 18 U.S.C. §
1962(c). ... Congress has determined that '[i]t shall be unlawful for any
person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the
activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or
participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity....' 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). ... We have
held that a plaintiff asserting a § 1964(c) claim for a violation of § 1962(c)
'must plausibly allege that' the defendants 'each (1) conducted the affairs (2)
of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.'
Summary
Clear explanation of what constitutes an enterprise under RICO in the Tenth
Circuit. It specifies that an enterprise can be an "association-in-fact" and
that it must be engaged in activities affecting interstate or foreign
commerce. The passage also outlines the elements that must be alleged for
a RICO claim: conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity. This is a general principle applicable to RICO cases in
the Tenth Circuit.
United States v. Deleon, No. CR 15-4268 JB (D. N.M. Jan 01, 2020)
U.S. District Court — District of New Mexico
Extract
The United States notes that it must prove the Defendants were members of
an enterprise to satisfy RICO. See Response at 1-2. The United States
asserts that courts generally 'liberally admit evidence of prior bad acts as it
is relevant to proving the existence, organization, and nature of the RICO or
VICAR enterprise, and how each defendant engaged in the pattern of
racketeering.' ... The United States asserts that it will not introduce the
prior acts 'for propensity purposes,' but rather to 'prove that the defendant

was a member of an enterprise as defined by the meaning of RICO.' J.
Gallegos Response at 1-2 (emphasis in original)(citing United States v.
Kamahele, 748 F.3d at 1007).
Summary
In the Tenth Circuit, proving the existence of a RICO enterprise involves
demonstrating that defendants were members of an enterprise. The courts
in this circuit tend to admit evidence of prior bad acts liberally, as it is
relevant to proving the existence, organization, and nature of the RICO
enterprise. This suggests that the definition of an enterprise under RICO in
the Tenth Circuit includes the organization and pattern of racketeering
activities.
U.S. v. Hutchinson, 573 F.3d 1011 (10th Cir. 2009)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
For our part, in United States v. Smith, 413 F.3d 1253 (10th Cir.2005), we
sided with the Third Circuit and those courts requiring more rather than
less 'structure.' We held that, to distinguish the RICO enterprise element
from the statute's pattern of racketeering activity, the government must
prove: (1) the existence of a decision-making framework or mechanism for
controlling the group, (2) that various associates functioned as a continuing
unit, and (3) that the enterprise had an existence separate and apart from
the pattern of racketeering activity. Id. at 1266-67.
Summary
The passage from "U.S. v. Hutchinson" provides a clear outline of what
constitutes an enterprise under RICO in the Tenth Circuit. It specifies that
the government must demonstrate a decision-making framework, that
associates function as a continuing unit, and that the enterprise exists
separately from the racketeering activity. This aligns with the Tenth Circuit's
precedent in "United States v. Smith," indicating a requirement for more
structure in defining an enterprise.

The term “enterprise” “includes any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity.” 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4) (2006). An

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
association-in-fact requires: (1) a purpose, (2) relationships among those
associated with the enterprise, and (3) longevity sufficient to permit those
associated with the enterprise to pursue the enterprise's purpose. See Boyle
v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 946, 129 S.Ct. 2237, 173 L.Ed.2d 1265
(2009). An enterprise may exist even without a formal hierarchy, chain of
command, fixed roles, a name, established rules, initiation ceremonies, or
regular meetings. Id. at 948, 129 S.Ct. 2237. To qualify as an enterprise
under RICO, the association need only be a “continuing unit that functions
with a common purpose.” Id.; see United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576,
583, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981) (concluding that an association-
in-fact enterprise constitutes a “group of persons associated together for a
common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct”).
Summary
Detailed explanation of what constitutes an enterprise under RICO,
specifically within the Tenth Circuit. It outlines the requirements for an
association-in-fact, which include a purpose, relationships among members,
and sufficient longevity. It also clarifies that a formal structure is not
necessary for an enterprise to exist under RICO.

We disagree with the view that, to state such a RICO claim, a plaintiff must

connected to criminal conduct of an organized nature. We are persuaded by
the opinions which have held that there is no such requirement in a civil

setting. ... No language in the statute itself limits RICO's civil remedies to
suits against persons connected with organized crime, and the legislative
history reveals that Congress declined to create such a limitation, both to
insure that the statute would achieve its purpose, Sutliff, Inc., supra, 727 F.
2d at 654, and because of constitutional problems and vagueness which
Congress thought that requiring a connection of this sort might create. ... In
sum, the language and history of the statute and the guidance from the
Court in Sedima and other courts cause us to reject the requirement that a
RICO plaintiff must aver and prove that the conduct described as
racketeering activity be connected to criminal conduct of an organized
nature.
Summary
The passage from the Plains Resources, Inc. v. Gable case clarifies that
within the Tenth Circuit, a RICO claim does not require the plaintiff to prove
that the racketeering activity is connected to organized crime. This
interpretation aligns with the legislative history and the statute's language,
which do not limit RICO's civil remedies to organized crime. This
understanding is crucial for determining what constitutes an enterprise
under RICO in the Tenth Circuit, as it broadens the scope beyond traditional
organized crime.

U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
A RICO enterprise 'includes any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4). The
existence of an enterprise requires proof (1) of an ongoing organization with
a decision-making framework or mechanism for controlling the group, (2)
that the various associates function as a continuing unit, and (3) that the
enterprise exists separate and apart from the pattern of racketeering
activity. Smith, 413 F.3d at 1266-67. With respect to this last element, 'it is
not necessary to show that the enterprise has some function wholly
unrelated to the racketeering activity, but rather that it has an existence
beyond that which is necessary merely to commit each of the acts charged
as predicate racketeering offenses.' Id. at 1267 (quotation omitted).

circuit courts of appeal (except the Eleventh Circuit) that have considered
the issue agree that the RICO 'person' sued as defendant must be distinct
from the RICO 'enterprise.' ... Plaintiffs impermissibly assert that the
Boettcher defendants and John Does 1 through 10 constitute the RICO
enterprise. Since the plaintiffs have not alleged an enterprise separate and
apart from the sued defendants, their RICO claim must be dismissed.
Summary
The passage from the Sullivan v. Boettcher & Co. case provides insight into
the requirements for establishing a RICO enterprise in the Tenth Circuit. It
emphasizes that the RICO "person" (defendant) must be distinct from the
RICO "enterprise." This distinction is crucial for a valid RICO claim, and
failure to allege an enterprise separate from the defendants results in
dismissal of the claim. This requirement is consistent with the interpretation
of other circuit courts, except the Eleventh Circuit.

isolated acts. As indicated, the district court held that there was a genuine
issue of material fact on the statute of limitations issue. The defendants do
not reassert that matter in this court. The district court also held that there
was no 'pattern' of racketeering activity by the defendants, and on this basis
granted summary judgment.
Summary
Grounds on which the defendants moved for summary judgment, specifically
addressing the absence of an "enterprise" or "racketeering activity" as
defined under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962(c). This indicates that for a RICO claim to
proceed, there must be an identifiable enterprise and a pattern of
racketeering activity, which the court found lacking in this case.

The definition of “enterprise” under RICO is similar to that of a “venture”
under the TVPA: it “includes any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity[.]” 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4) (defining
“enterprise”). In Boyle v. United States, the Supreme Court clarified that an
association-in-fact enterprise must have three structural features: “a
purpose, relationships among those associated with the enterprise, and
longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the enterprise's
purpose.” 556 U.S. 938, 946 (2009). It need not have a hierarchical structure

Summary
Definition of "enterprise" under RICO, which includes various legal entities
and associations-in-fact. The Supreme Court's clarification in Boyle v. United

Extract
Section 1961(4) of RICO defines an enterprise as 'any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' The
Supreme Court has emphasized that 'enterprise' should be read broadly.
Where the alleged enterprise is an 'association-in-fact'—that is, comprised of
actors not formally or legally affiliated with one another—the enterprise
must have (1) 'a purpose,' (2) 'relationships among those associated with the
enterprise,' and (3) 'longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue
the enterprise's purpose.'
Summary
Definition of an enterprise under RICO, as per Section 1961(4), and explains
the broad interpretation endorsed by the Supreme Court. It specifies the
criteria for an "association-in-fact" enterprise, which includes having a
purpose, relationships among associates, and sufficient longevity. This is
relevant to understanding what constitutes an enterprise under RICO in the
10th Circuit, as federal interpretations apply.

Summary
Clear definition of what constitutes an enterprise under RICO in the Tenth
Circuit. It specifies that a RICO claim must allege a violation of 18 U.S.C. §
1962, which includes the element of an "enterprise." This indicates that for a
RICO claim to be valid, there must be conduct of an enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity. The context of the passage is a legal case

U.S. District Court — District of Colorado
Extract
In determining the existence of an 'enterprise' pursuant to COCCA, I may
rely on federal case law construing the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organization Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. § 1961, et seq. (1988) because COCCA
was modeled after the federal act.
Summary
The court may rely on federal case law interpreting RICO to determine the
existence of an "enterprise" under COCCA. Since COCCA was modeled after
RICO, the interpretations of what constitutes an "enterprise" under RICO
are relevant and applicable to COCCA cases. This suggests that the
definition and understanding of an "enterprise" under RICO in the 10th
Circuit can be informed by federal case law.

RICO requires that the enterprise have an economic motive, the Court
defined enterprise as 'an entity,... a group of persons associated together for
a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct,' which does not

require an economic motive. Thus, the Court established precedent for a

Summary
The Supreme Court has established a precedent for a liberal interpretation
of RICO, specifically regarding the term "enterprise." It clarifies that an
enterprise under RICO does not require an economic motive, which suggests
a broad application of the term. This interpretation is significant because it
contrasts with the narrower interpretations that require an economic
motive, as seen in some other circuits.

The Tenth Circuit, although it has traditionally favored 'horizontal

Summary
The Tenth Circuit has traditionally favored the concept of "horizontal
relatedness" when determining what constitutes an enterprise under RICO.
However, it also shows an implicit willingness to accept "vertical
relatedness." This suggests that the Tenth Circuit may consider both
horizontal and vertical relationships between predicate acts when
evaluating the existence of a RICO enterprise.

Summary
General definition of what constitutes an enterprise under RICO, which is
applicable across various jurisdictions, including the Tenth Circuit. It
highlights the broad and inclusive nature of the term "enterprise" under
RICO, allowing for a wide range of entities and associations to be considered
as such. This broad definition is crucial for understanding how RICO can be
applied in different cases.

Extract
RICO enterprises could be proven by simply adducing evidence that
demonstrates a formal or informal association that is ongoing, along with
evidence that those participating in the organization operate as a
'continuing unit.' Yet, there is no enterprise under RICO if the so-called
'enterprise' is merely a name for the crimes that the defendants committed,
or for the defendant's agreement to commit these crimes that was
separately charged from the conspiracy count.
Summary
General understanding of what constitutes a RICO enterprise, emphasizing
the need for a formal or informal association that operates as a continuing
unit. It also clarifies that an enterprise cannot merely be a label for the
crimes committed or an agreement to commit crimes. This understanding is
applicable across various circuits, including the Tenth Circuit, as it reflects a
broader interpretation of RICO enterprises.

The plaintiff must next demonstrate the existence of an 'enterprise.' There is
no requirement that the enterprise be criminal in character; the enterprise
may be a legitimate business, such as a bank or a bank holding company.

Indeed, even the office of state governor has been found to be an enterprise
subject to RICO. Nor must the enterprise be formally organized; it may be
an 'association-in-fact.' The enterprise may be the perpetrator, instrument,
victim or prize of the fraud. The enterprise must be distinguished from the
pattern of racketeering activity. Notwithstanding, the same evidence may be
used to establish both the pattern and the existence of the enterprise.
Summary
Detailed explanation of what constitutes an enterprise under RICO, noting
that it does not need to be criminal, can be a legitimate business, and does
not need to be formally organized. This aligns with the general
understanding of RICO enterprises and is applicable to cases in the 10th
Circuit.

described the elements that the government or a civil plaintiff must prove to
show the existence of an association-in-fact enterprise: '[t]he [enterprise] is
proved by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by
evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit.'
Summary
Criteria for establishing an association-in-fact enterprise under RICO, which
includes evidence of an ongoing organization and that the associates
function as a continuing unit. This is a general principle applicable to RICO
cases, including those in the Tenth Circuit.
Corporate Criminal Liability: End It, Don't Mend It.
The Journal of Corporation Law - University of Iowa Journal of
Corporation Law - Smith, Stephen F. - 2022-06-22
Extract
Subsection 1962(c), the most commonly used basis for substantive RICO
charges, is instructive. It imposes civil and criminal liability on the persons
'employed by or associated with' organized-crime syndicates or other RICO
'enterprises' who 'conduct, or participate in the conduct of, the [enterprise's]
affairs' through a 'pattern of racketeering activity.' (18) Although, as used in
federal law, the term 'persons' can be construed to encompass corporations

and certain other legal entities depending on context, (19) RICO defines
'person' narrowly so as to exclude organized crime syndicates. (20)
Congress thus recognized that the vital objective of eradicating organized
crime could be fully accomplished by taking aim at those who commit the
racketeering activities... (18.) 18 U.S.C. [section] 1962(c); see also id.
[section][section] 1963 (criminal penalties), 1964 (civil penalties). Although
it was originally quite doubtful that purely criminal organizations could
constitute RICO enterprises, the Supreme Court has long endorsed that
expansive interpretation, which breathed new life into RICO by allowing
prosecutors to go directly after organized criminals without awaiting efforts
to infiltrate legitimate businesses. See United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S.
576, 587 (1981) (holding that purely illegitimate groups can constitute RICO
enterprises).
Summary
The passage provides insight into what constitutes an enterprise under
RICO by explaining that RICO applies to persons associated with organized
crime syndicates or other enterprises who conduct the enterprise's affairs
through racketeering. It also clarifies that the Supreme Court has endorsed
an interpretation that allows purely illegitimate groups to be considered
RICO enterprises, as seen in United States v. Turkette. This interpretation is
applicable across federal jurisdictions, including the Tenth Circuit.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
To establish a § 1962(c) RICO claim, the following elements must be proven:
• Enterprise: A structured group of individuals associated for a common
purpose.
Summary
Definition of an "enterprise" under § 1962(c) of the RICO statute, which is
relevant to understanding what constitutes an enterprise in the context of
RICO claims. The definition provided is broad and includes any structured
group of individuals associated for a common purpose. This aligns with the
general understanding of an enterprise under RICO, which can include both
formal legal entities and informal associations. The passage does not specify
any unique interpretation or application specific to the 10th Circuit, but it
provides a foundational understanding that is applicable across jurisdictions.

Additionally, the court pointed out that because the RICO enterprise is not
necessarily the named defendant in a RICO case, 'there is no necessary or,
in many cases, even probable connection between where the RICO
enterprise makes its decisions and whether the application of RICO to the
racketeering activity at issue in a given case was the sort of activity with
which Congress would have been concerned.' Id. Consequently, although the
location of the enterprise - whether identified by its 'nerve center' or
otherwise - may be relevant to determining the territoriality of some RICO
claims, 'its relevance, if any, would depend on the facts.' Id. at *7.
Summary
Concept of a RICO enterprise and its relevance to the territoriality of RICO
claims. It highlights that the RICO enterprise is not necessarily the named
defendant and that the location of the enterprise may be relevant but is fact-
dependent. This suggests that the definition of an enterprise under RICO is
flexible and not strictly tied to the location or the identity of the enterprise,
but rather to the pattern of racketeering activity and its impact.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
A plaintiff is required to demonstrate that the defendant conducted the
affairs of an enterprise though a pattern of racketeering activity. The person
and the enterprise generally must be distinct; but, of course, a Rico person
can be a part of an enterprise.

Under RICO, an enterprise is an entity whose affairs are conducted through
a pattern of racketeering activity. The person and the enterprise must
generally be distinct, although a RICO person can be part of the enterprise.
