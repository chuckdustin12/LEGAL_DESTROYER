Question
I. Introduction Within the last 23 days, four mandamus petitions have been
docketed involving the same parties but identify distinct legal errors made
by the trial courts below. In sum, the respondents include two Associate
Judges, a District Judge, and a Regional Presiding Judge currently presiding
over recusal proceedings. Each of the Respondents, the Real Party, her
counsel, and the Office of the Attorney General were duly notified of all
intentions to initiate these actions, the relief sought, and to date no input
has been provided. The legal errors identified are significant and
multifaceted: (1) an issuance of a void order by rendering a consent
judgment where consent was lacking and in excess statutory authority; (2) a
refusal to hear a properly filed emergency Temporary Restraining Order
(TRO); (3) a swift and improper consolidation of cases without a hearing;
and (4) a failure to adhere to Rule 18a regarding recusal proceedings. These
actions have not only violated procedural norms but have also exacerbated
the legal and personal hardships faced by the petitioner, and consolidation
would serve the interest of judicial efficiency in providing a more wholistic
view of these issues. 2 Amended Statement of Facts Relator, CHARLES
DUSTIN MYERS, is referred to herein as “Father.” Real Party in Interest,
MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS, is referred to herein at “Mother”. Each
record citation marked with (R. X-X) is referencing the concurrently filed
Amended Consolidated Mandamus Record. A. The Precipitating Event and
Background Facts The events giving rise to these proceedings began on
December 12, 2023, when the father discovered a series of text message
exchanges between the mother and two individuals outside the marriage—
identified in the record as Damen Kazlauskas and Debbie Price (R. 253–711).
This discovery occurred shortly after the mother’s abrupt announcement of
her intent to divorce and raised concerns regarding the children’s well-being
and emotional environment. In an effort to address the matter
constructively, the father contacted the mother’s grandfather— who resides
next door to the marital home—via text message to request a family meeting
to discuss the situation (R. 717–720). The following day, however, when
Father confronted Mother with the discovery—presenting his concerns in
the form of data visualizations (R. 255– 257)—she began distancing herself,
starting by redirecting the planned family conversation into a private
meeting solely between herself and her grandparents (R. 1716). On
December 14, 2023, Mother initiated text communication with her 3
stepfather, Dan Branthoover, who resides in Yukon, Oklahoma (R. 274–278).
Mr. Branthoover then contacted Father via text message, stating that he
wanted to help both parties and requested a phone conversation (R. 1703).
That conversation resulted in an arrangement for Mother to travel to Mr.
Branthoover’s residence over the weekend beginning December 15, 2023,
where Mr. Branthoover later acknowledged that he would be assisting with
the divorce paperwork (R. 1710). During this same period, Mother also
sought an ex parte emergency protective order against Father from the
322nd District Court of Tarrant County, as referenced in her divorce petition
(R. 78 at 9B). B. Travel,Influence and Conversion of Marital Assets While en
route to, or upon arrival at, Mr. Branthoover’s residence, Mother withdrew
the entirety of the funds from the joint marital bank account, totaling $1,576

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
(R. 723; 1716–1717). The transaction was facilitated by Mr. Branthoover,
who used his PayPal account—identified as “dmb575” (R. 1707)—as an
intermediary to transfer the funds. This identifier corresponds to the
relevant December 2023 bank statement (R. 1706). Both Mr. Branthoover
and Mother later admitted that the transaction had occurred (R. 1709,
1716). As a result, on December 16, 2023, Father was notified that the joint
account had been overdrawn, which caused the suspension of his business’s
advertising services due to a failed payment (R. 726–727). Father
subsequently contacted Mr. 4 Branthoover in writing to request the return of
the funds, explaining that the money was needed to cover essential family
expenses and to purchase Christmas presents for the children (R. 728–729).
During this exchange, Mr. Branthoover explicitly informed Father that
Mother’s visit was for the purpose of receiving assistance with the
preparation of divorce paperwork (R. 730). C. The Eviction The situation
escalated further on December 17, 2023, when Father was served with an
eviction notice by Mother’s grandmother, Margie Wilson. The notice cited a
protective order and a divorce petition as the basis for eviction, despite
those documents not having been formally filed at the time (R. 735). The
case was later heard by the Honorable Judge Swearingin Jr. and was
dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction (R. 736–737) on January 17,
2024. D. The Divorce Petition On December 18, 2023, Mother formally filed
for divorce (R. 71–81) and requested an “Uncontested Cases” form from the
court (R. 101). In her divorce petition, she claimed that the parties had
stopped living together as spouses on or around December 1, 2023 (R. 74 at
4). She also asserted financial indigence, stating that she had only $21 in
her bank account (R. 91) while being responsible for $1,610 in monthly
expenses (R. 92). Contradicting the timeline established by the eviction
notice served the previous day, the petition further alleged that an 5 active
protective order was already in place against Father, and that a finding of
family violence had been made during the marriage—thereby waiving the
statutory 60-day waiting period (R. 78 at 10). Mother further claimed that
the marital property would be divided by agreement yet designated both
family vehicles as her separate property (R. 79). She requested joint
managing conservatorship (R. 75 at 6D) and sought standard visitation
rights for Father (R. 76 at 6F), while simultaneously alleging that she and
the children could face abuse or serious harm if Father were provided with
her contact information (R. 81 at 15). E. The Protective Order Four days
after filing for divorce, on December 22, 2023, Mother filed an application
for a protective order (R. 103–109). In supporting documents, including an
affidavit (R. 108) and an unsworn declaration, she alleged that family
violence occurred on December 18, 2023—the same day she filed for divorce
(R. 109). However, evidence indicates that on that same day, Mother was
present at the family home with Father, exhibiting no signs of being in a
state of emergency (R. 1692). Mother continued to cohabit with Father
intermittently following these filings, as evidenced by her presence at the
family home on December 29, 2023, participating in a typical evening with
Father and the children (R. 1716). Father 6 was formally served with the
protective order suit on December 27, 2023 (R. 117- 118). Within the
protective order application, Mother requested that Father be prohibited
from approaching within 200 feet of the children’s school, that he cease all
communication with her, and that he complete a battering intervention and
prevention program (R. 105). She acknowledged the joint ownership of the

=== PAGE 3 ===

matrimonial residence but nonetheless requested spousal support, child
support, and Father’s immediate removal from the home (R. 106). Adding
another layer to the situation, the day after the divorce was filed—on
December 19, 2023—Mr. Branthoover contacted Father via text message,
claiming to represent Mother in the legal proceedings (R. 1712). Despite
these filings and allegations, Father continued to cohabit with Mother
leading up to the first scheduled legal proceeding: a show cause hearing set
for January 16, 2024. During this interim period, Father prioritized the
children and spent time with them during their holiday break (R. 826–829).
F.Father Prepares His Defense In response to the series of legal actions
initiated by Mother, Father waited until after the children’s Christmas
holiday to formally begin preparing his defense. He first filed an original
answer to the protective order application, denying all allegations of family
violence (R. 129–133). In his answer, Father raised the 7 affirmative
defenses of fraud, illegality, and duress, asserting that Mother was
attempting to misuse the legal process (R. 131). To support his position,
Father attached two exhibits: the first was a copy of his Texas Department of
Public Safety (TxDPS) record, demonstrating no history of violence (R. 134–
136); the second highlighted inconsistencies within Mother’s divorce
petition (R. 137–140). Subsequently, on January 3, 2024, Father filed a
motion to consolidate the protective order proceedings with the divorce case
(R. 142–145). He also submitted a background report intended to provide
the court with context regarding the children’s familial circumstances (R.
146–148). Father later filed a motion for continuance to obtain legal
representation (R. 149–151), accompanied by additional documentation
related to the family situation (R. 152–155), including text message evidence
from Mr. Branthoover intended to refute Mother’s claim of indigency (R.
161–164). Finally, on January 13, 2024, Father submitted an unsworn
declaration detailing the sequence of events leading up to that point (R.
175–179). G. Setting #1 – Show Cause The first court hearing was scheduled
for January 16, 2024 (R. 117-118). The parties appeared but announced they
were not ready to proceed (R. 180–181). Due to inclement weather
conditions, the Honorable James Munford presided over the matter
temporarily. Judge Munford granted a continuance but also ordered 8 Father
to vacate the family residence effective immediately—without conducting an
evidentiary hearing, making specific findings, or considering Father’s
submitted pleadings. This resulted in a de facto temporary termination of
Father’s custodial rights, and the case was reset for January 22, 2024, to be
heard by the Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer (R. 182–185). Faced with the sudden
loss of his residence and access to his children, Father sought legal
representation immediately and retained attorney Daniel R. Bacalis on
January 19, 2024—just three days before the rescheduled hearing (R. 818 at
9). Father promptly briefed Mr. Bacalis on the situation, providing insights
into the family dynamics through a comprehensive statement of context (R.
168–174). H. Reset #1 – Show Cause On the rescheduled date of January 22,
2024, the parties appeared at the courthouse for the second setting. Mother
initially appeared without legal counsel but retained attorney Cooper L.
Carter in the courthouse lobby just prior to the hearing. This prompted a
further delay, as the Honorable Judge Kaitcer granted a continuance sua
sponte, resetting the case once more to February 1, 2024 (R. 185– 187). In
the period between settings, both Mr. Bacalis, representing Father, and Mr.
Carter, representing Mother, filed amended pleadings in the divorce

proceedings (R. 188-207, R. 208-219). 9 I. Reset #2 – Show Cause At the
third scheduled setting on February 1, 2024, both parties arrived with their
respective counsel and announced they were ready to proceed. 1 However,
instead of the matter being heard by Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer, father’s
counsel, Mr. Bacalis, drafted an “Agreed Associate Judge’s Report” which
was presented to father in the hallway outside the courtroom. (R. 228-234).
This proposed agreement included terms to non-suit (dismiss) the protective
order application, grant father residency in the family home only until
March 1, 2024, and outline the division of financial responsibilities (R.
231-232). Father expressed significant reservations and initially refused to
sign the agreed order, stating his desire to proceed to trial to address
mother's allegations directly and hold her accountable, where he was told by
his counsel, “I know the judge, this is the best we can get,” and felt
pressured into signing the agreement as the only presented option, which is
corroborated by father’s witness in an affidavit (R. 1367-1369). Feeling
frustrated by this outcome, father paid particular attention to the procedural
requirements highlighted in bold text within the agreement signed on
February 1, 2024 (R. 233). The Father then realized that if he terminated his
attorney, he wouldn’t be able to prepare the written order and made the
decision to terminate his counsel and represent himself moving forward. 1
No recorded appearance from either party can be found in the record on
this date. 10 J. Father Proceeds Pro Se Shortly after the court setting, Father
terminated the services of his attorney, Dan Bacalis, and notified the court
(R. 220–222). An agreed motion for withdrawal of counsel was subsequently
filed (R. 223–227). On February 8, 2024, the associate judge’s report dated
February 1, 2024, was filed into the record (R. 228-234). Around the same
time, an agreed order of consolidation was entered—consolidating the
protective order suit with the divorce matter—without Father’s knowledge
or signature (R. 235–238). In response, Father prepared an Emergency
Motion to Vacate, which he filed the following day (R. 239–243). The motion
included a supporting brief summarizing the procedural history and
outlining what Father described as Mother’s unlawful campaign against him
(R. 244–252), and sought a de novo hearing on specific issues. The exhibits
accompanying the motion included text message evidence and data
visualizations involving Mother, Damen Kazlauskas, and Debbie Price,
originally discovered on December 12, 2023 (R. 253–714); text messages
between Father and Mother’s grandfather indicating the divorce was
unexpected (R. 715-720); evidence of marital asset conversion between
Mother and Daniel Branthoover (R. 721–723); documentation of the
overdrawn joint bank account and related communications from
Branthoover (R. 724–731); a copy of the eviction notice served by Margie
Wilson, which Mother later tore in half and marked “VOID” (R. 732-735); 11
and the judgment of dismissal in the eviction proceeding, entered on
January 17, 2024—the day after Father was removed from the residence (R.
736-737). A few days later, the court issued the order granting Attorney
Bacalis’s withdrawal (R. 738–741). Father then prepared and filed a Motion
for Partial Summary Judgment, accompanied by a supporting brief (R. 757–
767). He attached a Proposed Parenting Plan as Exhibit D to the motion (R.
768–772) and a proposed order (R. 773–774). No response was ever
provided to these pleadings by the opposing party. K. Events Preceding the
March 14 Hearing On February 22, 2024, the parties received notice that a
hearing on Father’s Emergency Motion was scheduled for March 14, 2024

signed by Hon. James Munford (R. 775-779). Father subsequently filed a
notice stating his intention to remain in the marital residence due to work
requirements and childcare responsibilities (R. 781–785). He then provided
initial disclosures to the parties (R. 786–792) and received no response to
his emergency motion. Two days later, while Father was taking the children
to school, Mother locked him out of the marital residence and left a sign on
the door declaring that “You should have been out by Saturday you are now
locked out.” (R. 1747–1748). To avoid unnecessary conflict, Father
temporarily stayed in Flower Mound, Texas, with his own father while
awaiting the hearing. 12 L. Setting #4 – Emergency Motion to Vacate and
Reconsider Evidence Father appeared for the scheduled hearing on his
Emergency Motion (R. 793).2 Upon entering the courtroom, he was handed
a document titled “Temporary Orders,” which was a modified version of the
February 1, 2024, agreement previously prepared by Father’s former
counsel (R. 887). These orders were prepared by Cooper L. Carter after the
20-day deadline stipulated in the original agreement. No agreement had
been reached, as evidenced by the parties’ presence in court to contest the
matter, and no motion to sign had been set or filed—contrary to the judge’s
prior directive (R. 233) and agreement of the parties. The proposed orders
also claimed that a hearing had been held on February 1, 2024, for
“Mother’s Motion for Temporary Orders,”3 and that all parties were in
agreement with the terms “as evidenced by the signatures below” (R. 888).
In reality, the February 1 setting resulted only in an associate judge’s report,
drafted informally in the hallway by Father’s prior counsel. Despite this, the
proposed order stated that the court “heard evidence and argument”—a
statement Father asserts was inaccurate (R. 888). At that time, the only
other scheduled hearing was on Mother’s Application for Protective Order,
which had been non-suited in the February 1 Associate Judge’s Report after
two delays. Once the hearing began, Father’s Emergency Motion was denied
without 2 No recorded appearance by the Real Party in Interest, Morgan
Michelle Myers, can be found in the record on this date. 3 This document
has never been served to the Relator. 13 explanation, and he was ordered to
sign the very agreement he had appeared in court to contest (R. 794-795).
Notably, the order itself contained two distinct sets of handwriting, was
prepared by the opposing counsel, and Father refused to sign the document
because he did not agree to its terms (R. 795). Notably, Father also refused
to sign the Temporary Orders claiming his consent (R. 925). No order was
ever issued regarding Father’s Emergency Motion to Vacate. Following the
setting, Father began exploring his appellate remedies and drafted a
Preparatory Notice for Judicial Review, which he later amended twice (R.
797–846). The document provided a detailed account of the parties’ family
background (R. 807), employment history, and household dynamics (R. 808–
815). It included a statement of facts segmented into background facts (R.
816–817), procedural facts (R. 817–821), and undisputed evidentiary facts
(R. 822–825). The pleading also contained video evidence of Father with the
children during the Mother’s initial campaign to have him removed from the
residence (R. 826-829). Appended to the filing were affidavits from Father’s
business clients attesting to his need to remain in the marital residence for
professional reasons pending the divorce (R. 850–852, R. 853–855, R. 856–
858, R. 859–861, R. 862–865, R. 866– 868, R. 869–872). The disputed
Temporary Orders that claimed consent were filed into the record by the
clerk on March 26, 2024. Father promptly responded by filing a formal

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Request for Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law regarding the 14
March 14 decision (R. 882–886).4 He then filed a notice of his intent to seek
mandamus relief by April 8, 2024 (R. 902–905). M. The Appellate
Proceedings In April 2024, Father prepared a Motion for Emergency Relief
directed to the Second Court of Appeals (R. 979–1007) and a Petition for
Writ of Mandamus (R. 931–978). The Petition was accepted by the appellate
court under cause number 02- 24-00149-CV on April 8, 2024, and the trial
court was notified of the filing that same day (R. 1009-1010). Two days later,
Father’s Motion for Emergency Relief and Petition for Writ of Mandamus
were denied per curiam (R. 1011–1012). Father then submitted a Motion for
Rehearing on April 18, 2024 (R. 1028–1044). Six days later, on April 24,
2024, Cooper L. Carter filed a Motion for Pre-Trial Conference (R. 1013–
1016), to which Father promptly objected (R. 1017–1023). The following day,
Father’s Motion for Rehearing was denied by the Second Court of Appeals
(R. 1045). Father moved for en banc reconsideration on April 26, 2024 (R.
1052–1066). On April 30, 2024, although Father continued to disagree with
the Temporary Orders and the hardship they imposed, he abided by the
court’s directives and filed a Notice of Completion regarding the court-
ordered parenting class, which both parties were required to complete by
May 1, 2024 (R. 1046–1050).5 The en banc reconsideration 4 No findings
were ever issued. 5 No notice of completion was ever filed by the Mother. 15
motion was denied the following day (R. 1067). Father then prepared a
second Petition for Writ of Mandamus before this Court, which was accepted
under cause number 24-0395. The trial court was notified of the filing by
postcard (R. 1068–1073). On May 9, 2024, Cooper L. Carter emailed Father
requesting his signature on an Income Withholding Order and claimed that
the orders were agreed (R. 1115). Father reviewed the proposed order,
determined that it was defective (R. 1117–1122), and communicated his
objections to Ms. Carter (R. 1116). N. Intervention From the Texas Attorney
General’s Office Subsequently, an intervention pleading was filed by the
Office of the Attorney General, seeking relief from the trial court regarding
child support obligations (R. 1098–1104). Father objected to this
intervention (R. 1105–1113). Notably, upon examining the pleading
purportedly filed by “Holly Hayes,” Father observed that the signature line
did not match the name of the listed attorney of record. Additionally, the font
sizes in the document appeared inconsistent, suggesting that the signature
may have been irregular (R. 1102). No further correspondence was filed by
the Attorney General’s Office in this matter. By July 2024, during Father’s
designated month for visitation under the disputed orders, he stayed in an
Airbnb near the marital home to maintain stability for the children and
worked with the host to attempt to establish a source of business revenue
(R. 1736–1746). 16 On August 30, 2024, this Court declined to hear Father’s
mandamus petition, and the trial court was notified (R. 1157–1162).
Immediately following the denial, Father prepared a Motion for Rehearing,
which he submitted and later amended in mid-September (R. 1135–1156).
The court was notified of the rehearing filing (R. 1163–1168). O. Challenge
to Opposing Counsel’s Authority Under Rule 12 After filing the Motion for
Rehearing with this Court, Father served discovery requests on the opposing
party, including Requests for Production of Documents (R. 1410–1411) and
Requests for Admissions (R. 1411–1415). In addition, Father filed a motion
under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12, challenging Cooper L. Carter’s
authority to represent Mother in the trial court (R. 1169–1177). This

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
challenge was based on ambiguity surrounding Ms. Carter’s employment
status and the fact that her pleadings were being filed by Roderick D. Marx
—an individual who was not listed as counsel of record and not a party to
the case (R. 219, R. 1016). P.Declining Resources and Exhaustion of
Remedies Facing rapidly declining credit, reduced income (R. 1717–1718),
and limited housing options, Father filed an Emergency Motion for
Temporary Orders on September 24, 2024, requesting relief by October 1,
2024 (R. 1183–1195). When no relief was granted and no response was
received from the opposing party, Father 17 filed a motion seeking the joint
recusal of Judge James Munford and Associate Judge Jeff Kaitcer. The motion
asserted that the nature of Mother’s initial allegations had created an
appearance of bias that could undermine fairness in the proceedings (R.
1196–1220). Q. The First Recusal – Procedural Abnormalities Two days after
the recusal motion was filed, Judge James Munford declined to recuse
himself without explanation and referred the matter to the Honorable David
L. Evans, the 8th Administrative Regional Judge of Fort Worth (R. 1221–
1243). Upon reviewing this referral, Father observed that the version of the
motion submitted to Judge Evans differed significantly from the one he
originally filed. Father’s original filing was a single, 20.21 MB hyperlinked
PDF submitted via the re:SearchTX platform (R. 1253-1254). The version
transmitted to Judge Evans was missing exhibits and the supporting
affidavit. Father notified the court coordinator of the discrepancy and noted
that the file was approximately 18 MB smaller (R. 1254–1255). Receiving no
response, Father filed a formal notice with the court outlining these
procedural irregularities (R. 1245–1252). The following day, Judge Munford
issued an amended order of referral and again declined to recuse, without
explanation (R. 1281–1283). This time, the recusal motion was divided into
three separate files, with the court citing the "size of the motion" as
justification (R. 1356-1357). Father objected to the handling of the recusal
process (R. 1268–1280), noting that the Tarrant County District 18 Clerk’s
publicly available filing guidelines instruct litigants to compile all exhibits
into a single document (R. 1272 at 9). He also noted that his original 20.21
MB file was well within the platform’s approximately 30 MB capacity and
that fragmenting the submission contradicted the court’s standard
electronic filing protocol (R. 1271 at 6–7). R. The First Recusal – the
Appointment of Justice Lee Gabriel Activity paused until October 18, 2024,
when the parties received postcard notification that Father’s Supreme Court
Motion for Rehearing had been denied (R. 1292–1297). Three days later,
Judge David L. Evans issued an order setting a video conference regarding
the recusal motion for October 30, 2024 (R. 1298– 1301). On the day before
the conference, Judge Evans appointed retired Justice Lee Gabriel to preside
over the recusal matter (R. 1305–1308). During the scheduled video
conference, internet connectivity issues arose, and the hearing was
rescheduled to November 7, 2024, to be held in person at the 322nd District
Court. In anticipation of possible objections from opposing counsel—who
had not filed a response to the recusal motion—Father filed a PreTrial
Motion in Limine to prevent unnecessary interruptions during his
presentation and to reiterate key facts of the case (R. 1309-1315). Two days
later, Father submitted a Request for Confirmation of Procedural
Requirements, respectfully asking the district clerk to provide a certified
copy of 19 Justice Gabriel’s oath of office, in an effort to ensure procedural
transparency (R. 1319–1324). S. The First Recusal – Dental Emergency On

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the morning of the rescheduled in-person hearing, November 7, 2024,
Father awoke experiencing significant dental distress, which he promptly
communicated to his father (R. 1391–1392), opposing counsel and the court
coordinator via email (R. 1394), and to Mother directly (R. 1395). Opposing
counsel agreed in writing to reschedule the hearing due to the emergency
(R. 1393). Nonetheless, four days later, on November 11, 2024, the court
coordinator disseminated via email an order signed by Justice Gabriel
denying Father’s recusal motion. The order specifically referenced Father’s
absence from the November 7 hearing but made no mention of the dental
emergency (R. 1397). In response, Father filed a Motion to Enter Judgment
on November 13, 2024, in which he articulated objections to the procedural
irregularities surrounding the recusal proceedings (R. 1325–1369). This
motion was supported by an affidavit elaborating upon those irregularities
(R. 1346–1349). Shortly thereafter, Father filed a Notice of Intent to Remove
the case to federal court, citing exhaustion of state judicial remedies and
setting forth jurisdictional grounds for removal to the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of Texas (R. 1371–1397). 20 On November 18, 2024,
Father also submitted a Motion to Compel Discovery (R. 1398–1407)
pertaining to discovery requests initially served on Mother on September
17, 2024, attached as Exhibit A (R. 1408–1418). He requested that the court
deem the requested admissions conclusively established by operation of law
due to Mother’s failure to respond (R. 1405). The recusal proceedings
concluded when the court formally documented and served the order
denying Father’s recusal motion on November 19, 2024 (R. 1422– 1423). At
that point, the parties awaited formal confirmation of the termination of
Justice Lee Gabriel’s assignment, as such termination would not effectuate
“…until the undersigned Presiding Judge has terminated this assignment in
writing.” (R. 1306.) T. Federal Removal, Remand, and Initiation of
Proceedings Against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover Following the denial of the
recusal motion, Father spent the next two weeks compiling the necessary
record in preparation for federal removal. On December 2, 2024, he filed a
Notice of Removal with the state trial court (R. 1425–1444). Two days later,
however, the United States District Court remanded the matter back to state
court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.6 On December 14, 2024, Dan
Branthoover sent Father a threatening text 6 The Petitioner has not fulfilled
her obligation under Tex. R. Civ. P. 237a by failing to serve a certified copy of
the Order of Remand. 21 message (R. 1719–1720). At that point, Father’s
financial losses had exceeded $75,000 (R. 1460–1462), prompting him to
initiate separate federal litigation against Daniel Branthoover in the U.S.
District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma. That action sought
damages arising from Mr. Branthoover’s involvement in the events
underlying this case, and was later amended (R. 1450–1464). Father
provided notice of the related federal case to the state trial court on
December 31, 2024 (R. 1445–1449). The federal complaint was filed
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a) (R. 1428), and its statement of facts closely
mirrored those presented in the current matter (R. 1452–1455). U. Case
Abandonment The divorce case remained largely inactive until January 16,
2025, when Father submitted a comprehensive Case Memorandum and
served copies upon Judges James Munford and Jeff Kaitcer of the 322nd
Judicial District Court, Visiting Retired Justice Lee Gabriel, Regional Judge
David L. Evans, and opposing counsel Cooper L. Carter (R. 1465–1519). On
January 26, 2025, Father filed a Motion to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution,

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
citing the lack of activity in the case by the opposing party and the Court’s
time standards for divorce proceedings (R. 1526–1533). On January 29,
2025, facing the imminent repossession of his primary vehicle, Father
returned to the matrimonial residence to retrieve his secondary vehicle.
Inside, he discovered numerous personal items that Mother had placed in 22
the vehicle. He temporarily relocated these items to the porch (R. 1628–
1629). Upon returning the next day to collect the children for his scheduled
possession, Father observed that Mother had moved the items from the
porch to the curb (R. 1630-1631). No further docket activity occurred until
February 25, 2025, when Father filed a Notice of Loss of Employment,
notifying the court of a significant reduction in income (R. 1520–1525). At
the same time, he submitted a Motion to Sign, requesting a ruling on his
long-pending Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, which had remained
unresolved since its original filing on February 22, 2024 (R. 1636–1656), and
which the court acknowledged during the March 14, 2024, hearing (R.
1369). Father also filed an Objection and Request for Judicial Notice,
recapping relevant procedural history and identifying pending matters
requiring rulings (R. 1660–1677). On February 28, 2025, Father filed a
Request for Ruling on his outstanding motions (R. 1678–1685). On March 5,
2025, he submitted a Notice of New Information, documenting Watauga
Police Department involvement regarding his personal property being
placed at the curb by Mother (R. 1686–1695). On March 12, 2025, Father
filed a Notice of Continued Obstruction, itemizing pending, unopposed
motions and emphasizing the ongoing lack of response from opposing
counsel (R. 1929–1942). He reinforced these concerns on March 14, 2025,
through 23 a Notice of Submission, restating the uncontested factual
background and the judicial inaction on multiple unresolved filings (R. 1943–
1955). By March 18, 2025, Father contacted the court coordinator via email,
highlighting that neither Judge Munford nor Judge Kaitcer had been
formally reinstated to preside over the case, despite Justice Gabriel’s denial
of recusal being entered nearly four months earlier (R. 1506-1507). In light
of the continued judicial inactivity, and being confident in his understanding
of dominant jurisdiction based on the extensive record, Father initiated a
new Original Suit Affecting the Parent- Child Relationship (SAPCR) in the
233rd District Court of Tarrant County, submitting a cover letter explaining
his need for immediate relief for himself and his minor children (R. 2259–
2277). V. The SAPCR Suit and the Sudden Reappearance of Counsel On
March 18, 2025, the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County accepted
Father’s original SAPCR petition (R. 2053–2064). Shortly thereafter, Mother
reappeared in the litigation after several months of inactivity and filed a
general denial in response to the SAPCR petition (R. 2278–2282). This
pleading was submitted on behalf of Cooper L. Carter by Roderick D. Marx
(R. 2282). Mr. Marx subsequently filed a motion to consolidate the SAPCR
matter back into the original divorce case in the 322nd District Court (R.
2283–2286), again purporting to act on Ms. Carter’s behalf (R. 2286). Father
moved to strike both the general denial and the motion to consolidate 24 (R.
1956–1965), and attached an exhibit showing that opposing counsel was
registered under a different law firm than what appeared on her pleadings.
(R. 1962–1963). Father also filed a second Rule 12 Motion challenging
Cooper L. Carter’s authority to represent Mother in the 233rd District
Court, citing Ms. Carter’s continued failure to formally appear and the
repeated filings by Mr. Marx in her name (R. 2287–2300). As of the date of

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
this filing, no response has been submitted to any of these pleadings by Ms.
Carter. W. The Emergency TRO On March 24, 2025, Father filed an
Objection to Consolidation in the second-filed case (R. 1880–1888) and an
Emergency Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), seeking to
prevent Mother from restricting his access to the family residence and to
safeguard the children (R. 2301–2326). The TRO incorporated the same
statement of facts that remains unopposed in multiple pleadings (R. 2304–
2312). Father then coordinated with court staff to schedule the presentation
of his emergency motion and documented all communications (R. 2333–
2365) regarding these interactions. In those communications, Father first
inquired about the status of his request and informed the court that the
opposing party had been notified of the substance of the relief sought (R.
2338). The clerk advised that in-person presentation was required, and
Father requested to appear between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. on March 28, 2025,
again confirming that the opposing party had been served (R. 2339). Father
25 delivered the intended materials to opposing counsel in advance of that
presentation (R. 2351), and the clerk confirmed the scheduled time (R. 2339-
2340). On March 28, 2025, Father appeared before the court coordinator,
who assisted in securing opposing counsel’s agreement to set the TRO
hearing for April 10, 2025, from the available dates provided (R. 2358). The
coordinator initialed the scheduling notice to reflect that agreement (R.
2360-2361). Father then proceeded to present the motion to the Honorable
Kate Stone, who summarily declined to even hear it based solely on a
prospective objection communicated by Mother’s counsel—who was not
even present in court (R. 2352). Even the coordinator acknowledged that the
motion could have been heard on the spot, and noted that it could have been
transferred after the emergency was addressed (R. 2356). Instead, the
Associate Judge declined entirely to entertain the motion, ultimately
triggering cause number 25-0367, now pending before this Honorable
Court. On April 1, 2025, Father filed a Pre-Objection in the 322nd court
addressing opposing counsel’s anticipated motion to consolidate (R. 1889–
1915). He also submitted a Respondent’s Statement in the 322nd District
Court (R. 1916–1919) and a separate Petitioner’s Statement in the 233rd
District Court (R. 1920–1928). Father then filed a Petitioner’s Notice in the
233rd, presenting a side-by-side analysis of the children’s best interests and
relevant procedural considerations (R. 1995–2004). 26 On April 3, 2025,
Roderick Marx filed the Motion to Consolidate on behalf of Mother’s counsel
that had been used to block the emergency hearing in the 322nd District
Court, which failed to acknowledge Father’s prior objection (R. 2366–2369).
In response, Father filed a Pre-Objection to Transfer in the 233rd District
Court (R. 2084–2087) realizing that the case would need to be transferred at
some point along with a Notice of New Information advising the court that
Mother was now engaged to Damen Kazlauskas—the individual with whom
she exchanged extensive messages at the outset of this case (R. 2019–2024).
Father also submitted a Comprehensive Legal Analysis in Support of
Dismissal in the 322nd District Court, setting forth grounds to dismiss the
original divorce matter so that the SAPCR could proceed independently (R.
1975–1994). X. The Dragon in Triplicate A few days later, Father filed a
Notice of Intent to File Mandamus in the 233rd District Court (R. 2065–
2083) and a Notice of Intent to File Prohibition in the 322nd District Court
(R. 2005–2018). On April 10, 2025, Father filed an Emergency Motion for
Declaratory Relief (R. 1775–1786) and a Petition for Writ of Mandamus in

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the Second Court of Appeals, naming the Honorable Kate Stone as
Respondent under cause number 02-25-00164-CV (“the SAPCR Mandamus”)
(R. 2025–2052). Directly after this mandamus was submitted to the Second
Court of Appeals, District Judge Kenneth Newell from the 233rd District
Court sua sponte granted Mother’s Motion to Consolidate in the 233rd
District Court and then filed it 27 with the 322nd District Court. (R.
2392-2395). The following day, the first-filed petition (“the SAPCR
mandamus”) was denied per curiam in the Second Court of Appeals. On
April 15, 2025, Father filed a Dominant Jurisdiction Analysis in the 322nd
District Court (R. 2088–2100), along with a second memorandum titled
Procedural Irregularities with Temporary Orders realizing that he was
dealing with three potential abuses of discretion from three separate judges
(R. 2172– 2202). That same day, Father filed a second Petition for Writ of
Mandamus in the Second Court of Appeals, this time naming the Honorable
Jeff Kaitcer as Respondent under cause number 02-25-00166-CV (“the Void
Order Mandamus”) (R. 2396–2447) and filed an Emergency Motion for Stay
to halt the proceedings given the extraordinary circumstances of this matter.
(R. 2106–2123). See No. 02- 25-00166-CV The following day, Father filed a
third Petition for Writ of Mandamus, naming the Honorable Kenneth Newell
as Respondent under cause number 02-25- 00171-CV (“the Consolidation
Mandamus”) for his arbitrary grant of Mother’s contested motion without a
hearing (R. 2223–2253). On the same day, Father’s second mandamus
petition was denied per curiam. By April 17, 2025, all three mandamus
petitions had been denied per curiam, and Father moved for reconsideration
en banc in all three matters (R. 2448–2467; R. 2203–2217; R. 2155–2171),
thus giving birth to the “Dragon in Triplicate” – three separate judges 28
implicated in three distinct abuses of discretion within the same family law
matter. Y. The Sudden Move to Final Trial On April 23, 2025, with all three
mandamus petitions pending, Father received a Notice of Court Proceeding
scheduling a conference for April 29, 2025, purposed for setting the matter
for final trial (R. 1772–1772). That same day, Father filed a formal objection
to the setting (R. 2218–2222). The following day, Father’s first filed en banc
motion for reconsideration (the “Void Order” mandamus) was denied per
curiam by the appellate court. To address the unresolved issues regarding
subject-matter jurisdiction over these orders, Father filed a Plea to the
Jurisdiction asking the Honorable James Munford to clarify the legal basis
for the current orders (R. 2468–2479). In a further effort to protect his
procedural rights, Father filed a Second Motion to Recuse Judge Munford on
April 25, 2025 (R. 1787–1859). Later that same day, Mother notified Father
that the emergency circumstance which had formed the original basis for
Father’s urgent push for the Emergency TRO petition had now materialized
(R. 1766–1771). With this new development, Father filed a Notice of Non-
Appearance and Objection to Trial Setting (R. 2480–2486) and amended his
pending Motion to Recuse (R. 2487–2608). Despite the allegations and the
procedural defects raised, Judge Munford declined to recuse himself for a
second time without any substantive explanation (R. 2609–2613). 29
Separately, the Honorable Jeff Kaitcer—though not named in the recusal
motion—filed a voluntary recusal from the case (R. 2614–2618). In response,
Father filed an Objection to Procedural Handling of the Recusal
Proceedings, explaining that Judge Kaitcer’s referral order was improper
and specifically objected to the court coordinator managing the recusal
process (R. 2619–2625). On May 1, 2025, the appellate court denied

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Father’s two remaining en banc motions per curiam (R. 2626-2627;
2628-2629). That same day, Father filed his second Petition for Writ of
Mandamus before this Court under cause number 25- 0361. 7 He filed a
third petition the next day, May 2, 2025, under cause number 25- 0367,
followed by a fourth on May 7, 2025, under cause number 25-0378. There
are now three concurrent mandamuses before this Honorable Court, but the
risk of compounding error continues down below. Z. Risk of Future Error An
Order of Assignment was forwarded by the coordinator from the Honorable
David L. Evans appointing Senior Chief Justice John Cayce to oversee the
recusal matters on May 6, 2025 (R. 3148-3150). Because the Order of
Assignment still incorrectly named the Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer and the
coordinator was still handling the matters, Father filed a second objection
(R. 3151-3166). 7 The first filed mandamus before this court was filed on
April 8, 2024 under case number 25-0395. 30 AA. The Need for Relief
Continues On May 12, 2025, Father filed an Affidavit in cause number
25-0361 reiterating the need for an emergency stay of the trial court
proceedings (R. 3488- 3500). Three days later, the Honorable David L. Evans
overruled the Father’s objections regarding the involvement of the court
coordinator and the Hon. Kaitcer motion which was never filed (R.
3506-3508). The next day, Father filed an emergency notice with the Court
reiterating that the date by which he requested relief was approaching, and
he reiterated the need for an emergency stay and reminded the Court that
no opposition to the relief being sought had been raised. (R. 3501-3505). AB.
Mandamus #4 On May 19, 2025, the Father filed a Petition for Writ of
Mandamus before this Court as an Original Proceeding which was docketed
as case number 25-0426 on the grounds that the Regional Presiding Judge’s
refusal to comply with Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure was an
abuse of discretion (R. 3509-3559). Father then prepared a Case
Memorandum and filed it in that cause number (R. 3837-3876). The next
day, Father filed an Emergency Motion to Stay reiterating the need for a stay
of the proceedings below given errors continue to compound. (R.
3877-3896). AC. Mandamus #5 The very same day, Hon. John H. Cayce, Jr.,
assigned by Hon. David L. 31 Evans, summarily denied the recusal of Hon.
James Munford, District Judge of the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County
(R. 3897-3900). An order was also issued denying the recusal of Hon. Jeff
Kaitcer, referring to a motion that was never filed. (R. 3901-3904). The next
day, Father filed a Notice of Intent to File Mandamus, raising the issue “…
that the record, on its face, demonstrates a clear deviation from procedural
due process and established Texas jurisprudence regarding recusal
proceedings, warranting immediate corrective action to uphold this court’s
impartiality and public confidence in the judiciary.” (R. 3905-3914). AD.
Striking the OAG Finally, on May 22, 2025, Father filed a Motion to Strike
the Intervention of the Office of the Attorney General requesting that “[i]f a
justiciable interest cannot be demonstrated or if a response is not filed by a
future date deemed appropriate by the Court, order that the intervention
pleading from the Office of the Attorney General naming Holly Hayes as
counsel be stricken from the record (R. 3915-3956). sHOw how that the
court cannot just sua sponte move the case to final trial despite all of these
issues. charles myers has been abused by the judicial system, and must stop

and assignment of judges. Under Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a, a judge must take no
further action in a case after a motion to recuse is filed, except for good
cause stated in writing, until the motion is resolved. Any orders entered in
violation of this rule are voidable. See In re Union Pac. Res. Co., 969 S.W.2d
at 428. Proceeding to final trial while recusal motions are pending or have
been improperly handled is a violation of Rule 18a and due process, and any
resulting judgment is subject to being set aside on appeal or by mandamus.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
A Texas trial court cannot proceed to final trial while there are outstanding,
unresolved, or improperly handled recusal motions; doing so violates Tex. R.
Civ. P. 18a and due process, rendering any resulting judgment voidable and
subject to mandamus or reversal. The record here demonstrates repeated
and significant procedural violations, including failures to properly address
recusal motions, which preclude the court from moving forward to final trial.
Summary
Texas law imposes strict, mandatory procedures when a party files a motion
to recuse a judge: the judge must either recuse themselves or refer the
motion to the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district, and may
take no further action in the case until the motion is resolved, except for
good cause stated in writing. If a court disregards these requirements—by,
for example, setting a final trial while recusal motions are pending or have
been denied without proper process—any orders or judgments entered are
voidable and subject to being set aside on appeal or by mandamus.
In the present matter, the record reveals a pattern of judicial action in
violation of Rule 18a, including the issuance of orders and the scheduling of
a final trial despite unresolved or improperly handled recusal motions, as
well as other procedural irregularities. Under controlling Texas authority,
these actions constitute clear legal error and deprive the affected party,
Charles Myers, of due process, requiring that the court halt any further
proceedings—including a final trial—until all recusal issues are properly and
lawfully resolved.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, specifically Rule 18a, govern the recusal
and disqualification of judges in civil cases. Rule 18a provides that when a
motion to recuse is filed before evidence is offered at trial, the judge must
take no further action in the case until the motion is decided, except for
good cause stated in writing or on the record. The judge has only two
options: recuse themselves or refer the motion to the presiding judge of the

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
administrative judicial district for assignment to another judge for hearing
and decision. This rule is mandatory and applies to all Texas trial courts
except statutory probate and justice courts, and is reinforced by related
provisions in the Texas Government Code and the Texas Administrative
Code.
The Texas Government Code § 74.053 further provides that if a party files a
timely objection to the assignment of a judge, that judge is prohibited from
hearing the case. The Texas Administrative Code, 1 Tex. Admin. Code §
155.152, mirrors these requirements, mandating that if a judge does not
voluntarily recuse, another judge must be assigned to rule on the motion,
and that the process must be fair and transparent.
Case Law
Texas appellate courts have consistently and repeatedly held that the
requirements of Rule 18a are mandatory and not subject to judicial
discretion. When a recusal motion is filed, the judge must either recuse or
refer the motion; any further action in the case is prohibited until the motion
is resolved, unless there is good cause stated in writing. Failure to comply
with these requirements renders all subsequent judicial actions void or
voidable.
Key authorities include:
In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025): The court
held that when a recusal motion is filed, the judge must either grant the
motion or refer it to the regional presiding judge, and any orders
signed after the filing of a recusal motion, without addressing the
motion, are void and of no effect.
In re Lucio, 702-03, WR-72 (Tex. Crim. App. Apr 25, 2022): The
court emphasized that Rule 18a leaves the trial judge with no
discretion; the judge must either recuse or refer the motion, and cannot
determine the sufficiency of the allegations themselves.
Ex parte Thuesen, 546 S.W.3d 145 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017): Once a
judge recuses themselves, they cannot take further action in the case
unless there is good cause stated in writing.
In re Thompson, 330 S.W.3d 411 (Tex. App. 2010): The court
reiterated that after a recusal motion is filed, the judge must either
recuse or refer, and may not take further action except for good cause
stated in writing.
In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006): Even if a recusal
motion is defective, the judge must recuse or refer; failure to do so
renders all subsequent actions void.
Hudson v. Texas Children's Hosp., 177 S.W.3d 232 (Tex. 2005):
The Texas Supreme Court held that the recuse-or-refer procedure is
mandatory, and failure to follow it is error.

De Leon v. Aguilar, 127 S.W.3d 1 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004): The court
held that a judge cannot determine the sufficiency of a recusal motion
themselves; they must recuse or refer.
In re PG & E Reata Energy, et al, 4 S.W.3d 897 (Tex. App. 1999):
The court held that any action taken by a judge after a recusal motion
is filed, other than recusal or referral, is void.
Rio Grande Valley Gas Co., In re, 987 S.W.2d 167 (Tex. App.
1999): The court held that Rule 18a(d) prohibits a judge from taking
further action after a recusal motion is filed, unless there is good cause
stated in writing.
Brosseau v. Ranzau, 911 S.W.2d 890 (Tex. App. 1995): The court
held that failure to comply with Rule 18a renders all subsequent actions
void.
Winfield v. Daggett, 846 S.W.2d 920 (Tex. App. 1993): The court
held that a judge must recuse or refer and may not take further action
until the motion is resolved.
Lamberti v. Tschoepe, 776 S.W.2d 651 (Tex. App. 1989): The court
held that any orders made after denial of a recusal motion, without
following proper procedures, are void.
Greenberg, Fisk & Fielder v. Howell, 676 S.W.2d 431 (Tex. App.
1984): The court held that a judge cannot determine the procedural
sufficiency of a recusal motion themselves and must recuse or refer.
These authorities are consistent and unequivocal: the recusal process is
mandatory, and any deviation from the required procedure is a fundamental
error that voids subsequent judicial actions.
Analysis
Application of Law to the Present Facts
The record in this matter demonstrates a series of significant procedural
violations by the trial courts, including:
Issuance of Orders and Scheduling of Final Trial While Recusal
Motions Were Pending or Improperly Handled:
The courts proceeded to issue orders, including temporary orders and
the scheduling of a final trial, despite the existence of outstanding
recusal motions. In some instances, recusal motions were denied
without proper hearing or explanation, and in others, the referral
process was mishandled or delayed. Under Rule 18a and the controlling
case law, any action taken by a judge after a recusal motion is filed—
other than recusal or referral—is prohibited and renders subsequent
orders void or voidable, unless there is good cause stated in writing (In
re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025); In re Lucio, 702-03,
WR-72 (Tex. Crim. App. Apr 25, 2022); In re Thompson, 330 S.W.3d 411

(Tex. App. 2010); Hudson v. Texas Children's Hosp., 177 S.W.3d 232
(Tex. 2005)).
Failure to Properly Refer or Hear Recusal Motions:
The record shows that some recusal motions were denied without a
hearing, or the referral process was not properly followed. Texas law is
clear that a judge cannot determine the sufficiency of a recusal motion
themselves; they must either recuse or refer the motion to the
presiding judge for assignment to another judge for hearing (De Leon v.
Aguilar, 127 S.W.3d 1 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004); Greenberg, Fisk & Fielder
v. Howell, 676 S.W.2d 431 (Tex. App. 1984)). If a party is denied a
hearing on a timely and facially sufficient recusal motion, the case must
be abated for such a hearing (Pretrial Motions, 2021-08-16).
Voidability of Orders and Judgments Entered in Violation of Rule
18a:
The authorities are clear that any orders or judgments entered after a
recusal motion is filed, and before it is resolved, are void or voidable
unless there is good cause stated in writing (In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d
858 (Tex. App. 2006); Brosseau v. Ranzau, 911 S.W.2d 890 (Tex. App.
1995); Lamberti v. Tschoepe, 776 S.W.2d 651 (Tex. App. 1989)). This
includes orders setting a case for final trial, as well as any substantive
rulings.
Due Process Violations:
The failure to follow mandatory recusal procedures deprives the
affected party of due process, as it undermines the impartiality and
fairness of the proceedings (Aguilar v. Anderson, 855 S.W.2d 799 (Tex.
App. 1993); Woodruff v. Wright, 51 S.W.3d 727 (Tex. App. 2001)). The
right to an impartial tribunal is fundamental, and the recusal process is
designed to protect that right.
Other Procedural Irregularities:
The record also reflects other significant procedural errors, including
the issuance of a purported consent judgment where consent was
lacking, refusal to hear a properly filed emergency TRO, and improper
consolidation of cases without a hearing. While these issues are serious
and may independently warrant appellate or mandamus relief, the most
fundamental bar to proceeding to final trial is the unresolved status of
the recusal motions and the resulting voidability of all subsequent
judicial actions.
Synthesis
The cumulative effect of these procedural violations is to deprive Charles
Myers of a fair and impartial adjudication of his rights. Texas law is
unequivocal that a court cannot proceed to final trial while recusal motions
are pending or have been improperly handled. Any attempt to do so is a
violation of Rule 18a and due process, and any resulting judgment is subject
to being set aside on appeal or by mandamus (In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV
(Tex. App. May 07, 2025); In re PG & E Reata Energy, et al, 4 S.W.3d 897

The courts’ disregard for these mandatory procedures, as evidenced by the
record, constitutes clear legal error and an abuse of discretion. The only
lawful course is for the court to halt all proceedings—including the setting
or conduct of a final trial—until all recusal motions are properly and lawfully
resolved, with any necessary hearings conducted and orders entered in
compliance with Rule 18a.
Exceptions and Caveats
There is a narrow exception in Rule 18a that allows a judge to take further
action in a case after a recusal motion is filed, but only for good cause stated
in writing or on the record. The authorities make clear that this exception is
to be strictly construed and applied only in extraordinary circumstances,
such as to prevent irreparable harm or to address urgent matters that
cannot await resolution of the recusal motion (Rule 18a. Recusal and
Disqualification of Judges, Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a). The record here does not
reflect any such good cause stated in writing for proceeding to final trial or
issuing substantive orders while recusal motions were pending.
It should also be noted that while some older authorities suggest that an
erroneous denial of a recusal motion does not automatically void subsequent
judicial acts, but rather makes them reversible on appeal (Union Pacific
Resources Co., In re, 969 S.W.2d 427 (Tex. 1998)), the overwhelming weight
of more recent and directly applicable authority holds that actions taken in
violation of Rule 18a are void or voidable and subject to mandamus relief.
The distinction is that when the procedural requirements of Rule 18a are not
followed—such as by failing to recuse or refer, or by taking further action
without good cause—subsequent orders are not merely erroneous, but void.
Conclusion
Texas law is clear and unequivocal: a trial court cannot proceed to final trial,
or take any further substantive action, while there are outstanding,
unresolved, or improperly handled recusal motions. The mandatory
procedures of Rule 18a are designed to protect the fundamental right to an
impartial tribunal and due process. Any orders or judgments entered in
violation of these procedures are voidable and subject to being set aside on
appeal or by mandamus. In this case, the record demonstrates repeated and
significant violations of these requirements, and the court must halt all
proceedings—including the setting or conduct of a final trial—until all
recusal issues are properly and lawfully resolved. To do otherwise would
perpetuate the abuse of process and further deprive Charles Myers of his
rights under Texas law.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Rule 18a(a), (c), (d), and (f) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provide: ...
(c) Prior to any further proceedings in the case, the judge shall either recuse
himself or request the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district
to assign a judge to hear such motion. ... Except for good cause stated in the
order in which further action is taken, the judge shall make no further
orders and shall take no further action in the case after filing of the motion
and prior to a hearing on the motion.
Summary
Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure mandates that a judge must
either recuse themselves or refer the recusal motion to the presiding judge
of the administrative judicial district for a hearing. Importantly, the judge is
prohibited from taking further action in the case until the recusal motion is
resolved, unless there is good cause stated in writing. This ensures that due
process is maintained and that any actions taken while a recusal motion is
pending are voidable.
De Leon v. Aguilar, 127 S.W.3d 1 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004)
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
When a recusal motion is timely filed, Rule 18a leaves a trial judge with no
discretion—the trial judge must either recuse himself or refer the motion for
another judge to decide. See Rule 18a(c). Any criminal cases to the contrary
such as McClenan are overruled. Rule 18a does not contemplate that a trial
judge whose impartiality is questioned can nevertheless determine whether
the allegations of bias against him state sufficient grounds for recusal.
Summary
Rule 18a mandates that a judge must either recuse themselves or refer the
recusal motion to another judge if a recusal motion is timely filed. This is
relevant to the proposition because it highlights a procedural error if the
trial court failed to adhere to this rule, which is one of the legal errors
identified in the proposition.
In re PG & E Reata Energy, et al, 4 S.W.3d 897 (Tex. App. 1999)
Texas Court of Appeals

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
We held in In re Rio Grande Valley Gas that Judge Gonzalez's transfer of the
Recusal Cases was void because after a motion to recuse has been filed, a
judge must either recuse himself or herself or request the presiding judge to
assign a judge to hear the recusal motion 'prior to any further proceedings
in the case.' See TEX. R. CIV. P. 18a(c); In re Rio Grande Valley Gas, 987 S.W.
2d at 179 (emphasis in original). We further held that because motions to
recuse were pending against Judge Aparicio in each of the Recusal Cases, he
could take no action in those cases other than issue an order of recusal or
referral.
Summary
When a motion to recuse is filed, the judge must either recuse themselves or
request the presiding judge to assign another judge to hear the motion
before any further proceedings can occur. This ensures that the recusal
process is respected and that any actions taken by the judge after a recusal
motion is filed are void. This directly supports the proposition that the trial
court's actions, including proceeding to final trial while recusal motions are
pending, violate Rule 18a and due process.
In re Thompson., 330 S.W.3d 411 (Tex. App. 2010)

Extract
Rule 18a imposes certain mandatory requirements on a judge once a motion
to recuse is filed: (c) Prior to any further proceedings in the case, the judge
shall either recuse himself or request the presiding judge of the
administrative judicial district to assign a judge to hear such motion. If the
judge recuses himself, he shall enter an order of recusal and request the
presiding judge of the administrative judicial district to assign another judge
to sit, and shall make no further orders and shall take no further action in
the case except for good cause stated in the order in which such action is
taken. (d) If the judge declines to recuse himself, he shall forward to the
presiding judge of the administrative judicial district, in either original form
or certified copy, an order of referral, the motion, and all opposing and
concurring statements. Except for good cause stated in the order in which
further action is taken, the judge shall make no further orders and shall take
no further action in the case after filing of the motion and prior to a hearing
on the motion.
Summary
Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure mandates that once a motion
to recuse is filed, the judge must either recuse themselves or refer the
motion to the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district. The

=== PAGE 20 ===

judge is prohibited from taking further action in the case until the motion is
resolved, except for good cause stated in writing. This ensures that any
potential bias or conflict of interest is addressed before proceeding, thereby
upholding due process. The passage supports the proposition that
proceeding to final trial while recusal motions are pending or improperly
handled violates Rule 18a and due process, making any resulting judgment
subject to being set aside.
Rio Grande Valley Gas Co., In re, 987 S.W.2d 167 (Tex. App. 1999)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provides in relevant part: ...
(d) If the judge declines to recuse himself, he shall forward to the presiding
judge of the administrative judicial district, in either original form or
certified copy, an order of referral, the motion, and all opposing and
concurring statements. Except for good cause stated in the order in which
further action is taken, the judge shall make no further orders and shall take
no further action in the case after filing of the motion and prior to a hearing
on the motion.
Summary
Rule 18a(d) explicitly prohibits a judge from taking further action in a case
once a motion to recuse has been filed, unless there is good cause stated in
writing. This rule is designed to ensure impartiality and due process by
preventing a judge from making decisions in a case where their impartiality
has been questioned. The passage supports the proposition that proceeding
to final trial while recusal motions are pending or improperly handled
violates Rule 18a and due process, making any resulting judgment subject to
being set aside.
Union Pacific Resources Co., In re, 969 S.W.2d 427 (Tex. 1998)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Judges may be removed from a particular case either because they are
constitutionally disqualified, TEX. CONST. art. V, § 11, because they are
subject to a statutory strike, TEX. GOV'T CODE § 74.053(d), or because they
are recused under rules promulgated by this Court. TEX.R. CIV. P. 18a, 18b;
TEX.R.APP. P. 16. The grounds and procedures for each type of removal are
fundamentally different... In contrast, the erroneous denial of a recusal
motion does not void or nullify the presiding judge's subsequent acts. While
a judgment rendered in such circumstances may be reversed on appeal, it is

=== PAGE 21 ===

not fundamental error and can be waived if not raised by proper motion. See
Buckholts Indep. Sch. Dist., 632 S.W.2d at 148; Gulf Maritime Warehouse
Co. v. Towers, 858 S.W.2d 556, 559 (Tex.App.--Beaumont 1993, writ denied);

(Tex.App.--Houston [14 th Dist.] 1990, writ denied).
Summary
While an erroneous denial of a recusal motion does not automatically void
subsequent judicial acts, it can be grounds for reversal on appeal if properly
raised. This implies that proceeding to trial with unresolved or improperly
handled recusal motions could lead to judgments being set aside on appeal,
supporting the proposition that such actions violate procedural norms and
due process.
In re O'Connor, 92 S.W.3d 446 (Tex. 2002)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
In this mandamus proceeding, Lisa Black O'Connor seeks to disqualify the
trial judge from presiding over her suit for modification of the parent-child
relationship... O'Connor argues that, under these circumstances, the trial
judge was required to disqualify himself because the divorce action and the
modification proceeding involved the same matter in controversy. We agree
with O'Connor and conditionally grant the writ... Furthermore, contrary to
O'Brian's argument, rule 18b(1)(a) is not limited to preventing a lawyer
whose law firm represented a party in a specific lawsuit from presiding over
that same lawsuit when the lawyer becomes a judge. By its own terms, rule
18b(1)(a) is not limited to disqualifying a trial judge only when the 'same
lawsuit' is involved. Rather, in plain language, rule 18b(1)(a) requires
disqualification when the same 'matter in controversy' is involved... In these
circumstances, mandamus is available to compel the trial judge's
disqualification without a showing that the relator lacks an adequate remedy
by appeal.
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court recognizes the importance of disqualifying a judge
when there is a conflict of interest involving the same matter in controversy.
The court emphasizes that disqualification is not limited to the same lawsuit
but extends to the same matter in controversy. This supports the proposition
that proceeding to final trial while recusal motions are pending or
improperly handled violates procedural rules and due process, as any
resulting judgment can be set aside by mandamus.

Lamberti v. Tschoepe, 776 S.W.2d 651 (Tex. App. 1989)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The Texas Government Code provides that a district or statutory county
court judge shall request the presiding judge to assign another judge to hear
a motion relating to the recusal of the judge from a case pending in his own
court. TEX.GOV'T CODE ANN. § 74.059 (Vernon 1988). The Texas Rules of
Civil Procedure are explicit with regard to these motions. The trial judge has
two choices, recusal or referral. TEX.R.CIV.PROC.R. 18a(c). The rules
further provide: If the judge declines to recuse himself, he shall forward to
the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district, in either original
form or certified copy, an order of referral, the motion, and all opposing and
concerning statements. Except for good cause stated in the order in which
further action is taken, the judge shall make no further orders and shall take
no further action in the case after filing of the motion and prior to a hearing
on the motion. ... Because we have held that the trial court was without
power to continue to hear this case, any orders made subsequent to the
denial of the motion to recuse are void.
Summary
When a motion to recuse is filed, the judge has only two options: to recuse
themselves or to refer the motion to the presiding judge. The judge must not
take further action in the case until the motion is resolved. Any orders made
after the denial of a recusal motion, without following proper procedures,
are considered void. This supports the proposition that proceeding to final
trial while recusal motions are pending or improperly handled violates Rule
18a and due process.

The judge must either recuse themselves or refer the motion to another
judge. This rule is designed to ensure impartiality and due process. If a
judge fails to comply with this rule, it can be grounds for mandamus relief,
as the act of referring the motion is considered ministerial. This supports
the proposition that proceeding to a final trial while recusal motions are
pending or improperly handled violates Rule 18a and due process, making
any resulting judgment subject to being set aside.
Carson v. Gomez, 841 S.W.2d 491 (Tex. App. 1992)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Appellant asserts the trial judge was without jurisdiction to dismiss. Once a
motion to recuse has been filed, the trial judge has only two options, recusal
or referral. TEX.R.CIV.P. 18a(c). Rule 18a(d) provides: If the judge declines
to recuse himself, he shall forward to the presiding judge of the
administrative judicial district, in either original form or certified copy, an
order of referral, the motion, and all opposing and concurring statements.
Except for good cause stated in the order in which further action is taken,
the judge shall make no further orders and shall take no further action in
the case after filing of the motion and prior to a hearing on the motion.
TEX.R.CIV.P. 18a(d). ... Even if the motion were procedurally defective, the
trial judge should have referred the motion so that another judge would
make that determination. The Dallas Court of Appeals has held that 'a
recusal motion invokes both statute and rule the instant the motion is filed
and the judge named in the motion shall recuse or refer without regard to
the 'procedural sufficiency' of the motion itself.' Greenberg, Fisk, & Fielder
v. Howell, 676 S.W.2d 431, 433 (Tex.App.--Dallas 1984, no writ).
Summary
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a mandates that once a motion to recuse is
filed, the judge must either recuse themselves or refer the motion to another
judge. The judge is prohibited from taking further action in the case until
the motion is resolved unless there is good cause stated in writing. This
supports the proposition that proceeding to final trial while recusal motions
are pending or improperly handled is a violation of Rule 18a and due
process.
Brosseau v. Ranzau, 911 S.W.2d 890 (Tex. App. 1995)
Texas Court of Appeals

=== PAGE 24 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
There is a simple interpretation of Rule 18a. The appellate courts have
agreed that when presented with a motion to recuse a judge has two, and
only two, options. These options are for the judge to either recuse himself or
refer the motion to the presiding judge of the administrative judicial
district... If a trial court fails to comply with the rules provided for in Rule
18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, all actions taken by the judge
subsequent to such violation are void.
Summary
Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure mandates that a judge must
either recuse themselves or refer the motion to the presiding judge of the
administrative judicial district when a motion to recuse is filed. Failure to
comply with this rule renders any subsequent actions by the judge void. This
directly supports the proposition that the trial court's actions, in this case,
may be void due to the improper handling of recusal motions.
In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
On January 17, 2025, Gold filed a motion to recuse respondent. Respondent
signed the challenged temporary orders on January 21, 2025, rather than
granting the motion to recuse or signing an order referring it to the regional
presiding judge... Under the rule's clear terms, when a party files a motion
to recuse, the judge must either grant the motion or refer it to the regional
presiding judge... The failure to take one of these two actions renders
subsequent orders void... Additionally, 'If a motion is filed before evidence
has been offered at trial, the respondent judge must take no further action
in the case until the motion has been decided, except for good cause stated
in writing or on the record.'... We conclude that because the respondent
signed the temporary orders after relator filed a motion to recuse and the
record does not support a good cause exception as contemplated by rule
18a, the temporary orders are void and of no effect.
Summary
When a motion to recuse is filed, the judge must either grant the motion or
refer it to the regional presiding judge. Any action taken by the judge after
the filing of a recusal motion, without addressing the motion, renders
subsequent orders void. This directly supports the proposition that
procedural errors, such as failing to adhere to Rule 18a regarding recusal
proceedings, can result in void orders and are grounds for mandamus relief.

In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, Judge Austin had a mandatory
duty either to recuse himself or to refer the recusal motion to the presiding
judge. TEX.R. CIV. P. 18a. ... Even though a motion to recuse may be
defective, the challenged judge must either recuse or refer the motion, so
that another judge can determine the procedural adequacy and merits of the
motion to recuse. ... If a judge fails to comply with the rules governing
motions for recusal, all subsequent actions by the judge in that case are
void.
Summary
The passage emphasizes that under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, a
judge has a mandatory duty to either recuse themselves or refer a recusal
motion to the presiding judge. This duty is not optional, and failure to
comply with this rule renders all subsequent actions by the judge void. This
supports the proposition that the court cannot proceed to a final trial while
there are outstanding recusal motions or procedural irregularities in
handling such motions, as any actions taken in violation of Rule 18a are
voidable.
Woodruff v. Wright, 51 S.W.3d 727 (Tex. App. 2001)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
When a motion to recuse has been filed, a judge must either recuse himself
or request the presiding administrative judge to assign another judge to
hear the motion. Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(a),(c),(d). ... The Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure provide that a judge shall recuse himself in any proceeding in
which 'his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.' Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(2)
(a). We review the denial of a motion to recuse for abuse of discretion. Tex.
R. Civ. P. 18a(f); ... The test for abuse of discretion is not whether in the
opinion of the reviewing court the facts present an appropriate case for the
trial court's action; rather, it is a question of whether the court acted
without reference to any guiding rules or principles.
Summary
Procedural requirements for recusal under Texas Rules of Civil Procedure
18a and 18b, emphasizing that a judge must either recuse themselves or
request another judge to hear the motion if their impartiality might
reasonably be questioned. It also highlights that the denial of a recusal

motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion, which occurs when a court acts
without reference to guiding rules or principles. This supports the
proposition by highlighting the procedural errors and potential abuse of
discretion in handling recusal motions, which are part of the legal errors
identified in the proposition.
Bruno v. State, 916 S.W.2d 4 (Tex. App. 1995)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
We review a judge's denial of a motion to recuse based on an abuse of
discretion standard. ... Appellant argues that once a recusal motion is filed, a
judge must recuse himself or herself or refer the case to the presiding judge
of the administrative district. As support, appellant cites both TEX.GOV'T
CODE ANN. § 74.059(c)(3) and TEX.R.CIV.P. 18a. ... Rule 18a addresses the
requirements of a motion for recusal or disqualification of trial court
judges. ... Prior to any further proceedings in the case, the judge shall either
recuse himself or request the presiding judge of the administrative judicial
district to assign a judge to hear such motion. ... In Winfield v. Daggett, ...
the trial judge erred in refusing to either recuse himself or refer the motion
for hearing to the administrative judge. Once the trial judge refused to
recuse himself, he had a duty to forward the motion to the presiding judge of
the administrative judicial district.
Summary
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a mandates that once a motion to recuse is
filed, the judge must either recuse themselves or refer the motion to the
presiding judge of the administrative judicial district. This rule is applicable
to ensure impartiality and proper handling of recusal motions. The failure to
adhere to this rule, as highlighted in the passage, can result in procedural
errors and potential voiding of subsequent judicial actions. This directly
supports the proposition that the trial court's actions, in this case, may have
violated procedural norms by not properly handling recusal motions.
Hudson v. Texas Children's Hosp., 177 S.W.3d 232 (Tex. 2005)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Once a motion to recuse is filed in statutory probate court, the trial judge
has two options before taking any other action: (1) recuse himself or (2)
request that the presiding judge of the statutory probate courts assign a
judge to hear the motion to recuse. Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 25.00255(f)
(Vernon 2004); TEX.R. CIV. P. 18a(c). The Texas Supreme Court has held that

=== PAGE 27 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the recuse or refer procedure is mandatory. See McLeod v. Harris, 582 S.W.
2d 772, 774 (Tex.1979). ... We hold that the trial judge erred when he did not
follow the mandatory requirements either to recuse himself or to refer the
motion to recuse to the presiding judge of the statutory probate courts and
instead denied the motion to recuse.
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court mandates a specific procedure for handling
motions to recuse, which involves either recusal by the judge or referral to
the presiding judge. This procedure is mandatory and not following it
constitutes an error. This supports the proposition that there were
procedural errors in handling recusal motions in the case at hand.
Greenberg, Fisk & Fielder v. Howell, 676 S.W.2d 431 (Tex. App. 1984)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Greenberg, Fisk and Fielder, a professional corporation composed of
practicing members of the Bar, in behalf of themselves and their clients in
nine unrelated cases pending in the 191st Judicial District Court, seek
mandamus directing the judge of said court, Charles Ben Howell, to set
aside his orders holding their recusal motions (an identical motion on
identical grounds was filed in each of the nine cases) 'procedurally
insufficient' and to require Judge Howell to obey Rule 18a TEX.R.CIV.P.
(1983) by either recusing himself or entering an order of referral of such
motions to the presiding judge of the administrative district. We
conditionally grant the relief sought... By his brief resisting the writ, Judge
Howell urges that, since he has determined that the recusal motions are
procedurally insufficient, no mandamus should issue. To the contrary, we
hold that, since both statute and rule forbid any determination with regard
to the recusal motions by Judge Howell, the writ must issue, unless Judge
Howell promptly enters either order permitted to him, i.e. recusal or
referral.
Summary
The passage from "Greenberg, Fisk & Fielder v. Howell" supports the
proposition by highlighting the mandatory nature of Rule 18a, which
requires a judge to either recuse themselves or refer the recusal motion to
the presiding judge of the administrative district. The passage emphasizes
that a judge cannot determine the procedural sufficiency of a recusal motion
themselves and must follow the procedure outlined in Rule 18a. This directly
supports the proposition that the failure to adhere to Rule 18a regarding
recusal proceedings is a significant legal error.

Ex parte Thuesen, 546 S.W.3d 145 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017)
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
The judge at issue signed an order voluntarily recusing himself from
presiding over applicant's habeas proceedings. He then sought and obtained
the appointment of a replacement judge, but subsequently signed an order
purporting to restore his own judicial authority to preside over the case. For
the reasons explained below, we hold that the judge did not have authority
to take any further action after signing the voluntary recusal order. We
therefore restore this matter to its position immediately following the
replacement judge's assignment to the case and remand it to the trial court
for further proceedings... Rule 18a sets out the procedures to be followed
when a party moves to recuse a trial judge... Rule 18b's recusal language 'is
imperative and mandatory, not permissive or discretionary.'... If a district
judge determines on the judge's own motion that the judge should not sit in
a case pending in the judge's court because the judge is disqualified or
otherwise should recuse himself or herself, the judge shall enter a recusal
order, request the presiding judge of that administrative judicial region to
assign another judge to sit, and take no further action in the case except for
good cause stated in the order in which the action is taken.
Summary
Once a judge has recused themselves, they cannot take further action in the
case unless there is good cause stated in writing. This supports the
proposition that proceeding to final trial while recusal motions are pending
or have been improperly handled is a violation of Rule 18a and due process.
The passage emphasizes the mandatory nature of recusal procedures and
the lack of authority for a judge to act after recusal, which aligns with the
issues raised in the proposition regarding procedural irregularities and the
need for proper handling of recusal motions.

Summary
Standards and procedures for recusal of judges in Texas, emphasizing that
judges must recuse themselves if their impartiality might reasonably be
questioned. It also highlights the procedural requirements for recusal
motions, including the necessity for a judge to either recuse themselves
voluntarily or refer the motion to the presiding judge of the administrative
district. This is relevant to the proposition as it underscores the importance
of adhering to procedural norms in recusal proceedings, which is one of the
legal errors identified in the proposition.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.053 Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.053 Objection to Judge
Assigned to a Trial Court
Extract
If a party to a civil case files a timely objection to the assignment, the judge
shall not hear the case. Except as provided by Subsection (d), each party to
the case is only entitled to one objection under this section for that case.
Summary
If a party to a civil case files a timely objection to the assignment of a judge,
the judge is prohibited from hearing the case. This supports the proposition
that procedural errors, such as failing to adhere to rules regarding judge
assignments and recusal, can lead to significant legal errors. The passage
highlights the importance of following procedural norms to ensure fairness
and due process, which is relevant to the issues raised in the proposition
regarding the handling of recusal and assignment of judges.

Summary
The Texas Administrative Code provides a clear procedure for handling
motions to recuse or disqualify judges. It requires that if a judge does not
voluntarily recuse themselves, another judge must be assigned to rule on
the motion. This ensures that the process is handled fairly and that any
potential bias or conflict of interest is addressed. The passage supports the
proposition that proceeding to final trial while recusal motions are pending
or improperly handled violates procedural norms and due process, as it
emphasizes the importance of resolving such motions before further action
is taken in the case.

Tex. R. Civ. Pro. 18a. Recusal or Disqualification of Judges... (c) Prior to any
further proceedings in the case, the judge shall either recuse himself or
request the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district to assign a
judge to hear such motion... Except for good cause stated in the order in
which further action is taken, the judge shall make no further orders and
shall take no further action in the case after filing of the motion and prior to
a hearing on the motion.
Summary
Tex. R. Civ. Pro. 18a mandates that once a motion to recuse is filed, the
judge must either recuse themselves or request the assignment of another
judge to hear the motion. Importantly, the judge is prohibited from taking
further action in the case until the motion is resolved, unless there is good
cause stated in writing. This supports the proposition that proceeding to
final trial while recusal motions are pending or improperly handled is a
violation of Rule 18a and due process.

Except for good cause stated in the order in which further action is taken,
the judge shall make no further orders and shall take no further action in
the case after filing of the motion and prior to a hearing on the motion.
Summary
Once a motion to recuse is filed, the judge is restricted from taking further
action in the case until the motion is resolved, unless there is good cause
stated in writing. This ensures that the process is fair and that any potential
bias or conflict of interest is addressed before proceeding. If a judge
proceeds to trial without resolving a pending recusal motion, it violates the
procedural rules and due process, making any resulting judgment voidable.

When a recusal motion is filed, the trial judge against whom the motion is
directed may properly make an initial decision of whether the motion is
sufficient to invoke Rule 18a... Once a sufficient motion to recuse has been
filed, before proceeding further in the case, the judge must either recuse
himself or request the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district
to assign a judge to hear the motion under Tex. Gov’t Code §74.059(c)(3).
Summary
When a recusal motion is filed, the trial judge must either recuse themselves
or request the assignment of another judge to hear the motion. This aligns
with Rule 18a, which restricts further action in the case until the motion is
resolved. Therefore, proceeding to a final trial while such motions are
pending or improperly handled would violate these procedural
requirements.

Summary
Procedural requirements for handling recusal motions under Texas Rule of
Civil Procedure 18a. It emphasizes that once a sufficient motion to recuse is
filed, the judge must either recuse themselves or refer the motion for a
hearing. The passage also highlights that a judge cannot take further action
after signing a voluntary recusal order, and any interim orders must be
documented in writing. This supports the proposition by underscoring the
procedural errors related to recusal motions and the potential voidability of
actions taken in violation of these rules.

Procedural requirements for handling recusal motions in Texas courts. It
emphasizes that once a motion to recuse is filed, the judge must either
recuse themselves or request the assignment of another judge to hear the
motion. If a recusal motion is timely and facially sufficient, a hearing must
be held. If a party is denied a hearing on their recusal motion, the case
should be abated back to the trial court for such a hearing. This supports the
proposition that procedural errors, such as failing to properly handle recusal
motions, can lead to significant legal errors and the need for corrective
action.

When a recusal motion is filed, the trial judge against whom the motion is
directed may properly make an initial decision of whether the motion is
sufficient to invoke Rule 18a... Once a sufficient motion to recuse has been

Summary
When a recusal motion is filed, the judge must either recuse themselves or
request the assignment of another judge to hear the motion. This is in
accordance with Rule 18a and the Texas Government Code. If a recusal
motion is timely and facially sufficient, a hearing is required. This supports
the proposition that proceeding to final trial while recusal motions are
pending or improperly handled violates procedural rules and due process.
Rule 18a. Recusal and Disqualification of Judges
Extract
Restrictions on Further Action. (A) Motion Filed Before Evidence Offered at
Trial. If a motion is filed before evidence has been offered at trial, the
respondent judge must take no further action in the case until the motion
has been decided, except for good cause stated in writing or on the record.
Summary
The passage clearly states that when a motion to recuse is filed before
evidence is offered at trial, the judge must refrain from taking further action
in the case until the motion is resolved. This restriction is in place to ensure
impartiality and fairness in judicial proceedings. If a judge proceeds to trial
without resolving pending recusal motions, it violates Rule 18a, which could
lead to the judgment being set aside on appeal or by mandamus. This
supports the proposition that proceeding to final trial under such
circumstances is a violation of due process.
