Question
In Texas, does a de novo request need to explicitly state that it is a de novo request, or can it be implied?
Answer (Texas)
Short response
In Texas, a de novo request must be made explicitly in writing and must specify the issues to be presented; it cannot be implied. Both statutory law and case law
require that the request clearly state the intent to seek a de novo hearing and identify the issues for review.
Summary
Texas law mandates that a party seeking a de novo hearing after a ruling by an associate judge or master must file a written request that explicitly specifies the
issues to be addressed by the referring court. This requirement is consistently reflected in the Texas Family Code, Government Code, and Tax Code, as well as
in appellate and Supreme Court decisions interpreting these statutes.
The explicitness requirement serves to provide clarity to the court and opposing parties about which issues are being challenged and ensures that the scope of
the de novo hearing is properly limited. Courts have repeatedly held that an implied or ambiguous request is insufficient; the request must be clear, unambiguous,
and in writing, with the issues for review specifically identified.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
The Texas Family Code, Government Code, and Tax Code each contain provisions governing requests for de novo hearings following decisions by associate
judges or masters. The relevant statutes are:
Texas Family Code § 201.015: This section governs de novo hearings before the referring court in family law matters. It requires that a request for a de novo
hearing must specify the issues to be presented to the referring court. The statute’s language makes clear that the request must be explicit, as it is not
possible to specify issues in an implied request. The hearing itself is limited to the issues specified in the request, reinforcing the need for clarity and specificity
(Tex. Fam. Code § 201.015).
Texas Government Code § 54A.115 and § 54A.216: These sections apply to civil associate judges and statutory probate court associate judges,
respectively. Both require that a request for a de novo hearing must specify the issues to be presented to the referring court, and the hearing is limited to those
issues. The statutory language again indicates that the request must be explicit and in writing (Tex. Gov't. Code § 54A.115; Tex. Gov't. Code § 54A.216).
Texas Tax Code § 33.74: In the context of tax delinquency cases, this section requires that appeals to the referring court be in writing and specify the findings
and conclusions of the master that are objected to. The appeal is limited to those specified findings and conclusions, and the parties may present evidence de
novo only on the issues raised in the appeal (Tex. Tax Code § 33.74).
Each of these statutes was last amended in or before 2025, and there is no indication in the provided materials of any subsequent amendments that would alter
these requirements.
Case Law
Texas appellate and Supreme Court decisions have consistently interpreted these statutes to require an explicit, written request for a de novo hearing that
specifies the issues to be reviewed:
In re Interest of A.L.M.-F., 593 S.W.3d 271 (Tex. 2019): The Texas Supreme Court held that a party must file a written request for a de novo hearing, and the
hearing is limited to the specific issues stated in the request. The Court emphasized that the process is mandatory when properly invoked, but the scope is
limited to the issues delineated in the motion for de novo review (In re Interest of A.L.M.-F., 593 S.W.3d 271 (Tex. 2019)).
Perez v. Cerda, 04-23-00472-CV (Tex. App. Oct 09, 2024): The appellate court reiterated that a request for a de novo hearing must specify the issues to be
presented, citing the relevant Government Code provision. The court’s order to hold a de novo hearing was expressly limited to the issues identified in the
written notice of appeal and request for a de novo hearing (Perez v. Cerda, 04-23-00472-CV (Tex. App. Oct 09, 2024)).
In re A.C. (Tex. App. Nov. 15, 2023): The court noted that a party may request a de novo hearing by filing a written request within three days of receiving
notice of the associate judge’s order. The requirement for a written request implies that the request must be explicit and documented, not implied (In re A.C.
(Tex. App. Nov. 15, 2023)).
In re J.M.C. (Tex. App. Dec. 17, 2021): The court held that de novo hearings are limited to the specific issues stated in the de novo hearing request, which
must be filed in writing. This again supports the requirement for an explicit, written request (In re J.M.C. (Tex. App. Dec. 17, 2021)).
M. J. M. v. Tex. Dep't of Family & Protective Servs., NO. 03-19-00336-CV (Tex. App. Dec 13, 2019): The court cited the Family Code’s requirement that a
request for a de novo hearing must specify the issues to be presented, indicating that the request must be explicit and cannot be implied (M. J. M. v. Tex.
Dep't of Family & Protective Servs., NO. 03-19-00336-CV (Tex. App. Dec 13, 2019)).
In re S.S.R., NUMBER 13-18-00576-CV (Tex. App. Mar 21, 2019): The court found that the parents’ request for a de novo hearing was unambiguous and
clearly specified the issues being contested, as required by statute (In re S.S.R., NUMBER 13-18-00576-CV (Tex. App. Mar 21, 2019)).

Supplementary cases, such as C. A. v. Tex. Dep't of Family & Protective Servs. (Tex. App. Aug 18, 2020) and In re Interest of N.M. (Tex. App. May 09,
2017), further reinforce the requirement for a timely and explicit written request, though they do not add new principles beyond those established in the essential
authorities.
Analysis
The statutory and case law authorities are uniform in their requirement that a request for a de novo hearing in Texas must be explicit, in writing, and must specify
the issues to be presented to the referring court. This requirement is not merely procedural; it is substantive, as the scope of the de novo hearing is strictly limited
to the issues identified in the request.
The legislative provisions in the Family Code, Government Code, and Tax Code all use language that requires the party seeking a de novo hearing to specify the
issues for review. This is not a formality; it is a jurisdictional prerequisite for the referring court to conduct a de novo hearing. The statutes do not contemplate or
permit an implied request, as an implied request would not provide the necessary specificity regarding the issues to be reviewed.
The case law consistently interprets these statutes to require an explicit, written request. The Texas Supreme Court in In re Interest of A.L.M.-F. made clear that
the process is mandatory when properly invoked, but the scope is limited to the issues stated in the request. The appellate courts have followed this approach,
requiring that the request be unambiguous and specify the issues for review.
The rationale for this requirement is to provide notice to the court and opposing parties about which issues are being challenged, to allow for proper preparation,
and to ensure that the de novo hearing is focused and efficient. Allowing implied requests would undermine these purposes and create uncertainty about the
scope of the hearing.
In practice, a party seeking a de novo hearing must file a written request with the clerk of the referring court within the statutory time frame (typically three working
days after receiving notice of the associate judge’s ruling or order), and the request must clearly state that a de novo hearing is sought and identify the specific
issues to be reviewed. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in the loss of the right to a de novo hearing on those issues.
Exceptions and Caveats
There are no significant exceptions in the provided authorities to the requirement for an explicit, written request specifying the issues for de novo review. The
statutes and cases are clear and consistent on this point.
It is possible that, in extraordinary circumstances, a court might consider whether a defective request could be amended or whether substantial compliance with
the statutory requirements might suffice. However, none of the provided authorities support the proposition that an implied request is sufficient, and the consistent
emphasis on specificity and explicitness suggests that courts are unlikely to excuse a failure to make a clear, written request.
Additionally, the authorities do not require that the request use the precise words "de novo hearing," but the request must clearly communicate the intent to seek
such a hearing and must specify the issues to be reviewed. Ambiguous or general objections are insufficient.
Conclusion
In summary, Texas law requires that a request for a de novo hearing be made explicitly in writing and must specify the issues to be presented to the referring
court. This requirement is grounded in the relevant statutes and has been consistently interpreted and enforced by Texas appellate and Supreme Court decisions.
An implied or ambiguous request is insufficient; the request must be clear, unambiguous, and in writing, with the issues for review specifically identified. Failure to
comply with these requirements may result in the loss of the right to a de novo hearing on the contested issues.
Key authorities supporting this conclusion include:

Tex. Fam. Code § 201.015
•
Tex. Gov't. Code § 54A.115
•
Tex. Gov't. Code § 54A.216

The law is clear: a de novo request in Texas must be explicit, in writing, and must specify the issues to be reviewed. An implied request is not sufficient.

The record in this case shows that Mother and Father timely filed an appeal of the associate judge's report and that they each unambiguously requested a de
novo hearing on '[a]ll issues of fact and findings of law related to' the termination of their parental rights and the associate judge's finding that termination was in
the children's best interests. Mother and Father requested a de novo hearing on October 3, 2018, which was within three working days of receiving notice of the
substance of the associate judge's report. See TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. § 201.015(a). Their request clearly specified which findings and conclusions of the
associate judge that Mother and Father objected to. See id.§ 201.015(b).
Summary
The request for a de novo hearing must be unambiguous and clearly specify the issues being contested. This suggests that the request should explicitly state that
it is a de novo request and specify the issues, rather than being implied. The reference to Texas Family Code § 201.015(b) supports the requirement for
specificity in the request.

Extract
Accordingly, we abate the appeal, remand the case to the 341st District Court (Honorable Beckie Palomo), and order the district court, on or before November 8,
2024, to hold a de novo hearing on the issues identified for presentation in the April 14, 2023 notice of appeal to the district court and request for a de novo
hearing. Tex. Gov't Code § 54A.115(b) ('A request for a de novo hearing under this section must specify the issues that will be presented to the referring court.
The de novo hearing is limited to the specified issues.'); 54A.115(f) ('In the de novo hearing before the referring court, the parties may present witnesses on the
issues specified in the request for hearing. The referring court may also consider the record from the hearing before the associate judge, including the charge to
and verdict returned by a jury, if the record was taken by a court reporter.').
Summary
A request for a de novo hearing in Texas must specify the issues that will be presented to the referring court. This implies that the request must be explicit in
identifying the issues for the de novo hearing, suggesting that an implied request without specific issues may not be sufficient.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Statute permits one to seek a de novo hearing from findings rendered by an associate judge. See TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. § 201.015(a)(1) & (2) (West Supp.
2016) (stating that a party may request a de novo hearing before the court that referred the cause to the associate judge by filing a written request not later than
the third working day after the date the party receives notice of 1) the substance of the associate judge's report or 2) the rendering of the temporary order).
Summary
A party may request a de novo hearing by filing a written request. It does not explicitly state that the request must be labeled as a "de novo request," but it does
imply that the request must be in writing and filed within a specific timeframe. The requirement for a written request suggests that the intent to seek a de novo
hearing must be clear, though it does not explicitly state that the term "de novo" must be used.

Thereafter, a party may request a de novo hearing before the referring court by filing a written request within three days of receiving notice of the associate
judge's order. Id. § 201.015(a) (West 2023). If properly requested, the de novo hearing is mandatory. See id. § 201.015(f) ('The referring court ... shall hold a de
novo hearing not later than the 30th day after the date on which the initial request for a de novo hearing was filed with the clerk of the referring court.'); Int. of
A.L.M.-F., 593 S.W.3d 271, 279 (Tex. 2019) (de novo hearing process is 'mandatory when invoked').
Summary
The passage from the Texas Family Code indicates that a party must file a written request for a de novo hearing within a specified time frame. The use of the
term "written request" suggests that the request must be explicit and documented, rather than implied. The requirement for a written request implies that the
intention to seek a de novo hearing must be clearly communicated in writing, rather than being inferred or implied from other actions or statements.
