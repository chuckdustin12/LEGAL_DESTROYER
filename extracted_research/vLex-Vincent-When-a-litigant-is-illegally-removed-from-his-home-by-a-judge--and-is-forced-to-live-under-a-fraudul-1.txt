Question
When a litigant is illegally removed from his home by a judge, and is forced
to live under a fraudulent settlement agreement that claims he agrees but
lacks his signature, and all appeals and efforts to overturn it fail, and the
judges sua sponte set the case for final trial in the midst of all of these
issues, what can the litigant do to prevent permenant loss of property
interests and stop the final trial, especially when he's pursuing relief for
damages from the removal from the home in a concurrent RICO case in
federal court? The divorce is the product of conduct of an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity, and should be dismissed as a
matter of law. The judges have refused to follow the law in texas, and the
litigant is out of state court options. Here's some context: NOTICE: THIS

courts operate under a foundational presumption of impartiality. However,
this presumption can be overcome if a movant presents compelling evidence

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
of bias that fundamentally threatens due process. The Texas Court of
Appeals has emphasized this requirement: bias must be so severe that it
denies the movant a fair and impartial hearing. In Interest of E.R.C., 496
S.W.3d 270, 280 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2016, pet. denied); Ex parte Ellis,
275 S.W.3d 109, 117 (Tex. App.—Austin 2008, no pet.). Simply put, due
process mandates that all parties are heard by a neutral, detached judge.
Brumit v. State, 206 S.W.3d 639, 644-45 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006). This is not
just a procedural necessity; it’s enshrined in both the U.S. Constitution and
the Texas Constitution. Texas courts use the "reasonable person" test to
determine whether recusal is appropriate: Would a well-informed, impartial
observer reasonably question the judge's impartiality based on the known
facts? Hansen v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., 346 S.W.3d 769, 776 (Tex.
App.—Dallas 2011, no pet.) (quoting Sears v. Olivarez, 28 S.W.3d 611, 615
(Tex. App.-Corpus Christi 2000, order) (en banc) (internal quotations and
citations omitted). If the answer is yes, recusal is warranted. In this case,
numerous procedural missteps and decisions have seriously jeopardized the
perception of fairness. Texas precedent, therefore, supports a careful review
to uphold the judicial integrity required by law. Without evidence admitted
in this matter, and without any findings on behalf of the tribunal, the court
chose to sever the parent-child relationship for one parent due to false
claims made by another prior to being afforded an opportunity to present his
case. 1 II. ARGUMENT This case exemplifies a serious violation of core due
process principles, particularly in the failure of the 322nd District Court of
Tarrant County as a whole to substantiate its rulings with factual findings or
evidentiary support. Such ungrounded decisions have resulted in substantial
harm, indicating a concerning bias that jeopardizes a fair resolution. This
bias has disrupted the parent-child relationship by unjustly favoring one
parent, despite indications that this party has prioritized personal interests
over the children’s welfare, while penalizing the other without lawful basis.
Without any factual or legal justification for these decisions, the only
reasonable inference is an underlying bias, likely fueled by either fraudulent
pleadings submitted by the Petitioner or an extrajudicial influence not in the
record. These circumstances call for recusal to restore impartiality and
procedural integrity. The judges’ actions contravene their duties under the
Texas Code of Judicial Conduct, disregarding fundamental protections
enshrined in both the U.S. Constitution and Texas law. Given these
considerations, Respondent CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS respectfully
requests that the Court grant the Joint Motion to Recuse and, in the interest
of judicial economy, issue judgment without a hearing if the opposing party
does not respond by a designated date deemed appropriate by the court.
The Respondent further seeks pre-admission of uncontested evidence
relevant to this motion to assist the Court’s determination. Given the
questionable handling of the case, the original Joint Motion to Recuse has
been concurrently attached as a separate lead document, fully hyperlinked
for convenience. 2 III. Performing the Duties of Judicial Office Impartially
and Diligently There are three prongs present within Canon 3 of the Texas
Rules of Judicial Conduct. All three prongs, in general, “take precedence
over all the judge's other activities”, and each set forth standards to be
followed in during the performance of such duties.1 The issue is whether
District Judge James Munford and Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer should be
recused. The rules and analysis of how they were applied in this case can
only lead a reasonable fact finder to conclude that their recusal is

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
warranted. A. PRONG 1 – ADJUDICATIVE DUTIES The first prong is the
adjudicative standard outlined in Canon 3(B) of the Texas Code of Judicial
Conduct. Paragraph 2 requires that “[a] judge should be faithful to the law
and shall maintain professional competence in it,” and specifies that “[a]
judge shall not be swayed by partisan interests, public clamor, or fear of
criticism.” Additionally, Paragraph 5 mandates that a judge “perform judicial
duties without bias or prejudice,” while Paragraph 8 ensures that “[a] judge
shall accord to every person who has a legal interest in a proceeding, or that
person's lawyer, the right to be heard according to law.” Further, Paragraph
9 sets the standard that “[a] judge should dispose of all judicial matters
promptly, efficiently and fairly.” All of these paragraphs are directly relevant
and can be applied in the determination of recusal. 1 Tex. Code Jud. Conduct
Canon 3(A) 3 B. PRONG 2 – ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES Standards for a
judge’s administrative responsibilities are outlined under Canon 3(C) of the
Texas Code of Judicial Conduct. Paragraph 1 requires that “[a] judge should
diligently and promptly discharge the judge's administrative responsibilities
without bias or prejudice, maintain professional competence in judicial
administration, and cooperate with other judges and court officials in the
administration of court business.” Additionally, paragraph 2 mandates that a
judge must ensure that “staff, court officials, and others subject to the
judge's direction and control observe the standards of fidelity and diligence
that apply to the judge and refrain from manifesting bias or prejudice in the
performance of their official duties.” These standards are critical to the
recusal motion because they underscore the judge's obligation not only to
maintain impartiality in personal actions but also to actively prevent bias or
prejudice in all court operations under their oversight. C. PRONG 3 –
DISCIPLINARY DUTIES Canon 3(D) of the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct
outlines a judge's disciplinary responsibilities, which directly relate to
maintaining the ethical integrity of the judicial process. Paragraph 1
requires that if a judge has clear information that another judge has violated
the Code, they must take appropriate action. When the violation raises
substantial concerns about the other judge's fitness for office, the judge is
obligated to inform the State Commission on Judicial Conduct or take other
suitable measures. Similarly, Paragraph 2 mandates that a judge who learns
of a lawyer’s serious 4 breach of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of
Professional Conduct—especially one that questions the lawyer’s honesty,
trustworthiness, or overall fitness—must report the violation to the Office of
the General Counsel of the State Bar of Texas or take other appropriate
action. These disciplinary obligations are highly relevant to the recusal
motion. The standards reinforce a judge’s duty to uphold ethical conduct
across all roles in the judicial system, ensuring that neither judicial nor legal
misconduct goes unaddressed. In cases where bias, impropriety, or ethical
breaches by a presiding judge are evident, the principles in Canon 3(D)
underscore the necessity of recusal to protect the integrity of the
proceedings and maintain the judiciary's credibility in the eyes of the public.
Notwithstanding the reasons set forth in the joint motion to recuse, the
additional facts explained below show an intentional effort to deprive the
Respondent access to justice after he has exhausted all other State
remedies, and one needs to look no further than how the joint recusal
motion was handled to highlight this effort showcasing the appearance of
impartiality, which warrants recusal. D. THE TEXAS RULES OF CIVIL
PROCEDURE Pursuant to the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 18(a)(f), the

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Respondent judges have two options once a motion to recuse is filed. 1) the
judge can file with the clerk an order of recusal or disqualification, or 2) the
judge can sign and file with the clerk an order referring the motion to the
regional presiding judge. 5 7. Rather than filing the orders of referral with
the clerk of the court, they were forwarded from the court coordinator via
email, Lindsey Baker, without the required certificate of service and remain
inaccessible through the Texas Supreme Court approved electronic filing
manager, re:Search Texas. The original motion was altered and did not
contain the affidavit or exhibits vital to the motion. This fact was promptly
pointed out in Exhibit 1, where the file size difference can be seen from the
email attachments. Click for reference. Lindsey Baker then confirmed that
the exhibits and affidavits had been forwarded. The file size difference was
then pointed out in the last correspondence chain found within Exhibit 1, to
which an amended order of referral followed, and the reasons given for the
modification of the original motion changed due to the motion’s length,
thereby justifying the modification of the original motion into three parts.
See Exhibit 2. Click for reference. Given that the very purpose of re:Search
Texas is to streamline the process of service and case management, it raises
the question as to why the court would choose to utilize the platform up
until the joint motion to recuse was filed. Further, the Frequently Asked
Questions found within the District Clerk’s website for electronic filing
specifically reiterate that exhibits should be merged into one document with
the lead document, and that the file size limit is 35mb. Given that the
Respondent’s original joint motion to recuse was well under the maximum
size of 35mb, and the joint motion was filed as one document as the clerk
prefers – why was it modified and served outside of 6 the requirements of
Rule 21a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure? These facts were highlighted
in the Respondent’s formal objection filed and served on all parties through
the EFM on October 10, 2024, and is attached hereto as Exhibit 3, and
remains undocketed at the time of filing this motion. Click for reference.
Finally, contradicting everything above, Judge Jeff Kaitcer’s order of referral
was properly served through the EFM as one document, with the affidavit
and all exhibits attached as one motion, but is albeit missing from the
electronic case docket. All undocketed filings that have been accepted by
the court but remain missing from the re:Search Texas platform or that have
been served to the respondent and are missing from the re:Search Texas
platform have been attached hereto as Exhibit 4. Click for reference. E.
APPLICATION OF CANON 3 AND REMEDIAL ACTION The actions of Judges
Munford and Judge Kaitcer demonstrate a clear departure from the
standards of impartiality and integrity mandated by Canon 3 of the Texas
Code of Judicial Conduct. The facts before this court reveal a pattern of
procedural inconsistencies and biased decision-making that stem, in large
part, from the Petitioner’s misleading tactics—an influence that these judges
have inadvertently allowed to impact their rulings. Even though such
information may have been obtained during the proceedings, that
information was kept private and never disclosed or entered into the record,
leaving an appearance of impartiality, which is enough to warrant recusal.
See Rogers v. Bradley, 909 S.W.2d 872, 873 (Tex.1995) (“Declaration of
Recusal” by 7 Gammage, J.) (noting that issue is one of perception).
“[B]eyond the demand that a judge be impartial is the requirement that
judge appear to be impartial so that no doubts or suspicions exist as to the
fairness or integrity of the court.”; see also Sears v. Olivarez, 28 S.W.3d 611,

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
613–14 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 2000, no pet.). The facts outlined above
raise serious doubts to these requirements. Under Canon 3(B), judges are
required to adjudicate based on impartiality and factual accuracy. However,
the judges’ failure to critically assess the Petitioner’s narrative of hardship,
coupled with improper handling of filings, has resulted in decisions that lack
factual support and undermine the Respondent's rights to a fair hearing.
This court now has the opportunity to address this lapse by recusing the
judges and ensuring the case is overseen with genuine impartiality. Canon
3(C) underscores the judges' responsibility to administer the court’s
operations consistently and transparently. The irregular handling of critical
filings— orders forwarded without proper certificates of service,
mismanagement within the EFM system, and discrepancies in access—
demonstrate a failure in maintaining the procedural integrity essential to a
fair process. These administrative oversights have obstructed the
Respondent’s access to justice, and this court now has both the facts and the
authority to remedy this. Finally, Canon 3(D) obligates this court to take
appropriate action if it is established that a violation has occurred within the
code. The Respondent believes that the violation is merely a product of
relying on fraudulent pleadings by the Petitioner 8 mixed with permitting a
likely unauthorized attorney to prosecute the case and does not reflect on
either Judge Munford or Judge Kaitcer’s overall fitness for office. F. A
CLOSER LOOK AT CANON 3(D)(2) A judge who receives information clearly
establishing that a lawyer has committed a violation of the Texas
Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct should take appropriate action.
To assist in this determination, notwithstanding the current challenge to Ms.
Carter’s authority, one needs to look no further than the current temporary
orders in place, which is attached as Exhibit I in the original joint motion to
recuse filed on October 7, 2024. On page 1, the orders read: “On February
1, 2024, the Court heard Petitioner's motion for temporary orders.” A review
of the record will show that no motion for temporary orders has been served
to the Respondent in this matter, no notice of hearing was served to the
parties regarding such a motion, and no hearing ever occurred regarding
this motion. The orders move on to state that both parties “appeared by
counsel and announced ready” and “signed an agreed associate judge’s
report” when in fact, both parties appeared, but were rushed into a
settlement agreement by the Respondent’s prior counsel due to his
unwillingness to remain in the courthouse all day, leading to his termination.
Steve Myers, a witness, was present in the conference room during this
exchange. Neither party went before the judge on February 1st, 2024. See
Exhibit 6. 9 21. The agreement, which can be found in Exhibit E in the
original joint motion to recuse, had the following provisions at the bottom of
page 5 of the agreement: “A typed written Order conforming to this Report
will follow within 20 days from the date this Report is signed. The
Temporary Order shall be prepared by Dan Bacalis. Each attorney should
approve the Order. The parties do not need to approve the Order. The
attorney reviewing the proposed Order shall have five (5) days to do so.
There are no ten (10) day letters. If an agreement is not reached, a Motion
to Sign shall be filed and set within thirty (30) days from the signing of this
Report.” Given that an agreement was clearly not reached, the orders were
reduced to writing well beyond the 20 day requirement, the orders were not
prepared by Dan Bacalis, no motion to sign was filed, and the Respondent
was not given 5 days to review the orders, it calls into question as to how

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
they were permitted to be rendered despite lacking the Respondent’s
signature and despite being served to him immediately prior to a hearing
scheduled to challenge their legal foundation. Notwithstanding the above,
the mere fact that the orders state “[t]he parties have agreed to the terms of
this order as evidenced by the signatures below.” and no signature from the
Respondent is present showcases a pre-determined outcome, and a one-
sided favoritism that warrants recusal. Finally, and most concerning, is the
fact that Judge Jeff Kaitcer affixed his signature to this document which
states that “[t]he Court, after examining the record and the agreement of
the parties and hearing the evidence and argument of counsel, finds that 10 
all necessary prerequisites of the law have been legally satisfied and that
the Court has jurisdiction of this case and of all the parties.” The foregoing
statement can’t possibly be true for two reasons. 1) No evidence has been
admitted into this case, and no argument from counsel was presented – only
baseless objections without foundation. 2) The associate judge could not
have possibly examined the record, because it is apparent that consent was
not present at the time of rendition, and the directives he ordered within the
agreement were not followed. Expanding on point 2 above, the associate
judge could not possibly have examined the record because in the original
answer to the protective order filed by the Respondent, he claimed duress as
an affirmative defense alongside fraud and illegality. See Exhibit 7. There
can be no claim of duress unless the following elements are present: (1) a
threat or action taken without legal justification; (2) the threat or action was
of such a character as to destroy the other party's free agency; (3) the threat
or action overcame the opposing party's free will, causing them to do
something they would not otherwise have done and were not legally bound
to do; (4) the restraint was imminent; and (5) the opposing party had no
present means of protection (McMahan v. Greenwood, 108 S.W.3d 467, 482
(Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2003, pet. denied)). 11 28. The Petitioner’s
actions—including seeking an emergency ex parte order, initiating an
eviction, filing for divorce, and pursuing an additional protective order—
occurred within an 8-day span, representing actions taken without legal
justification. These actions threatened the Respondent’s livelihood by
removing him from the residence he needed to provide for his children, as
well as from the home where his children had been raised with their father.
This threat materialized on January 16, 2024, when the Respondent was
ordered to vacate the residence without justification. These actions forced
the Respondent to sign an agreement he would not have otherwise
accepted. This agreement allowed him to return to the residence but
involved conditions that removed his children from their home and was
under no legal obligation to settle given the circumstances of the case and
the baselessness of the claims made against him. If the Respondent did not
sign, he would have faced no alternative other than continued exclusion
from his residence and further impairment of his ability to provide for his
children. This threat was imminent. The Respondent’s counsel advised him
to sign the agreement instead of proceeding to a hearing, leaving him
without a viable means of protection at that time. All elements of duress
were present when the Respondent signed the agreement. Judge Kaitcer
and Ms. Carter were aware that consent was not present when 12 the
orders were rendered yet were entered regardless. This disregard for
procedural fairness and apparent partiality underscores the need for
recusal. Finally, Ms. Carter signed a pleading containing false statements, in

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
violation of Rule 4.01(a) of the Texas Rules of Disciplinary Conduct. She
claimed that the Respondent agreed to the orders, that they were based on a
hearing that never occurred, and referenced a motion never served to the
Respondent. This court should address these actions in accordance with
Canon 3(D)(2) of the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct. G. FINAL THOUGHTS
According to Tex. R. Civ. P. 21(d)(a)(1), a "court proceeding" includes any
appearance before the court, such as a hearing or trial. Per Tex. R. Civ. P.
21(a), every pleading, plea, motion, or application to the court for an order—
whether presented as a motion, plea, or other request—must be filed with
the court clerk in writing, state the grounds, and be noted on the docket
unless presented during a hearing or trial. Should this matter proceed to a
hearing, the court must adhere to the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure,
including docketing all missing items listed in Exhibit 4 and following the
service requirements in Rule 21a when scheduling the hearing. Informal
notices via email only obscure the opportunity for an appeal and fail to
comply with Texas Civil Procedure. The court cannot continue to overlook its
duty to correct these oversights, nor can it ignore state laws to uphold
decisions lacking any legal justification. 13 37. It is deeply troubling that
the Respondent, a self-represented litigant, must underscore basic
procedural requirements to ensure adherence to standard rules, while the
Petitioner’s attorney has repeatedly disregarded these processes by raising
baseless objections in proceedings yet remaining silent in the record. This
absence of accountability raises questions about the attorney’s commitment
to ethical standards and procedural integrity, and it is perplexing that any
reviewing judge could ignore the severity of the issues documented in this
brief. It remains unanswered how a citizen of this state can be removed from
his home and stripped of custody of his children based solely on unproven
accusations by the other parent, without the opportunity to defend himself.
Our society—and especially our children—should not be subjected to this
level of disregard by elected officials. When such actions come from a
vindictive parent willing to falsify their financial status and weave a false
narrative for protection, the court should take appropriate action to prevent
such deceptive actions from occurring in the future, and should surely be a
factor in determining their fitness as a parent. IV. CONCLUSION Recusing
Judges Munford and Kaitcer is the first step to restore the Respondent’s
rights as all other state remedies have been exhausted. These are essential
first steps this court can now take. These actions will not only uphold Canon
3(D)’s standards but will also correct procedural injustices, ensuring that
the case can proceed in alignment with 14 the highest principles of fairness
and impartiality. Such measures will allow new judges to enter the case and
review the facts unobscured by the intentional deceptions that have
compromised these proceedings, ultimately protecting the children’s best
interests as mandated by the Texas Family Code. Given the court’s decision
to stop docketing pleadings at the time the recusal motion was filed, along
with its handling of the matter outside established legal standards, any
reasonable member of the public, fully informed of the facts, would
reasonably question whether the judges were acting impartially in this case.
Such impartiality has rewarded a mother that has fabricated not only her
financial status to this court, but also a false need for protection that should
be taken as serious violations that are apparent from the face of her
pleadings. To continuously deprive a parent of his constitutionally protected
rights to his children and residency despite being given every opportunity to

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
correct the situation showcases a blatant refusal by the current judges to
either fix the situation or provide legal justification for their decisions.
Without a factual basis or explanation for the court’s decisions, they must be
recused so that the truth of the matter may be addressed after ten wasted
months. The court must not tolerate the levels of deception and fraud
committed by the Petitioner, and the Respondent reiterates that despite the
egregious acts taken against him in totality, he holds no ill will toward any
participant in this matter, and solely seeks a just and swift resolution for the
sake of his children. 15 V. PRAYER The respondent respectfully requests
the following relief from this court: Immediately recuse both judge James
Munford and Jeff Kaitcer from this matter by a date deemed appropriate by
the court should no response be filed from the opposing party in opposition
to the relief requested herein. Require that the clerk of the court docket the
missing documents in accordance with the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure
21a found in Exhibit 4.Click for reference. Take judicial notice of the
Petitioner’s deception by examining her pleadings and the effects it has had
on the case. Take judicial notice of the effort put forth by the Respondent to
correct this situation and the lack thereof from the opposing party. Pre-
admit all exhibits attached hereto, and all exhibits found within the original
Joint Motion to Recuse, attached to this envelope as a separate lead
document to prevent confusion when referencing exhibits. Adopt the
Respondent’s First Amended Motion for Temporary Orders attached hereto
as Exhibit 5 and take judicial notice of the Respondent’s parenting plan,
attached as Exhibit L in the original joint motion to recuse and admit both
into evidence. 16 7. Award any other extraordinary relief deemed
appropriate and necessary by the court given the circumstances presented.

Pro-se 817-507-6562 Chuckdustin12@gmail.com 17 AFFIDAVIT OF
CHARLES MYERS STATE OF TEXAS COUNTY OF TARRANT BEFORE ME,
the undersigned authority, on this day personally appeared Charles Dustin
Myers, who, after being duly sworn, did depose and state as follows:
Introduction and Background My name is Charles Dustin Myers, and I am
the Respondent in the case No. 322- 744263-23 & No. 322-744538-23, In the
Matter of the Marriage of Morgan Michelle Myers & Charles Dustin Myers
and in the Interest of M.E.M. & C.R.M., Minor Children, currently pending
in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County, Texas. I am above 18 years of
age, competent to make this affidavit, and have personal knowledge of the
facts stated herein, which are true and correct. Procedural Violations and
Due Process Concerns Since the initiation of this case, I have encountered
numerous procedural irregularities that have obstructed my right to a fair
hearing. I was removed from my residence and separated from my children
on January 16, 2024, based solely on allegations made by the Petitioner,
without any evidentiary findings or an opportunity to defend myself in a
formal hearing. This deprivation of my rights was executed without
adherence to the foundational principles of due process. Duress in Signing
the February 1, 2024, Agreement On February 1, 2024, I was compelled to
sign an agreement that I did not fully 18 understand nor agree with. This
agreement allowed me limited access back into my residence but resulted in
the removal of my children from their home. My decision to sign was made
under duress, as I was advised by my attorney to accept these terms rather
than proceed to a hearing, due to the potential of further exclusion from my
home and livelihood. I felt I had no other viable option to safeguard my

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
ability to continue providing for my children. Bias and Lack of Impartiality I
have serious concerns regarding the impartiality of Judges Munford and
Kaitcer, as the procedural management of this case has shown a consistent
disregard for my rights. My filings and objections have been met with
resistance and have often been undocketed or handled irregularly, while the
Petitioner’s pleadings have proceeded unchecked, despite containing
misleading and unsubstantiated claims. This pattern of favoritism and
procedural leniency towards the Petitioner has compromised the integrity of
these proceedings. Misrepresentation and Lack of Consent in Orders The
current orders on record falsely state that both parties appeared before the
court on February 1, 2024, announced readiness, and signed an agreed
associate judge’s report. In reality, there was no formal hearing or review of
evidence on that date, and I did not give my consent to the terms as
recorded. Furthermore, the orders assert that necessary legal prerequisites
were met, when, in fact, no such procedural steps were observed. These
inaccuracies directly impact my rights and the fairness of these proceedings.
19 6. Unethical Conduct and Professional Misconduct The Petitioner’s
counsel, Ms. Carter, signed and submitted pleadings containing false
statements, misrepresenting my consent to the orders and claiming that a
hearing had occurred when it had not. This conduct violates Rule 4.01(a) of
the Texas Rules of Disciplinary Conduct and Canon 3(D)(2) of the Texas
Code of Judicial Conduct. Such behavior not only misleads the court but also
deprives me of a fair and just resolution. Need for Recusal Given these
procedural irregularities, false representations, and lack of impartiality
demonstrated by Judges Munford and Kaitcer, I respectfully request their
recusal from this case. Their actions and the management of this case have
created an appearance of partiality, depriving me of my right to due process
and casting doubt on the integrity of these proceedings. Request for Judicial
Review and Corrective Action I request that this court take immediate action
to address the procedural oversights, docket missing filings as per Texas
Rules of Civil Procedure, and ensure an impartial review of the facts in this
case. I seek a fair hearing, free from bias, where the truth can be assessed
without obstruction. In the interest of justice, I also urge the court to
examine the Petitioner’s documented misrepresentations and their impact
on the well-being of my children, M.E.M. and C.R.M. 20 9. Conclusion This
affidavit is submitted with sincere intent to restore fairness and procedural
integrity to these proceedings, not out of malice or animosity toward any
individual involved. My only goal is to reach a resolution that genuinely
considers the best interests of my children and respects my constitutional
rights as a parent. I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is
true and correct. X___________________ CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS

322-744263-23 IN THE 322ND DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY,
TEXAS IN THE MATTER OF THE MARRIAGE OF MORGAN MICHELLE
MYERS AND CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS OBJECTION AND REQUEST AND
IN THE INTEREST OF MARA MYERS AND CAROLINE MYERS, CHILDREN
TO DOCKET Respondent respectfully objects to the handling of the case
documents regarding the joint motion to recuse filed on October 7th, 2024
for the foregoing reasons: I. FAILURE TO DOCKET Respondent’s motion to
recuse has not been docketed on the research Texas platform. Metadata
from the efile Texas platform shows the last docketed pleading to be the
Respondent’s Proposed Order on Rule 12 Motion (id #
7f9852d3f4205e0083d02b0536696131) See attached Exhibit A. The
correspondence to Regional Judge David Evans from District Judge James
Munford has not been docketed. The amended order of referral signed on
October 9th, 2024, by District Judge James Munford has not been docketed. 
4. The correspondence and order of referral to Regional Judge David Evans
from Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer signed October 10th, 2024, has not
been docketed. II. RELEVANT COURT RULES According to Rule 25 and
Rule 26 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, the clerk is required to
maintain a file docket and a court docket that record all filings, motions,
orders, and proceedings in a case. The failure to properly docket these
documents violates these rules and further compromises the integrity of the
case record. III. INCONSISTENT RESPONSES AND FAILURE TO FOLLOW
PROTOCOL The Respondent was initially informed via email that the
exhibits and affidavits had been filed. However, after the Respondent
pointed out discrepancies in file size, the explanation changed to the

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
document being too large. This inconsistency raises concerns about
transparency and procedural fairness. Exhibit B As outlined in the Tarrant
County FAQ, Respondent's original submission of 20 MB was well within the
36 MB limit, and the Respondent followed all proper e-filing procedures.
Despite this, the filing was forwarded to the regional judge without the
exhibits and affidavits and later split into three sections due to the supposed
size limit— yet the documents were never subsequently docketed. IV. THE
ONLY RECEIPT CONTAINS THE INCORRECT PLEADNIGS 8. Despite the
emails sent to the Respondent from the court coordinator Lindsey Baker,
there is no official receipt that the correct motion, as filed, was delivered to
the regional judge from either respondent. The motion as originally filed was
modified for reasons that did not remain persistent. The reasoning given
related to file size contradicts the FAQ from the Tarrant County District
Clerk. If a separate system is used to forward these files to the Regional
Judge, the Respondent respectfully requests that this be clarified given the
severity of the situation. CONCLUSION AND REQUEST Given the persistent
inconsistencies, failure to properly docket the Respondent's filings, and the
lack of transparency surrounding the handling of crucial case documents,
Respondent Charles Dustin Myers formally objects to the actions of the
322nd District Court and requests immediate correction of the docketing
failures. Furthermore, Respondent requests validation that the correct
motions and accompanying exhibits were forwarded to the regional judge as
originally filed. The files officially served to the Respondent via eFile do not
contain the original joint motion. In light of these ongoing procedural issues,
Respondent reserves the right to seek further remedies unless proper
procedural requirements are followed to ensure equal protection under the
United States Constitution. Respectfully submitted, /s/ Charles Dustin

THOMAS A. WILDER DISTRICT CLERK NO. 322-744263-23 IN THE 322ND
DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS IN THE MATTER OF THE
MARRIAGE OF MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS AND CHARLES DUSTIN
MYERS First Amended Motion for Temporary Orders AND IN THE
INTEREST OF M M CHILDREN AND C M EXPEDITED RELIEF
REQUESTED BY OCTOBER 1ST, 2024 09/27/2024 FOREWORD On January
16th, 2024, amid inclement weather, the Respondent was ordered to vacate
the residency at a show cause hearing for an order of protection where a
continuance was granted, and cause number 322-744263-23 was
consolidated with cause number 322-744538-23 on the court’s own motion,
and the case was reset to January 22nd, 2024, and then again for February
1st, 2024, where a settlement agreement was quickly drafted and
Respondent was advised to sign it by his former counsel. This led to the
subsequent termination of counsel, leaving Respondent to request an
emergency hearing to vacate the associate judge’s report for temporary
orders, which was the only hearing to date in this case after eight months.
The unusual circumstances surrounding the initiation of this case warrant
the court's reconsideration of the Respondent's original answer and
subsequent briefs1 filed before the initial setting. Given the evolving facts
and the clear foresight demonstrated in these earlier submissions,
Respondent respectfully urges the court to revisit these filings in the

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
interest of ensuring a just resolution. 1 THIS PLEADING IS INTERACTIVE
AND BOOKMARKED FOR THE COURT'S CONVENIENCE FIRST
AMENDEDMOTION FOR TEMPORARY ORDERS Pursuant to Texas Family

MYERS, or any third party acting on her behalf or with knowledge of this
case, from disturbing the peace and well-being of the minor children, M E M

6.501 Temporary Restraining Order Respondent respectfully requests that
the court grant the following temporary restraining order without notice
against the Petitioner in this matter: 2 C. Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN
MYERS, asks the court to grant the following temporary restraining order
against the Petitioner, MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS for the preservation of
the property at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, TX 76148 and for the protection
of the parties, prohibiting Petitioner, MORGAN AND CHARLES MYERS,

with intent to annoy or alarm the other party; (ii) threatening the other party
in person or in any other manner, including by telephone or another
electronic voice transmission, video chat, in writing, or electronic
messaging, to take unlawful action against any person, intending by this
action to annoy or alarm the other party; (iii) placing a telephone call,
anonymously, at an unreasonable hour, in an offensive and repetitious
manner, or without a legitimate purpose of communication with the intent to
annoy or alarm the other party; (iv) intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly
causing bodily injury to the other party or to a child of either party; 3 (v)
threatening the other party or a child of either party with imminent bodily
injury; (vi) intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly destroying, removing,
concealing, encumbering, transferring, or otherwise harming or reducing

the authority of the court to order a division of the estate of the parties in a
manner that the court deems just and right, having due regard for the rights
of each party and any children of the marriage; (vii) intentionally falsifying a
writing or record, including an electronic record, relating to the property of

Code §§ 6.503 AFFIDAVIT, VERIFIED PLEADING, AND BOND NOT
REQUIRED D. Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS requests the court
issue the above orders without notice and hearing and in the absence of a
verified pleading, affidavit, and dispense with the necessity of a bond on
behalf of the parties, their children, and the protection of their property in
connection with these orders pursuant to the Texas Family Code, section
6.503 without notice and hearing. 5 4. Extraordinary relief E. Given the
extraordinary circumstances of this case, Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN
MYERS, requests that the court order his return to the residency, where he
will resume rent payments and begin transitioning and recovering from the
ongoing deprivation that has lasted throughout the case. The Respondent
has attached a proposed parenting plan which was overlooked on January
16th, 2024, when this court decided to order him to vacate the residency
which he requires to financially support the Children during the pendency of
the case. F. Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS further requests that
the court vacate the orders currently in place sua sponte replacing them
with the current orders, which will allow him to withdraw his Motion for
Rehearing in the Supreme Court of Texas. Cause no. 24-0395. G. The
Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS prays the Court will take swift
action and intends to demonstrate through his actions how these orders suit
the best interests of the children in this case. H. The Respondent
respectfully requests expedited action on this motion by October 1st, 2024,
as he will be forced to temporarily relocate to Denton, Texas pending relief,
which will further exacerbate the situation and will further separate him
from his children. 6 CONCLUSION i. The Petitioner appeared before this
Court on December 14, 2023, requesting an ex-parte temporary order of
protection, and subsequently filed a protective order on December 22, 2023.
The Respondent contends that the Petitioner's narrative is an attempt to
avoid accountability for her extramarital affairs which was discovered just
prior to the initiation of her pleadings. ii. While the Petitioner engaged in
activities outside the marriage, the Respondent remained at home caring for
the children. During the time the Petitioner pursued legal actions shortly
before Christmas, the Respondent was preparing for the children's holiday.
Since taking residence in the family home, the Petitioner has reportedly
moved in her sister, reduced her employment to three hours per day, failed
to complete the court-ordered parenting course, and is not contributing rent
to her grandmother. The Respondent asserts that there is sufficient evidence
on record to substantiate these claims, and predicted this exact outcome
within his first pleadings within the clerk’s record, attached hereto. iii. The
Respondent believes that this case has been conducted in the best interest
of the Petitioner rather than the children, a concern that has been

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
repeatedly raised without response. The current orders in place are lack
lawful foundation, and there has been minimal meaningful engagement from
the Petitioner's attorney. The Respondent is concerned about the ongoing
financial 7 erosion affecting the children's well-being and sees no logical
basis to consider the existing arrangements as serving their best interests.
iv. Granting this motion would initiate a long-overdue healing process. The
Petitioner should be required to explain her actions and be held
accountable. The Respondent emphasizes the critical need for access to the
residence to provide for the children while seeking alternative
accommodations nearby. This need is argued to take precedence over the
Petitioner's desire to protect herself from the consequences of her own
actions. v. The Respondent respectfully urges the Court to intervene and
make a decision that genuinely serves the best interests of the children. vi.
If anything else – the orders currently in place show the truth. Mother can’t
pay rent, hasn’t completed her responsibilities for the Children, and has
reduced her employment. Father has followed all aspects of the orders that
he is able to given the circumstances. vii. So long as the Children are in
Father’s care and he is given a fair amount of time to transition from the
residency to ensure that he may still provide for his Children financially
while the case is pending, the status quo will be maintained. viii. Father has
overwhelming evidence to support all claims herein, already served to
Petitioner, and without response, and already on the record. Respondent
prays that this Court will consider the totality of the case, and grant this
motion to rightfully restore the status quo. 8 PRAYER FOR EXPEDITED
RELIEF Respondent requests the following expedited relief: Vacate the
current orders, which were entered in violation of the Respondent's right to
due process and a fair hearing. These orders were rendered as "agreed"
without the Respondent's consent and are unsupported by any motion that
was properly served on him. Grant the Respondent's motion for temporary
orders without notice or hearing to the Petitioner, restoring the status quo
for the children and enabling the Respondent to meet his financial
obligations related to the Children and allow healing to begin. Provide a
provision allowing the Respondent to return to the residence at 6641 Anne
Court, Watauga, TX 76148 where he was wrongfully removed including the
option for Petitioner to reside there as well if she so chooses. Strike all
pleadings from the Respondent other than the Rule 12 motion to show
authority and the summary judgement motion in the interest of judicial
economy. Grant any further relief that this Court finds equitable, just, and
appropriate so that we may finally get this case headed in the right direction
and in alignment with the Children’s best interest. 9 Respectfully

EXHIBIT 6 Affidavit of Steve Myers 
Answer (Texas)
Short response
When all state court remedies have been exhausted in a Texas divorce case
marked by alleged judicial bias, fraudulent settlement, and deprivation of
property rights, the litigant’s remaining options are to pursue recusal or
disqualification of the judge under Texas law, seek federal intervention if
constitutional rights are implicated, and request emergency relief to
preserve property interests pending resolution of related federal claims.
However, the ability to halt a final trial or prevent permanent loss of
property is extremely limited once state remedies are exhausted, and
success depends on strict compliance with procedural requirements and the
availability of extraordinary relief.
Summary
A litigant who has been removed from his home by court order, subjected to
a settlement agreement he did not sign, and denied relief through state
appeals faces a narrow set of procedural and substantive options under
Texas law. The primary remaining state-level remedy is a motion to recuse or
disqualify the presiding judge, which must be supported by specific,
admissible evidence of bias or impropriety and filed at the earliest
practicable time; this can potentially delay proceedings and, if granted, may
result in a new judge reviewing prior rulings. If recusal is denied and all
state remedies are exhausted, the litigant may seek federal court
intervention—such as through a pending RICO action—if there are
substantial constitutional violations, but federal courts are generally
reluctant to interfere with ongoing state domestic relations matters unless
there is clear evidence of federal rights being violated and no adequate state
remedy.
To prevent permanent loss of property interests and stop a final trial, the
litigant should ensure that all procedural objections and motions (including
for recusal, to docket missing filings, and for emergency relief) are properly
preserved in the record, and should consider seeking a stay of state
proceedings from the federal court if the federal claims are inextricably
linked to the state action. However, the threshold for federal intervention is
high, and the state court’s refusal to follow procedural rules or docket
filings, while potentially supporting a claim of due process violation, does

=== PAGE 21 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
not automatically entitle the litigant to relief absent a clear showing of
irreparable harm and lack of any other remedy.
Background and Relevant Law
Texas Law on Recusal and Disqualification
Under Texas law, a judge may be recused or disqualified from a case on the
same grounds and under the same circumstances as specified in the Texas
Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 18b. The relevant administrative code
provision, 1 Tex. Admin. Code § 155.152, requires that a motion to recuse or
disqualify be made at the earliest practicable time, be verified if in writing,
state with particularity the grounds for the motion, and be based on
personal knowledge with facts admissible in evidence, except that facts may
be stated on information and belief if the basis is specifically stated. This
process is designed to ensure impartiality and protect due process rights in
judicial proceedings (1 Tex. Admin. Code § 155.152).
The Texas Code of Judicial Conduct, as referenced in the context, imposes on
judges the duty to perform their adjudicative, administrative, and
disciplinary responsibilities impartially and diligently. Canon 3 requires
judges to avoid bias, ensure all parties are heard, and take action if they
become aware of misconduct by attorneys or other judges. The Texas Rules
of Civil Procedure further require that all pleadings, motions, and orders be
properly filed and docketed, and that service requirements be strictly
followed.
Exhaustion of State Remedies and Federal Intervention
Once all state court remedies have been exhausted—including appeals and
motions for recusal or disqualification—the litigant’s options within the state
system are effectively foreclosed. At this point, if the litigant believes that
his federal constitutional rights (such as due process or equal protection)
have been violated, he may seek relief in federal court. This is particularly
relevant if there is a pending federal RICO action alleging that the divorce
proceedings are the product of racketeering activity.
However, federal courts are generally reluctant to intervene in ongoing state
domestic relations cases under the abstention doctrines (such as Younger
abstention), except in cases where there is no adequate state remedy and
irreparable harm is threatened. The federal court may, in rare
circumstances, issue a stay of state proceedings or grant injunctive relief if
it finds that the state court’s actions violate federal law and that the litigant
has no other means of protecting his rights.

Analysis
1. Motion to Recuse or Disqualify the Judge
The most direct procedural tool available to a litigant who believes the
presiding judge is biased or has acted improperly is a motion to recuse or
disqualify. Under 1 Tex. Admin. Code § 155.152, such a motion must be filed
as soon as possible, be verified, and set forth specific facts supporting the
claim of bias or impropriety. The motion must be based on personal
knowledge and include facts that would be admissible in evidence, or, if
based on information and belief, must state the basis for that belief.
In the present context, the litigant has already filed a joint motion to recuse,
citing numerous procedural irregularities, failure to docket filings, and
evidence of bias. The motion references the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct
and the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and is supported by affidavits and
exhibits. If the motion to recuse is still pending or has not been properly
ruled upon, the litigant should ensure that it is brought to the attention of
the appropriate reviewing authority (such as the regional presiding judge)
and that all supporting evidence is included in the record.
If the motion to recuse is granted, a new judge will be assigned to the case,
who may review prior rulings and potentially correct procedural errors. If
the motion is denied, the litigant may seek review of the denial through
mandamus or interlocutory appeal, but these remedies are limited and
subject to strict procedural requirements.
2. Preservation of Objections and Procedural Rights
To protect property interests and preserve the right to challenge the validity
of the settlement agreement and other orders, the litigant must ensure that
all objections to procedural irregularities, lack of notice, and improper
docketing are clearly stated in the record. This includes filing formal
objections to the handling of filings, requesting that missing documents be
docketed, and challenging the validity of any orders entered without proper
notice or consent.
The litigant’s filings indicate that he has objected to the failure to docket
motions and exhibits, the alteration of filings, and the entry of orders
without his signature or consent. These objections should be reiterated in
any further filings, and the litigant should request that the court take
judicial notice of the procedural deficiencies and the lack of consent to the
settlement agreement.
3. Emergency Relief and Motions to Stay Proceedings
If a final trial is set to proceed despite unresolved issues of judicial bias,
fraudulent settlement, and deprivation of property rights, the litigant may
file an emergency motion to stay the proceedings pending resolution of the
recusal motion or related federal claims. The motion should set forth the
specific grounds for the stay, including the risk of irreparable harm (such as

=== PAGE 23 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
permanent loss of property interests), the pendency of a federal RICO
action, and the need to preserve the status quo.
While the granting of a stay is discretionary, the court may be persuaded to
halt proceedings if there is a credible showing that the litigant’s rights will
be irreparably harmed and that the issues raised are substantial and
unresolved. The motion should be supported by affidavits and documentary
evidence, and should request expedited consideration.
4. Federal Court Intervention
If all state remedies have been exhausted and the state court refuses to
provide relief, the litigant may seek intervention from the federal court,
particularly if there is a pending RICO action alleging that the divorce
proceedings are the product of racketeering activity. The federal court may,
in limited circumstances, issue a stay of the state proceedings or grant
injunctive relief if it finds that the state court’s actions violate federal law
and that the litigant has no other adequate remedy.
However, federal courts are generally reluctant to interfere with ongoing
state domestic relations cases, and will do so only if there is clear evidence
of federal rights being violated and no adequate state remedy. The litigant
must demonstrate that the state court’s actions constitute a violation of due
process or other constitutional rights, and that the harm cannot be remedied
through further state proceedings.
5. Challenging the Validity of the Settlement Agreement
The litigant has alleged that the settlement agreement is fraudulent, lacks
his signature, and was entered under duress. Under Texas law, a settlement
agreement that is not signed by all parties or was entered under duress may
be subject to challenge. The litigant should continue to assert these
defenses in any further proceedings, and should request that the court set
aside the agreement and restore the status quo pending a fair hearing.
If the court refuses to consider these defenses or proceeds to enter a final
judgment based on the disputed agreement, the litigant may raise these
issues on appeal or in a collateral attack, but the likelihood of success
diminishes once a final judgment is entered and all appeals are exhausted.
Exceptions and Caveats
The ability to halt a final trial or prevent permanent loss of property
interests is extremely limited once all state remedies have been exhausted.
Texas law provides for recusal and disqualification of judges, but these
remedies must be pursued promptly and supported by specific evidence. If
the state court refuses to provide relief and all appeals are denied, the
litigant’s only remaining option is to seek federal intervention, which is
rarely granted in domestic relations cases.

=== PAGE 24 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Federal courts will abstain from interfering with state court proceedings
unless there is a clear violation of federal rights and no adequate state
remedy. The pendency of a federal RICO action does not automatically
entitle the litigant to a stay of state proceedings, and the federal court will
consider the specific facts and procedural posture of the case before
granting any relief.
Conclusion
In summary, a litigant in Texas who has been deprived of property rights and
subjected to a fraudulent settlement agreement, and who has exhausted all
state court remedies, may seek recusal or disqualification of the judge under 
1 Tex. Admin. Code § 155.152, preserve all procedural objections in the
record, and request emergency relief to stay proceedings. If these remedies
are denied, the litigant may seek federal court intervention if there is a
substantial federal question and no adequate state remedy, but the threshold
for such relief is high. The best chance of preventing permanent loss of
property interests and stopping a final trial lies in strict compliance with
procedural requirements, timely filing of motions, and clear documentation
of all objections and evidence of bias or impropriety.
Legal Authorities
Sears v. Nueces County Sherriff Olivarez, 28 S.W.3d 611 (Tex. App. 2000)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The Texas Supreme Court mandates that when there exists a reasonable
question as to a judge's impartiality, recusal is mandatory. In determining
whether recusal is required pursuant to Tex.R.Civ.P. 18b(2)(a), the proper
inquiry is whether a reasonable member of the public at large, knowing all
the facts in the public domain would have a reasonable doubt that a judge is
actually impartial. Rodgers v. Bradley, 909 S.W.2d 872, 874 (Tex. 1995).
Summary
The passage highlights the importance of judicial impartiality and the
conditions under which recusal is mandatory. If a litigant can demonstrate
that a judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned, recusal is
required. This could be a strategy for the litigant to pursue if they believe
the judge's actions have been biased or unfair, potentially impacting the
outcome of their case.

Extract
The rule's language is clear, simple and unequivocal: Texas Rule of Appellate
Procedure 15a provides that an appellate judge 'shall disqualify or recuse
himself in any proceeding in which judges must disqualify themselves under
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18b....' Rule 18b provides in relevant part that
a judge 'shall recuse himself in any proceeding in which ... his impartiality
might reasonably be questioned.' Tex.R.Civ.P. 18b(2)(a). The language is
imperative and mandatory, not permissive or discretionary; the standard is
objective, not subjective.
Summary
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18b mandates that a judge must recuse
themselves if their impartiality might reasonably be questioned. This is an
objective standard, meaning it is based on how a reasonable person would
view the situation, not on the judge's personal feelings or beliefs.
1 Tex. Admin. Code § 155.152 1 Tex. Admin. Code § 155.152 Disqualification
Or Recusal of Judges
Extract
A judge is subject to recusal or disqualification on the same grounds and
under the same circumstances as specified in TRCP Rule 18b. Motion. A
motion to recuse or disqualify a judge assigned to a case should: (A) be
made at the earliest practicable time; (B) be verified, if the motion is in
writing; (C) state with particularity the grounds for the motion; and (D) be
based on personal knowledge and include such facts as would be admissible
in evidence, except that facts may be stated on information and belief if the
basis for such belief is specifically stated.
Summary
The passage provides guidance on how a litigant can file a motion to recuse
or disqualify a judge, which could be a strategic move to prevent a biased
trial and potentially delay proceedings. This is relevant to the litigant's
situation as it offers a procedural step that can be taken even when other
state court options are exhausted.

Order
Extract
After the filing of a suit for dissolution of a marriage, on the motion of a
party or on the court's own motion, the court may grant a temporary

=== PAGE 26 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
restraining order without notice to the adverse party for the preservation of
the property and for the protection of the parties as necessary, including an
order prohibiting one or both parties from... intentionally, knowingly, or
recklessly destroying, removing, concealing, encumbering, transferring, or
otherwise harming or reducing the value of the property of the parties or
either party with intent to obstruct the authority of the court to order a
division of the estate of the parties in a manner that the court deems just
and right, having due regard for the rights of each party and any children of
the marriage.
Summary
A court may issue a temporary restraining order to prevent the destruction
or transfer of property during divorce proceedings. This can be a crucial
step for a litigant seeking to prevent permanent loss of property interests,
especially when other state court options are exhausted. The restraining
order can help maintain the status quo and protect the litigant's property
rights while pursuing concurrent legal actions, such as a RICO case in
federal court.
