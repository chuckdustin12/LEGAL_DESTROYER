Question
In a divorce proceeding that has not been finalized, if a third party
fraudulently induces the court to issue an order (such as requiring the
husband to vacate the marital home) based on fraudulent information, is the
resulting harm to the husband legally attributable to the third party's fraud
or to the court's order?
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
The resulting harm to the husband is legally attributable to the third party's
fraud rather than to the court's order, as private parties who fraudulently
induce judicial action can be held liable for damages while the court itself is
protected by judicial immunity. This legal attribution reflects the principle
that judicial immunity does not extend to third parties who corrupt the
judicial process through fraud or conspiracy.
Summary
When a third party fraudulently induces a court to issue an order in a
divorce proceeding based on false information, the legal responsibility for
resulting harm to the affected party (such as a husband forced to vacate the
marital home) falls primarily on the perpetrator of the fraud rather than on
the court itself. This determination stems from two complementary legal
principles: first, that judges generally enjoy absolute immunity from liability
for their judicial acts even when those acts are based on erroneous or
fraudulent information; and second, that private individuals who conspire
with or manipulate judicial proceedings through fraud can be held
independently liable for the resulting damages.
The case law demonstrates a clear distinction between the immunity that
protects the judicial function and the absence of such protection for third
parties who commit fraud upon the court. While the judge's order itself
cannot generally be the basis for liability against the court, the third party
remains answerable for their fraudulent actions that corrupted the judicial
process. This framework preserves the integrity of judicial decision-making
while providing recourse against those who deliberately abuse the court
system through fraudulent representations, ensuring that injured parties
like the husband in a divorce proceeding can seek appropriate remedies
against the actual perpetrators of the fraud.

Background and Relevant Legal Principles
The Doctrine of Judicial Immunity
The American legal system has long recognized that judges enjoy absolute
immunity from civil liability for their judicial actions, even when those
actions result in harm to individuals before the court. This immunity is
extensive and applies regardless of allegations of judicial error, malice, or
corruption.
As established in Pyle v. Hatley, 239 F. Supp. 2d 970 (C.D. Cal. 2002), judicial
immunity applies "however erroneous the act may have been, and however
injurious in its consequences it may have proved to the plaintiff." The court
in Pyle further emphasized that "judicial immunity is not overcome by
allegations of bad faith or malice" and that such immunity "applies even
when the judge is accused of acting maliciously and corruptly." This absolute
immunity "insulates judges from charges of erroneous acts or irregular
actions, even when it is alleged that such action was driven by malicious or
corrupt motives, or when the exercise of judicial authority is 'flawed by the
commission of grave procedural errors.'"
Similarly, the Fifth Circuit in Arsenaux v. Roberts, 726 F.2d 1022 (5th Cir.
1982) reaffirmed that a "judge is absolutely immune from liability for his
judicial acts even if his exercise of authority is flawed by the commission of
grave procedural errors." The court further noted that a judge cannot "be
deprived of immunity because the action [or inaction] he took [or did not
take] was in error, was done maliciously, or was in excess of his authority;
rather, he will be subject to liability only when he has acted in 'clear absence
of all jurisdiction.'"
These principles establish that a court order in a divorce proceeding—such
as requiring a husband to vacate the marital home—would typically be
protected by judicial immunity, even if the order was based on fraudulent
information provided to the court. The judge issuing such an order would
not be personally liable for damages resulting from the order, absent
extraordinary circumstances showing a complete absence of jurisdiction.
Third-Party Liability for Fraud in Judicial Proceedings
While judicial immunity shields the court itself, this protection does not
extend to third parties who commit fraud during judicial proceedings. The
Supreme Court's decision in Dennis v. Sparks, 449 U.S. 24, 101 S.Ct. 183, 66
L.Ed.2d 185 (1980) directly addresses this distinction, holding that "the
judge's immunity from damages liability for an official act that was allegedly
the product of a corrupt conspiracy involving bribery of the judge does not
change the character of his action or that of his co-conspirators."
The Court in Dennis specifically concluded that "private persons, jointly
engaged with state officials in a challenged action, are acting 'under color'
of law for purposes of § 1983 actions" and that "historically at common law,
judicial immunity does not insulate from damages liability those private

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
persons who corruptly conspire with a judge." This principle establishes that
third parties who fraudulently induce judicial action can be held liable for
the resulting harm, even when the judge is immune.
Professional Ethics Considerations
Legal ethics rules further support the principle that third parties,
particularly attorneys, can be held accountable for fraudulent conduct in
court proceedings. According to 32 C.F.R. § 776.42 (2025), attorneys have an
affirmative duty not to "knowingly make a false statement of material fact or
law to a tribunal or fail to correct a false statement of material fact or law
previously made to the tribunal." The regulation further requires that
attorneys who know "that a person intends to engage, is engaging or has
engaged in criminal or fraudulent conduct related to the proceeding shall
take reasonable remedial measures, including, if necessary, disclosure to the
tribunal."
These ethical obligations indicate that attorneys and other parties who
present fraudulent information to a court can be held professionally and
legally responsible for their conduct, separate from any judicial immunity
that might protect the court's actions.
Defining Fraud Upon the Court
Understanding the concept of "fraud upon the court" is crucial for
determining liability in cases involving fraudulent information presented
during judicial proceedings. In Travelers Indem. Co. v. Gore, 761 F.2d 1549
(11th Cir. 1985), the court defined fraud upon the court as "that species of
fraud which does or attempts to, defile the court itself, or is a fraud
perpetrated by officers of the court so that the judicial machinery cannot
perform in the usual manner its impartial task of adjudging cases."
The Travelers court distinguished between "fraud upon the court" and
"fraud inter parties," noting that "fraud inter parties, without more, should
not be fraud upon the court, but redress should be left to a motion under
Rule 60(b)(3) or to an independent action." This distinction suggests that
different legal remedies may be available depending on the nature and
extent of the fraudulent conduct.
Extrinsic vs. Intrinsic Fraud
The Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Throckmorton, 98 U.S. 61,
25 L.Ed. 93 (1878) established an important distinction between extrinsic
and intrinsic fraud in judicial proceedings. The Court held that "the acts for
which a court of equity will on account of fraud set aside or annul a
judgment or decree, between the same parties, rendered by a court of
competent jurisdiction, have relation to frauds, extrinsic or collateral, to the
matter tried by the first court, and not to a fraud in the matter on which the
decree was rendered."
It is important to note that Throckmorton has been stated as overruled by 
Averbach v. Rival Mfg. Co., 809 F.2d 1016 (3rd Cir. 1987). This subsequent

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
treatment suggests that the strict distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic
fraud may no longer be as determinative as it once was. However, the
concept remains relevant to understanding how courts approach fraud in
judicial proceedings.
The more recent case of Scott v. Byrd, 8:25-cv-1342-KKM-AEP (M.D. Fla. Jun
11, 2025) refers to Throckmorton's holding that "for fraud to lay a
foundation for an independent action, it must be such that it was not in issue
in the former action nor could it have been put in issue by the reasonable
diligence of the opposing party." This suggests that despite Throckmorton's
partial overruling, courts still consider whether fraudulent conduct could
have been discovered and addressed in the original proceeding when
determining appropriate remedies.
Analysis: Attribution of Legal Liability for
Harm
Judicial Immunity Shields the Court's Order, Not Third-
Party Fraud
When analyzing whether harm from a court order based on fraudulent
information is attributable to the third party's fraud or to the court's order
itself, the doctrine of judicial immunity provides a clear starting point. The
extensive immunity granted to judges for their judicial acts means that the
legal system generally does not attribute liability to the court or judge for
issuing an order, even if that order causes harm and was based on false
information.
The cases cited above establish that judicial immunity applies "however
erroneous the act may have been, and however injurious in its
consequences" (Pyle v. Hatley, 239 F. Supp. 2d 970 (C.D. Cal. 2002)). This
immunity exists specifically to protect the integrity of the judicial decision-
making process, allowing judges to make decisions without fear of personal
liability.
In practical terms, this means that a husband ordered to vacate the marital
home in a divorce proceeding could not successfully sue the judge or the
court for damages resulting from that order, even if the order was based
entirely on fraudulent information provided by a third party. The judicial
immunity doctrine effectively blocks attribution of legal liability to the
court's order itself.
Third Parties Can Be Held Liable for Fraudulent Conduct
While judicial immunity protects the court, it does not extend to third parties
who commit fraud in judicial proceedings. The Supreme Court's decision in 
Dennis v. Sparks, 449 U.S. 24 (1980) clearly establishes that private
individuals who corrupt judicial proceedings can be held liable for resulting
damages, even when the judge is immune.

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The Court in Dennis specifically held that "the judge's immunity from
damages liability for an official act that was allegedly the product of a
corrupt conspiracy... does not change the character of his action or that of
his co-conspirators." Moreover, "historically at common law, judicial
immunity does not insulate from damages liability those private persons who
corruptly conspire with a judge."
Applied to our divorce proceeding scenario, this means that if a third party
(such as the wife's friend, relative, or attorney) fraudulently induces the
court to issue an order requiring the husband to vacate the marital home,
that third party could potentially be held liable for damages resulting from
their fraudulent conduct, even though the judge who issued the order is
immune.
Professional Ethics Reinforces Third-Party Accountability
The ethical obligations imposed on attorneys further support the principle
that third parties can be held accountable for fraudulent conduct in court
proceedings. Under 32 C.F.R. § 776.42 (2025), attorneys must not knowingly
make false statements to a tribunal and must take remedial measures if they
become aware of fraudulent conduct related to a proceeding.
These ethical requirements suggest that when an attorney or other party
presents fraudulent information to a court, they are violating established
professional standards and can be held accountable for that violation. This
reinforces the principle that legal responsibility for harm resulting from
fraudulently-induced court orders can be attributed to the party committing
the fraud.
Remedies Available Against Third-Party Fraud
When a court order in a divorce proceeding is obtained through fraud, the
injured party has several potential remedies available against the third party
who committed the fraud.
First, as established in Dennis v. Sparks, 449 U.S. 24 (1980), the injured
party may have a cause of action for damages against the third party who
fraudulently induced the court order. This could potentially include
compensation for financial losses, emotional distress, or other harms
resulting from the fraudulent conduct.
Second, the distinction between "fraud upon the court" and "fraud inter
parties" discussed in Travelers Indem. Co. v. Gore, 761 F.2d 1549 (11th Cir.
1985) suggests that different procedural remedies may be available
depending on the nature of the fraud. If the fraudulent conduct constitutes
fraud upon the court (meaning it "defiles the court itself" or is "perpetrated
by officers of the court"), more extensive remedies may be available.
Third, as referenced in Scott v. Byrd, 8:25-cv-1342-KKM-AEP (M.D. Fla. Jun
11, 2025), an independent action based on fraud may be possible if the fraud
"was not in issue in the former action nor could it have been put in issue by
the reasonable diligence of the opposing party." This reflects the principle

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
that if the fraudulent conduct could not have been discovered and addressed
in the original proceeding, additional remedies may be warranted.
The "Fraud Exception" Question
The case of Gilbank v. Wood Cnty. Dep't of Human Servs., 111 F.4th 754 (7th
Cir. 2024) raises an interesting question about the existence of a "fraud
exception" to certain jurisdictional principles. The court notes that while it
has overruled a "corruption exception," it "expressly left open the status of a
fraud exception, noting the tension in this circuit's case law on that subject."
While Gilbank does not definitively resolve this question, it suggests that
courts continue to grapple with how to address fraud in judicial
proceedings. The case acknowledges that previous interpretations
"extending judicial corruption reasoning to third-party fraud claims may be
mistaken," but does not provide a clear answer on whether harm resulting
from third-party fraud is attributable to the fraud or the court's order.
This ongoing legal uncertainty reinforces the importance of focusing on
established principles—namely, that judicial immunity protects the court but
not third parties who commit fraud, and that legal remedies are available
against those third parties.
Exceptions and Limitations
Limited Exceptions to Judicial Immunity
While judicial immunity is broad, it is not absolute. According to Arsenaux v.
Roberts, 726 F.2d 1022 (5th Cir. 1982), a judge "will be subject to liability
only when he has acted in 'clear absence of all jurisdiction.'" This extremely
narrow exception means that in rare cases where a judge acts completely
outside their jurisdiction, judicial immunity might not apply.
However, this exception would rarely be relevant in a divorce proceeding
where the court generally has clear jurisdiction to issue orders regarding
marital property and living arrangements. Therefore, in most cases involving
fraudulently-induced orders in divorce proceedings, judicial immunity would
still protect the court from liability.
Challenges in Establishing Third-Party Liability
While third parties can be held liable for fraudulent conduct in judicial
proceedings, establishing such liability may present practical challenges.
The injured party would need to prove that the third party knowingly
presented false information to the court and that this fraudulent information
directly caused the court to issue the harmful order.
Additionally, as suggested by United States v. Throckmorton, 98 U.S. 61
(1878) and its subsequent treatment, courts may consider whether the fraud
was extrinsic or intrinsic to the original proceeding and whether it could
have been discovered and addressed at that time. Although Throckmorton

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
has been partially overruled, as noted in Averbach, these considerations may
still impact the available remedies.
Scott v. Byrd, 8:25-cv-1342-KKM-AEP (M.D. Fla. Jun 11, 2025) reiterates that
"for fraud to lay a foundation for an independent action, it must be such that
it was not in issue in the former action nor could it have been put in issue by
the reasonable diligence of the opposing party." This suggests that if the
husband in a divorce proceeding could have discovered and challenged the
fraudulent information during the original proceeding, his ability to bring a
subsequent action based on that fraud might be limited.
Conclusion
Based on the legal authorities provided, the harm resulting from a court
order in a divorce proceeding that was based on fraudulent information
would be legally attributable primarily to the third party's fraud rather than
to the court's order itself. This conclusion is supported by several key
principles:
Judicial immunity protects judges from liability for their judicial acts,
even when those acts are based on erroneous or fraudulent
information. As established in Pyle v. Hatley, 239 F. Supp. 2d 970 (C.D.
Cal. 2002), this immunity applies "however erroneous the act may have
been, and however injurious in its consequences it may have proved to
the plaintiff."
Judicial immunity does not extend to third parties who commit fraud in
judicial proceedings. The Supreme Court in Dennis v. Sparks, 449 U.S.
24 (1980) clearly held that "the judge's immunity from damages liability
for an official act that was allegedly the product of a corrupt
conspiracy... does not change the character of his action or that of his
co-conspirators" and that "historically at common law, judicial immunity
does not insulate from damages liability those private persons who
corruptly conspire with a judge."
Professional ethics standards reinforce the principle that parties who
present fraudulent information to a court can be held accountable for
their conduct. According to 32 C.F.R. § 776.42 (2025), attorneys must
not knowingly make false statements to a tribunal and must take
remedial measures if they become aware of fraudulent conduct related
to a proceeding.
Various legal remedies are available against third parties who commit
fraud in judicial proceedings, including potential actions for damages
and motions to set aside fraudulently-obtained orders.
In the specific context of a divorce proceeding where a third party
fraudulently induces the court to issue an order requiring the husband to
vacate the marital home, the husband would generally not be able to hold
the court liable due to judicial immunity. However, he could potentially
pursue legal action against the third party who committed the fraud, seeking
damages and other appropriate remedies.

This attribution of legal responsibility to the third party rather than to the
court serves important policy goals: it preserves the integrity of judicial
decision-making by maintaining judicial immunity, while also providing
accountability and potential remedies for those harmed by fraudulent
conduct in judicial proceedings.
Legal Authorities
Dennis v. Sparks, 449 U.S. 24, 101 S.Ct. 183, 66 L.Ed.2d 185 (1980)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
Held: The action against the private parties accused of conspiring with the
judge is not subject to dismissal. Private persons, jointly engaged with state
officials in a challenged action, are acting 'under color' of law for purposes
of § 1983 actions. And the judge's immunity from damages liability for an
official act that was allegedly the product of a corrupt conspiracy involving
bribery of the judge does not change the character of his action or that of
his co-conspirators. Historically at common law, judicial immunity does not
insulate from damages liability those private persons who corruptly conspire
with a judge.
Summary
Private parties who conspire with a judge to produce a fraudulent court
order can be held liable for damages. The judge's immunity does not extend
to these private parties, and their actions are considered to be under color
of state law. This indicates that the harm resulting from a fraudulent court
order can be legally attributed to the third party's fraud, rather than solely
to the court's order.

Scott makes several arguments in response. First, she contends that judicial
immunity does not apply because the judges acted based on fraud and
without due process, citing United States v. Throckmorton, 98 U.S. 61 , and
Valdez v. City & County of Denver, 878 F.2d 1285 (10th Cir. 1989). See (Doc.
13) at 1-2. Throckmorton holds that “for fraud to lay a foundation for an
independent action, it must be such that it was not in issue in the former
action nor could it have been put in issue by the reasonable diligence of the
opposing party.” Travelers Indem. Co. v. Gore, 761 F.2d 1549, 1552 (11th
Cir. 1985) (per curiam) (citing Throckmorton, 98 U.S. 61).

Summary
Concept of judicial immunity and the conditions under which fraud can be
the basis for an independent action. It references the Throckmorton case,
which establishes that for fraud to be actionable, it must not have been an
issue in the original action or could not have been raised with reasonable
diligence. This suggests that if a third party's fraud was not addressed in the
original proceedings and could not have been reasonably discovered, it
might be possible to attribute harm to the third party's fraud rather than the
court's order.

Concept of judicial immunity, indicating that judges are protected from
liability for their judicial acts, even if those acts are procedurally flawed or
done with malice, as long as they are not performed in the clear absence of
jurisdiction. This suggests that the court's order, even if based on fraudulent
information, would not attribute liability to the judge or the court, but rather
to the third party who committed the fraud.

Concept of judicial immunity, which protects judges from liability for their
judicial actions, even if those actions are alleged to be erroneous, malicious,
or corrupt. This immunity applies regardless of the consequences of the
judicial act. Therefore, the passage suggests that the harm resulting from a
court order, even if based on fraudulent information, is not legally
attributable to the judge due to judicial immunity. Instead, the focus would
likely be on the third party who committed the fraud.

Extract
Fraud upon the court should, we believe, embrace only that species of fraud
which does or attempts to, defile the court itself, or is a fraud perpetrated by
officers of the court so that the judicial machinery cannot perform in the
usual manner its impartial task of adjudging cases that are presented for
adjudication, and relief should be denied in the absence of such conduct.
Fraud inter parties, without more, should not be fraud upon the court, but
redress should be left to a motion under Rule 60(b)(3) or to an independent
action.
Summary
The passage defines "fraud upon the court" as a specific type of fraud that
defiles the court itself or is perpetrated by court officers, affecting the
court's ability to adjudicate impartially. It distinguishes this from "fraud inter
parties," which does not constitute fraud upon the court and should be
addressed through other legal mechanisms like Rule 60(b)(3) or
independent actions. This suggests that if a third party's fraudulent actions
do not meet the criteria for "fraud upon the court," the harm may not be
legally attributed to the court's order but rather to the third party's actions.
United States v. Throckmorton, 98 U.S. 61, 25 L.Ed. 93 (1878)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
We think these decisions establish the doctrine on which we decide the
present case; namely, that the acts for which a court of equity will on
account of fraud set aside or annul a judgment or decree, between the same
parties, rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, have relation to
frauds, extrinsic or collateral, to the matter tried by the first court, and not
to a fraud in the matter on which the decree was rendered.
Summary
The U.S. Supreme Court in Throckmorton established a doctrine
distinguishing between extrinsic and intrinsic fraud. The court will set aside
a judgment due to fraud only if the fraud is extrinsic or collateral to the
matter tried, not if it is intrinsic to the matter on which the decree was
rendered. This means that if a third party's fraudulent actions are
considered extrinsic to the court's decision-making process, the harm could
be attributed to the third party's fraud.

Extract
A covered attorney shall not knowingly: Make a false statement of material
fact or law to a tribunal or fail to correct a false statement of material fact or
law previously made to the tribunal by the covered attorney; ... A covered
attorney who represents a client in an adjudicative proceeding and who
knows that a person intends to engage, is engaging or has engaged in
criminal or fraudulent conduct related to the proceeding shall take
reasonable remedial measures, including, if necessary, disclosure to the
tribunal.
Summary
Attorneys have a duty to avoid making false statements to a tribunal and to
correct any false statements previously made. They also have an obligation
to take remedial measures if they know of fraudulent conduct related to a
proceeding. This suggests that if a third party (such as an attorney)
fraudulently induces a court order, the responsibility for the harm caused by
the fraudulent information could be attributed to the third party's actions,
rather than the court's order, as the court relies on the information
presented to it.
