Question
Answer Short response The unprecedented treatment described in the
provided record—including apparent violations of statutory due process,
disregard for procedural rules, and questionable judicial conduct—warrants
scrutiny and a full investigation by the State Commission on Judicial
Conduct (SCJC), as it raises serious concerns about judicial integrity and
public confidence in the Texas judiciary. The SCJC is empowered and
obligated to investigate such allegations, demand explanations, and, if
necessary, recommend discipline or other corrective action to uphold the
rule of law and the honor of the judiciary. Summary The Texas Constitution
and statutes establish a robust framework for judicial accountability,
empowering the State Commission on Judicial Conduct to investigate and
address allegations of judicial misconduct, including willful violations of law,
incompetence, or conduct that undermines public confidence in the
judiciary. The facts and procedural history outlined in the record—such as
exclusion from residence without a hearing, entry of orders without proper
consent, disregard for local and state procedural rules, and failures in
recusal and emergency relief processes—collectively present a pattern of
conduct that is not only unprecedented but also potentially violative of both
statutory and constitutional standards. Given the gravity and cumulative
nature of these alleged irregularities, the SCJC has both the authority and
the duty to conduct a thorough investigation, demand explanations from the
judges involved, and, if warranted, impose discipline or recommend
removal. Such scrutiny is essential not only for the parties directly affected
but also for the integrity of the Texas legal system as a whole, as these
issues implicate statewide jurisprudence and the public’s trust in the courts.
Background and Relevant Law Legislative and Constitutional Framework
The Texas Constitution, Article V, Section 1-a, and the Texas Government
Code, Chapter 33, establish the State Commission on Judicial Conduct
(SCJC) and empower it to investigate and discipline judges for willful or
persistent violations of law, incompetence, willful violation of the Code of
Judicial Conduct, or conduct that brings discredit upon the judiciary or the
administration of justice (Tex. Const. art. 5 § 1-a; Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.022).
The SCJC is required to conduct a preliminary investigation of any credible
allegation or appearance of misconduct and, if not found unfounded or
frivolous, to proceed to a full investigation (Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.022). The
Texas Family Code and Rules of Civil Procedure set forth specific
requirements for judicial conduct in family law cases, including due process
protections for parties, limitations on the powers of associate judges, and
strict procedures for recusal and emergency relief (Tex. Fam. Code § 83.006;
Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007; Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a). Case Law Texas courts have
repeatedly emphasized that the purpose of judicial conduct proceedings is to
maintain the honor and dignity of the judiciary and to protect the public, not
merely to punish judges (In re Canales, 113 S.W.3d 56 (Tex. 2003); In re
Rose, 144 S.W.3d 661 (Tex. 2004)). The Texas Supreme Court has held that
judges may be sanctioned or removed for willful or persistent violations of
law, incompetence, or conduct that undermines public confidence in the
judiciary (In Re James Barr, 13 S.W.3d 525 (Tex. 1998); Thoma, In re, 873
S.W.2d 477 (Tex. 1994)). The Commission is required to receive and

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
investigate complaints from any source and may act on its own motion. If,
after investigation, the Commission finds sufficient evidence of misconduct,
it may issue sanctions, recommend removal, or take other appropriate action
(In re Rose, 144 S.W.3d 661 (Tex. 2004)). Analysis 1. Statutory and
Constitutional Violations a. Exclusion from Residence Without Due Process
The record describes a situation where a party was excluded from his
residence based on unsubstantiated allegations of family violence, without
an evidentiary hearing or findings of fact. Texas Family Code § 83.006
requires that, before a person can be excluded from their residence by a
temporary ex parte order, the applicant must file a sworn affidavit detailing
the facts and must appear in person to testify at a hearing. The court must
find evidence of recent family violence and a clear and present danger of
future violence (Tex. Fam. Code § 83.006). Failure to adhere to these
requirements is a violation of statutory due process and may constitute
judicial misconduct. b. Entry of Orders Without Proper Consent or Authority
The record also details the entry of agreed orders by an associate judge
where only one party consented, and where a timely request for de novo
review was made. Under Texas Family Code § 201.007, an associate judge
may only render a final order if all parties have agreed in writing or if a
party has filed an unrevoked waiver. If a party withdraws consent or
requests de novo review, the associate judge loses authority to enter a final
order (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007). Orders entered in violation of these
requirements are void and may constitute an abuse of judicial power. c.
Procedural Irregularities and Recusal Failures The record describes failures
to follow mandatory recusal procedures, including improper involvement of
court coordinators and the issuance of referral orders by judges not named
in recusal motions. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a requires that recusal
motions be filed with the clerk, not handled by a judge’s personal staff, and
that only the judge named in the motion may refer the matter to the regional
presiding judge (Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a). Deviation from these procedures
undermines the appearance of impartiality and may violate Canon 2 of the
Texas Code of Judicial Conduct, which requires judges to act at all times in a
manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of
the judiciary. d. Denial of Emergency Relief and Ministerial Duties The
refusal to hear a properly filed emergency motion, especially one concerning
the safety of a child, is a failure to perform a ministerial duty. Texas courts
have held that when a motion is properly filed and pending, the court has a
ministerial duty to consider and rule upon it (In re Layton, 257 S.W.3d 794
(Tex. App. 2008)). Failure to do so, particularly when it results in
preventable harm, is a clear abuse of discretion and may constitute judicial
misconduct. 2. Pattern and Cumulative Effect The cumulative effect of these
irregularities—exclusion from residence without due process, entry of void
orders, disregard for recusal procedures, and failure to perform ministerial
duties—amounts to more than isolated error. It suggests a pattern of
conduct that undermines the integrity of the judicial process and public
confidence in the courts. The Texas Supreme Court has recognized that such
cumulative violations may warrant investigation and discipline by the SCJC
(In re Canales, 113 S.W.3d 56 (Tex. 2003); In re Rose, 144 S.W.3d 661 (Tex.
2004)). 3. SCJC’s Authority and Duty to Investigate The SCJC is specifically
empowered to investigate any credible allegation or appearance of judicial
misconduct (Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.022). If, after a preliminary investigation,
the Commission does not find the allegation unfounded or frivolous, it must

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
conduct a full investigation. The Commission’s mandate is to protect the
public and maintain the honor and dignity of the judiciary, not merely to
discipline judges (In re Canales, 113 S.W.3d 56 (Tex. 2003)). The
Commission may issue public or private sanctions, recommend removal, or
require additional education or mentoring for judges found to have violated
the law or the Code of Judicial Conduct (In re Inquiry Concerning Honorable
Bonnie Rangel CJC No., 677 S.W.3d 918 (Tex. 2023)). 4. Statewide
Jurisprudence and Public Confidence The issues described are not merely of
local concern but have implications for statewide jurisprudence. When
judicial conduct in one case reveals a pattern of disregard for statutory and
constitutional protections, it threatens public confidence in the entire Texas
judiciary. The Texas Supreme Court and the SCJC have both recognized that
the appearance of impropriety or partiality can be as damaging as actual
misconduct (Sears v. Nueces County Sherriff Olivarez, 28 S.W.3d 611 (Tex.
App. 2000)). Exceptions and Caveats It is important to note that not every
judicial error or unfavorable ruling constitutes misconduct. The SCJC is not
an appellate court and does not review the merits of judicial decisions unless
they reflect willful or persistent violations of law, incompetence, or conduct
that undermines the judiciary (In re Rose, 144 S.W.3d 661 (Tex. 2004)).
However, the pattern and severity of the conduct described in the record go
beyond mere legal error and raise legitimate questions about judicial
integrity and accountability. Conclusion The unprecedented treatment
described in the record—including exclusion from residence without due
process, entry of void orders, disregard for recusal and emergency relief
procedures, and a pattern of judicial and staff misconduct—demands
scrutiny and explanation by the State Commission on Judicial Conduct. The
SCJC is empowered and obligated to investigate such allegations, demand
explanations from the judges involved, and, if warranted, impose discipline
or recommend removal. This is essential not only for the parties directly
affected but also for the integrity of the Texas legal system and public
confidence in the judiciary. The circumstances described are precisely the
kind of situation that the SCJC was created to address, and a full
investigation is necessary to uphold the rule of law and the honor of the
Texas judiciary. RESEARCH AND BOLSTER THIS INTO SIX COMPLAINTS:

Answer (Texas)
Short response
Judge James B. Munford’s alleged failure to adhere to fundamental due
process requirements—resulting in the loss of property and custody without
the statutorily required findings—raises serious concerns under Texas
constitutional and statutory law. The State Commission on Judicial Conduct
(SCJC) is both authorized and obligated to commence a full investigation
into these allegations to determine whether judicial misconduct occurred.
Summary
The Texas Constitution and Family Code establish clear procedural
safeguards to protect individuals from deprivation of property and custody
without due process, including requirements for sworn affidavits,
evidentiary hearings, and specific findings before issuing exclusionary or
custody orders. If Judge Munford excluded a party from their residence or
deprived them of custody without following these procedures, such actions
would not only violate statutory and constitutional mandates but could also
constitute willful or persistent judicial misconduct subject to SCJC
investigation.
Given the gravity of the alleged violations—particularly the absence of
required findings and procedural steps—the SCJC has a duty to conduct a
thorough inquiry. This is essential to uphold the rule of law, maintain public
confidence in the judiciary, and ensure that judicial authority is exercised
within the bounds of due process and established legal standards.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Constitutional Framework
The Texas Constitution, Article I, Section 19, guarantees that no citizen shall
be deprived of life, liberty, or property except by due course of law,
embedding due process as a fundamental right for all Texans (Tex. Const.
art. 1 § 19). Article V, Section 1-a, further provides that judges may be

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
removed or disciplined for willful or persistent violations of law,
incompetence, or conduct that discredits the judiciary (Tex. Const. art. 5 § 1-
a).
The Texas Government Code, Chapter 33, empowers the State Commission
on Judicial Conduct to investigate allegations of judicial misconduct. Section
33.022 specifically requires the Commission to conduct a preliminary
investigation into any credible allegation of misconduct and, if not found
unfounded or frivolous, to proceed to a full investigation (Tex. Gov't. Code §
33.022).
The Texas Family Code sets forth detailed procedural requirements for
orders affecting property and custody. Section 83.006 mandates that a party
may only be excluded from their residence by a temporary ex parte order if
the applicant files a sworn affidavit, appears in person to testify, and the
court makes specific findings of recent family violence and clear danger
(Tex. Fam. Code § 83.006). Section 105.001 further requires that orders
excluding a parent from possession or access to a child must be based on
verified pleadings or affidavits and, in certain cases, require notice and a
hearing (Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001).
Case Law
Texas appellate courts have consistently held that due process requires
notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard before a party can be
deprived of property or custody. In In re Berryman, 629 S.W.3d 453 (Tex.
App. 2020), a judge’s issuance of an order without notice or opportunity to
respond was deemed an abuse of discretion and a violation of due process.
Similarly, In re K.L.R., 162 S.W.3d 291 (Tex. 2005) and In re Crystal Aubin,
29 S.W.3d 199 (Tex. App. 2000) emphasize that temporary orders affecting
custody or possession must be supported by verified pleadings or affidavits
and, in many cases, require a hearing and specific findings.
The Texas Supreme Court has clarified that judicial conduct proceedings are
not punitive but are designed to maintain the honor and integrity of the
judiciary (In Re James Barr, 13 S.W.3d 525 (Tex. 1998)). Judicial misconduct
may be found where a judge’s actions are contrary to clear and established
law, especially if the error is egregious, part of a pattern, or made in bad
faith. The SCJC is required to investigate credible allegations and, if
warranted, recommend discipline or removal (In re Rose, 144 S.W.3d 661
(Tex. 2004); In re Canales, 113 S.W.3d 56 (Tex. 2003)).
Analysis
1. Statutory and Constitutional Violations
a. Exclusion from Residence Without Due Process
Texas Family Code § 83.006 strictly limits the circumstances under which a
person may be excluded from their residence by a temporary ex parte order.
The statute requires a sworn affidavit, in-person testimony, and specific

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
findings of recent family violence and clear danger. These procedural
safeguards are designed to ensure that due process is observed before
depriving someone of their home (Tex. Fam. Code § 83.006). The Texas
Constitution reinforces this protection by prohibiting deprivation of property
without due course of law (Tex. Const. art. 1 § 19).
If Judge Munford excluded a party from their residence without these
procedural steps—such as failing to require a sworn affidavit, not holding a
hearing, or not making the required findings—such actions would directly
contravene both statutory and constitutional mandates. The courts have
made clear that orders issued without notice and a meaningful opportunity
to respond violate due process (In re Berryman, 629 S.W.3d 453 (Tex. App.
2020)).
b. Deprivation of Custody Without Required Findings
Section 105.001 of the Family Code provides that temporary orders affecting
custody or access to a child must be based on verified pleadings or affidavits
and, in many cases, require notice and a hearing. The statute prohibits the
exclusion of a parent from possession or access to a child except on a
verified pleading or affidavit, and certain orders require a hearing (Tex.
Fam. Code § 105.001). The Texas Supreme Court has emphasized that such
orders must be supported by evidence of endangerment or impairment to
the child’s welfare (In re K.L.R., 162 S.W.3d 291 (Tex. 2005)).
If Judge Munford issued orders depriving a parent of custody or access
without the required verified pleadings, affidavits, or findings, this would
constitute a failure to adhere to fundamental due process requirements. The
courts have held that such failures are not mere procedural errors but can
rise to the level of constitutional violations (In re Crystal Aubin, 29 S.W.3d
199 (Tex. App. 2000)).
c. Pattern and Cumulative Effect
The cumulative effect of multiple procedural violations—such as exclusion
from residence without due process, deprivation of custody without findings,
and failure to provide notice or hearings—suggests more than isolated error.
The Texas Supreme Court has recognized that a pattern of conduct
inconsistent with judicial duties, especially when it undermines public
confidence in the judiciary, warrants investigation and possible discipline (In
re Canales, 113 S.W.3d 56 (Tex. 2003); In re Rose, 144 S.W.3d 661 (Tex.
2004)).
2. SCJC’s Authority and Duty to Investigate
The State Commission on Judicial Conduct is specifically empowered to
investigate any credible allegation of judicial misconduct. Under Texas
Government Code § 33.022, the Commission must conduct a preliminary
investigation and, if the allegation is not unfounded or frivolous, proceed to
a full investigation (Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.022). The Texas Constitution,
Article V, Section 1-a, provides that judges may be removed or disciplined

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
for willful or persistent violations of law, incompetence, or conduct that
discredits the judiciary (Tex. Const. art. 5 § 1-a).
The Commission’s mandate is to protect the public and maintain the honor
and dignity of the judiciary, not merely to discipline judges (In re Canales,
113 S.W.3d 56 (Tex. 2003)). If the facts alleged against Judge Munford are
substantiated, they would fall squarely within the types of conduct the SCJC
is required to investigate.
3. Application to Judge Munford
The allegations against Judge Munford—specifically, the exclusion of a party
from their residence and deprivation of custody without the required
findings or procedural safeguards—implicate both statutory and
constitutional due process rights. The relevant statutes and case law make
clear that such actions, if proven, would constitute willful or persistent
violations of law and could be deemed inconsistent with the proper
performance of judicial duties.
The Texas Supreme Court has held that judicial misconduct may be found
where a judge’s actions are contrary to clear and established law, especially
if the error is egregious, part of a pattern, or made in bad faith (In Re James
Barr, 13 S.W.3d 525 (Tex. 1998)). The allegations here, if substantiated,
would meet this standard.
4. Public Confidence and Judicial Integrity
Judges are required to conduct themselves in a manner that promotes public
confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary (Sears v. Nueces
County Sherriff Olivarez, 28 S.W.3d 611 (Tex. App. 2000)). The appearance
of impropriety or disregard for due process can be as damaging as actual
misconduct. The SCJC’s intervention is necessary not only to address the
specific allegations but also to preserve the public’s trust in the legal
system.
Exceptions and Caveats
It is important to note that not every judicial error or unfavorable ruling
constitutes misconduct. The SCJC does not function as an appellate court
and does not review the merits of judicial decisions unless they reflect
willful or persistent violations of law, incompetence, or conduct that
undermines the judiciary (In re Rose, 144 S.W.3d 661 (Tex. 2004)). However,
the pattern and severity of the conduct described in the record go beyond
mere legal error and raise legitimate questions about judicial integrity and
accountability.
Conclusion
The allegations that Judge James B. Munford failed to adhere to fundamental
due process requirements—resulting in the loss of property and custody

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
without the required findings—are supported by statutory and constitutional
provisions that mandate procedural safeguards in such cases. The Texas
Constitution, Family Code, and relevant case law all require notice,
hearings, and specific findings before depriving individuals of property or
custody. The SCJC is both authorized and obligated to investigate these
allegations, and a full inquiry is warranted to determine whether judicial
misconduct occurred and to uphold the integrity of the Texas judiciary.
Legal Authorities
Smith v. State Commission on Judicial Conduct, No. 03-04-00376-CV (TX
12/8/2005), No. 03-04-00376-CV. (Tex. Dec 08, 2005)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Smith filed a request for reconsideration, asserting that the Commission's
determination that it could not review 'purely appellate issues' was
erroneous and that his complaints were not purely appellate matters, but
instead alleged breaches of the Code of Judicial Conduct. The Commission
denied Smith's request for reconsideration on grounds that no new evidence
had been presented, stating that the Commission's jurisdiction was limited
to review of allegations of judicial misconduct. After an investigation, the
Commission determined that the municipal judge did not violate the Code of
Judicial Conduct and dismissed Smith's complaint.
Summary
The State Commission on Judicial Conduct has the authority to review
allegations of judicial misconduct, which includes breaches of the Code of
Judicial Conduct. However, it does not have jurisdiction over purely
appellate issues. This is relevant to the question as it highlights the
Commission's role in investigating judicial conduct, which would be
applicable in assessing whether Judge Munford's actions constituted a
violation of due process requirements.

motion, appellee asserted that the State's delay in bringing charges violated
her right to due process as guaranteed under the Fifth Amendment to the
United States Constitution. Appellee additionally argued that the pre-
indictment delay violated her rights to (1) a speedy trial as guaranteed by
the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution,

article I, section 10 of the Texas Constitution, and article 1.05 of the Texas
Code of Criminal Procedure; (2) due course of law under article I, section 19
of the Texas Constitution; (3) a fair trial pursuant to the Sixth Amendment;
and (4) testify and present a defense, as guaranteed by the Fifth and Sixth
Amendments, article 1, sections 10 and 19 of the Texas Constitution, and the
Texas Code of Criminal Procedure. Appellee finally asserted that the
indictment was barred by the doctrine of laches.
Summary
The passage highlights the importance of due process rights under both
federal and state constitutions, emphasizing that delays or procedural
missteps that infringe on these rights can be grounds for legal challenge.
This is relevant to the question of whether Judge Munford's actions violated
due process, as it underscores the necessity of adhering to constitutional
protections in judicial proceedings.

Summary
The passage highlights the ministerial duty of a trial court to consider and
rule on motions that are properly filed and pending. This duty is essential to
ensuring due process, as it requires the court to address the legal matters
brought before it. The passage also notes that a court is allowed a
reasonable time to perform this duty, and whether it has failed to act within
a reasonable time depends on the specific circumstances of the case. This
principle is relevant to assessing whether Judge James B. Munford adhered
to due process requirements, as it underscores the necessity for timely
judicial action on pending motions.

Extract
Judges, individually and collectively, must respect and honor the judicial
office as a public trust and strive to enhance and maintain confidence in our
legal system. Tex. Code Jud. Conduct, preamble, reprinted in Tex. Gov't
Code Ann., title 2, subt. G, app. B (Vernon 1998 & Supp. 2000). In this
regard, the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct requires that judges observe high
standards of conduct so that the integrity and independence of the judiciary
is preserved; conduct themselves at all times in a manner that promotes
public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary; refrain
from conveying or permitting others to convey the impression that they are
in a special position to influence them; and refrain from financial dealings
that tend to reflect adversely on their impartiality or exploit their judicial
position.
Summary
The Texas Code of Judicial Conduct mandates judges to maintain high
standards of conduct to preserve the integrity and independence of the
judiciary. This includes conducting themselves in a manner that promotes
public confidence in the judiciary's integrity and impartiality. The passage
underscores the importance of judges adhering to these standards to
maintain public trust in the legal system.
In re Canales, 113 S.W.3d 56 (Tex. 2003)

Extract
The State Commission on Judicial Conduct, in adopting its findings of fact,
found that Judge Terry A. Canales relentlessly engaged in willful and
persistent conduct clearly inconsistent with the proper performance of his
duties, and further, that his willful and persistent conduct cast public
discredit upon the judiciary or the administration of justice. The Commission
found his action to be in violation of TEX. CONST. art. V, § 1-a(6)A of the
Texas Constitution.
Summary
N example of how the State Commission on Judicial Conduct found a judge's
actions to be in violation of the Texas Constitution due to willful and
persistent conduct inconsistent with judicial duties. This is relevant to the
question as it illustrates the type of conduct that can lead to findings of
judicial misconduct, which could be analogous to the alleged actions of
Judge James B. Munford if he indeed failed to adhere to due process
requirements.

Ex parte Kelley, NO. WR-87,470-01 (Tex. Crim. App. Nov 06, 2019)
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment directs that '[n]o
State shall... deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due
process of law.' In Ex parte Brandley, this Court held that if a State's
'investigative procedure is so improper, it may result in a denial of an
accused's rights to due process of law.' Due Process violations have been
found based on the use of suggestive identification procedures, the
deliberate concealment of a material witness so that he could not be
contacted by the defense or testify at trial, the knowing use of perjury by the
State, or the use of the defendant's coerced confession.
Summary
The passage highlights the fundamental requirement of due process under
the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits the deprivation of life, liberty,
or property without due process of law. It provides examples of due process
violations, such as improper investigative procedures and the use of perjury.
While the passage is primarily focused on criminal proceedings, the
principles of due process are applicable to civil matters, including family law
cases where property and custody are at stake. The failure to adhere to due
process requirements, such as conducting a proper hearing and making
necessary findings, could constitute a violation of these principles.

of the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct.
Summary
The State Commission on Judicial Conduct has the authority to investigate
and make findings regarding judicial misconduct, including willful or
persistent conduct inconsistent with judicial duties. This aligns with the
question of whether Judge James B. Munford failed to adhere to due process

Ex parte Brandley, 781 S.W.2d 886 (Tex. Crim. App. 1989)
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
Applicant alleges that the State's pretrial investigative procedures were 'so
impermissibly suggestive of applicant that it created false testimony
calculated to manufacture circumstantial evidence against applicant in
violation of his right to due process and a fundamentally fair trial.' The trial
court found that the State failed to 'conduct a proper investigation,' and that
the investigation had a 'blind focus' which ignored leads to evidence
inconsistent with the 'premature conclusion that [applicant] had committed
the crime.' The trial court's conclusions of law state that the investigative
procedure was 'so impermissibly suggestive that false testimony was
created, thereby denying [applicant] of due process of law and a
fundamentally fair trial.'
Summary
The passage from Ex parte Brandley highlights a situation where due
process was violated due to improper investigative procedures that led to
false testimony and a fundamentally unfair trial. This is relevant to the
question of whether Judge James B. Munford failed to adhere to due process
requirements, as it provides a precedent for understanding how due process
violations can occur when proper procedures are not followed. The passage
emphasizes the importance of conducting proper investigations and
ensuring that due process rights are upheld to maintain fairness in legal
proceedings.

Their purpose is not necessarily to punish, but to maintain the honor and
dignity of the judiciary of the entire State of Texas and to uphold the
administration of justice for the benefit of all its citizens. ... We are ever
mindful of the fact that legal decisions may be made where the law
thereunder is arguably unclear or ambiguous, and under those
circumstances, judicial disciplinary proceedings are to be discouraged, if not

condemned, as a frontal attack on the independence of the judiciary. It is for
that reason that we hold that a member of the Texas judiciary may be found
to have violated Article V, 1-a(6)A of the Texas Constitution by a legal ruling
or action made contrary to clear and determined law about which there is no
confusion or question as to its interpretation and where the complained-of
legal error is egregious, made as part of a pattern or practice of legal error,
or made in bad faith.
Summary
Standards for judicial conduct proceedings in Texas, emphasizing that such
proceedings are civil in nature and aim to maintain the judiciary's honor and
dignity. It highlights that judicial misconduct can be found when a judge's
actions are contrary to clear and determined law, especially if the legal error
is egregious, part of a pattern, or made in bad faith. This is relevant to
assessing whether Judge Munford's actions constituted a failure to adhere to
due process requirements, as it provides a framework for evaluating judicial
misconduct.
In re Inquiry Concerning Honorable Bonnie Rangel CJC No., 677 S.W.3d 918
(Tex. 2023)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The 'public admonition' arose from a single instance of Judge Rangel filing a
written response to a motion seeking her recusal from a particular case.
Underlying the determination was the rule of procedure stating that a jurist
subject to such a motion 'should not file a response' to it. TEX. R. CIV. PROC.
18a(c)(2). According to the Commission, the mere fact that Judge Rangel
filed a response meant she failed to comport and maintain competence in
the law, thereby violating 'Canons 2A and 3B(2) of the Texas Code of Judicial
Conduct.' ... Article V, Section 1-a(6)(A) of the Texas Constitution states for
what a judge may be disciplined and mandates that a jurist shall not engage
in the willful violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct, or in willful or
persistent conduct that is clearly inconsistent with the proper performance
of her duties or casts public discredit upon the judiciary or on the
administration of justice.
Summary
Importance of judges adhering to procedural rules and the consequences of
failing to do so, as seen in the case of Judge Rangel. It highlights that judges
must comply with the law and maintain professional competence, as
required by the Texas Constitution and the Code of Judicial Conduct. This is
relevant to the question about Judge Munford because it underscores the
standards judges are held to and the potential for disciplinary action if they
fail to meet these standards.

In re Rose, 144 S.W.3d 661 (Tex. 2004)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
If the Commission does not determine that the allegation or appearance of
misconduct is unfounded or frivolous, then the Commission must 'conduct a
full investigation of the circumstances surrounding the allegation or
appearance of misconduct.' Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 33.022(c)(1)(A); see
Tex.R. Rem'l/Ret. Judg. 4(a). Likewise, if the Commission determines that
'sufficient cause exists to warrant full inquiry into the facts and
circumstances indicating that a judge may be guilty of willful or persistent
conduct which is clearly inconsistent with the proper performance of his
duties or casts public discredit upon the judiciary or the administration of
justice,' the Commission must 'conduct a full investigation into the matter.'
Summary
Conditions under which the State Commission on Judicial Conduct is
required to conduct a full investigation into allegations of judicial
misconduct. If the allegations against Judge James B. Munford are not
deemed unfounded or frivolous, and if there is sufficient cause to believe
that his actions were inconsistent with his duties or discredited the judiciary,
the Commission is obligated to investigate further.
Brown, In re, 512 S.W.2d 317 (Tex. 1974)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Section 1--a of Article V of the Texas Constitution provides for the removal
or censure of any judge for 'willful or persistent conduct, which is clearly
inconsistent with the proper performance of his said duties or casts public
discredit upon the judiciary or administration of justice;. . .'
Summary
Constitutional basis for addressing judicial misconduct, emphasizing that
judges can be removed or censured for conduct inconsistent with their
duties or that discredits the judiciary. This is relevant to the question of
whether Judge Munford's actions could be considered a violation of due
process and judicial duties.
In re Crystal Aubin, 29 S.W.3d 199 (Tex. App. 2000)

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The trial court cannot attach the body of a child absent a verified pleading
or affidavit. Tex. Fam. Code. Ann. § 105.001(c) (Vernon Supp. 2000). If right
to possession is governed by a court order, a court in a habeas corpus
proceeding may compel return of a child to the relator only if the court finds
that the relator is entitled to possession under the order. Tex. Fam. Code.
Ann. § 157.372 (Vernon 1996). ... The Texas Supreme Court has
acknowledged that mandamus may issue where the legal process itself
would violate the relator's constitutional rights. Tilton v. Marshall, 925 S.W.
2d 672, 682 (Tex. 1996). Absent a finding, supported by evidence, that the
safety and welfare of the children is significantly impaired by the denial of
the Burks' visitation, Aubin's decision regarding whether the children will
have any contact with the Burks is an exercise of her fundamental right as a
parent. That right is shielded from judicial interference by the Due Process
clause of the United States Constitution.
Summary
The passage highlights the requirement for verified pleadings or affidavits
before a court can attach the body of a child, as per Texas Family Code §
105.001(c). It also emphasizes the necessity of a court finding that a relator
is entitled to possession under a court order before compelling the return of
a child. Furthermore, it underscores the constitutional protection of a
parent's fundamental rights from judicial interference without proper
findings. This is relevant to the question as it provides a legal basis for due
process requirements in custody matters, which Judge Munford may have
violated if he failed to adhere to these standards.
In re Ramirez, 04-24-00361-CV (Tex. App. Aug 14, 2024)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
In her second issue, Ramirez argues the trial court abused its discretion by
issuing a writ of attachment taking possession of the children. On May 10,
2024, the trial court sua sponte issued a writ of attachment removing the
children from Ramirez's possession. In its order, the trial court concluded
there is now and will continue to be a substantial risk of immediate physical
or mental harm to the children if the children remain in Ramirez's
possession. However, the trial court did not recite any facts upon which this
conclusion was based. See Tex. Fam. Code § 152.311(c)(1) (requiring
warrant to take physical custody of child to 'recite the facts upon which a
conclusion of imminent serious physical harm or removal from the
jurisdiction is based'). Moreover, we cannot discern from the record any
facts upon which the conclusion is based. We hold the trial court clearly
abused its discretion by failing to comply with the statutory requirements to

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
issue a warrant to take physical custody of the children. See Walker, 827
S.W.2d at 839-40 (failure to apply law constitutes abuse of discretion); Tex.
Fam. Code § 152.311(c)(1).
Summary
The passage from "In re Ramirez" highlights a situation where a trial court
issued a writ of attachment to remove children from a parent's custody
without providing the necessary factual basis as required by Texas Family
Code § 152.311(c)(1). This failure to recite the facts upon which the
conclusion of imminent harm was based constitutes an abuse of discretion.
The case demonstrates the importance of adhering to statutory
requirements when making decisions that affect custody and due process
rights.

App. Dec 15, 2020)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Here, the Texas Constitution and the Government Code provides the
Commission with authority to administer judicial discipline—including
issuing public admonitions—and they provide an avenue for the Magistrate
Judges to pursue review of to the challenged public admonitions. The Texas
Constitution provides that, '[o]n the filing of a sworn complaint charging a
person holding [judicial] office with willful or persistent violation of rules
promulgated by the Supreme Court of Texas' or other 'incompetence in
performing the duties of the office,' the Commission, 'after giving the person
notice and an opportunity to appear and be heard before the Commission,
may recommend to the Supreme Court the suspension of such person from
office' or take other such action as it may determine is appropriate. TEX.
CONST. art. 5, §1-a(6)(A).
Summary
The Texas Constitution and Government Code provide the State Commission
on Judicial Conduct with the authority to investigate and discipline judges
for willful or persistent violations of rules or incompetence. This includes the
power to recommend suspension or take other appropriate actions. The
passage highlights the procedural framework for addressing judicial
misconduct, which is relevant to the question of whether Judge James B.
Munford's actions warrant investigation.
In re Perricone
Texas Court of Appeals

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
In the petition now before us, Relator contends that the temporary
restraining order (TRO) signed by Judge Moore on June 6, 2024, is void
because it does not adhere to the requirements of Rule 680 of the Texas
Rules of Civil Procedure. Additionally, he re-urges his challenge to the
temporary injunction signed by Judge Moore on June 25 after a hearing
arguing that it is void under Rules 683 and 684 because it: (1) does not set a
date for a trial on the merits; (2) waives the requirement for a bond; (3)
lacks specificity and does not describe the acts to be restrained; and (4)
'cut[s] off [his] access' to the children by requiring, among other things,
counseling as a prerequisite to parent-child contact and further hearings.
Summary
The passage discusses a situation where a temporary restraining order and
a temporary injunction were challenged for not adhering to procedural
requirements under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. The issues raised
include the lack of a trial date, waiver of bond requirements, lack of
specificity, and restrictions on access to children. These procedural
deficiencies are relevant to the question of whether due process
requirements were met, as they highlight potential violations of procedural
rules that could result in due process violations.
In re Berryman, 629 S.W.3d 453 (Tex. App. 2020)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The Berrymans maintain that Respondent abused his discretion by granting
the order in aid of investigation without any basis for the Department's
belief that E.B. suffered abuse or neglect and without probable cause to
enter the home and seize any of their children for interviews... Respondent
violated the Berrymans' due process rights by issuing the order without first
affording them notice and a meaningful opportunity to respond.
Summary
The passage highlights a situation where a judge issued an order without
providing the affected parties notice and a meaningful opportunity to
respond, which is a violation of due process rights. This is directly relevant
to the question of whether Judge James B. Munford failed to adhere to due
process requirements, as it provides a precedent where similar actions were
deemed an abuse of discretion and a violation of due process.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
In the Texas Family Code, Section 109.003 provides... Observing that
termination cases implicate fundamental liberties, Texas courts begin with
the premise that our proceedings to terminate parental rights must comply
with the requirements of procedural due process. The phrase ‘due process,’
although incapable of precise definition, expresses the requirement of
fundamental fairness.
Summary
The passage highlights the importance of procedural due process in cases
involving the termination of parental rights, which is a fundamental liberty
interest. It underscores that due process requires fundamental fairness in
proceedings. This is relevant to the question as it provides a legal
framework for evaluating whether due process was adhered to in cases
involving the loss of custody, such as the one involving Judge James B.
Munford.
In re K.L.R., 162 S.W.3d 291 (Tex. 2005)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Generally, while a suit for modification is pending, the court may not render
a temporary order that has the effect of changing the designation of the
person who has the exclusive right to determine the primary residence of
the child under the final order. TEX. FAM.CODE ANN. § 156.006 (Vernon
2002). However, the court may enter such an order if the child's present
living environment may endanger the child's physical health or significantly
impair the child's emotional development. Id. The court may also make a
temporary order for the safety and welfare of the child, including an order
for the temporary conservatorship of the child. TEX. FAM.CODE ANN. §
105.001(a)(1) (Vernon 2002). If the TRO or temporary order excludes a
parent from possession of or access to a child, it may not be rendered except
on a verified pleading or an affidavit in accordance with the Texas Rules of
Civil Procedure. TEX. FAM.CODE ANN. § 105.001(c)(3) (Vernon 2002).
Certain temporary orders may not be rendered except after notice and a
hearing, including orders (1) for the temporary conservatorship of the child,
(2) for the temporary support of the child, or (3) for payment of reasonable
attorney's fees and expenses. TEX. FAM.CODE ANN. § 105.001(a), (b)

Summary
Requirements for rendering temporary orders in family law cases,
emphasizing that such orders should not change the primary residence of a
child without evidence of endangerment or impairment. It also specifies that
temporary orders excluding a parent must be based on verified pleadings or
affidavits and require notice and a hearing. This directly relates to the
question of whether due process was followed in Judge Munford's actions, as
it provides the legal framework for assessing whether the exclusion from
residence and custody was conducted lawfully.
Tex. Fam. Code § 83.006 Tex. Fam. Code § 83.006 Exclusion of Party From
Residence
Extract
Subject to the limitations of Section FAMILY CODE 85.021, a person may
only be excluded from the occupancy of the person's residence by a
temporary ex parte order under this chapter if the applicant: files a sworn
affidavit that provides a detailed description of the facts and circumstances
requiring the exclusion of the person from the residence; and appears in
person to testify at a temporary ex parte hearing to justify the issuance of
the order without notice. Before the court may render a temporary ex parte
order excluding a person from the person's residence, the court must find
from the required affidavit and testimony that: the applicant requesting the
excluding order either resides on the premises or has resided there within
30 days before the date the application was filed; the person to be excluded
has within the 30 days before the date the application was filed committed
family violence against a member of the household; and there is a clear and
present danger that the person to be excluded is likely to commit family
violence against a member of the household.
Summary
These procedural safeguards are necessary to ensure due process before
excluding someone from their residence.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.022 Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.022 Investigations and
Formal Proceedings
Extract
The commission may conduct a preliminary investigation of the
circumstances surrounding an allegation or appearance of misconduct or
disability of a judge to determine if the allegation or appearance is
unfounded or frivolous. If, after conducting a preliminary investigation
under this section, the commission does not determine that an allegation or
appearance of misconduct or disability is unfounded or frivolous, the

commission shall conduct a full investigation of the circumstances
surrounding the allegation or appearance of misconduct or disability.
Summary
The State Commission on Judicial Conduct (SCJC) has the authority to
conduct a preliminary investigation into allegations of judicial misconduct. If
the allegations are not deemed unfounded or frivolous, the SCJC is required
to conduct a full investigation. This process is applicable to any judge within
Texas, including Judge James B. Munford, if there are credible allegations of
failing to adhere to due process requirements.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.001 Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.001 Definitions
Extract
For purposes of Section 5 1-a, Article V, Texas Constitution, 'wilful or
persistent conduct that is clearly inconsistent with the proper performance
of a judge's duties' includes: wilful, persistent, and unjustifiable failure to
timely execute the business of the court, considering the quantity and
complexity of the business; wilful violation of a provision of the Texas penal
statutes or the Code of Judicial Conduct; persistent or wilful violation of the
rules promulgated by the supreme court; incompetence in the performance
of the duties of the office; failure to cooperate with the commission; or
violation of any provision of a voluntary agreement to resign from judicial
office in lieu of disciplinary action by the commission.
Summary
The Texas Government Code § 33.001 outlines specific types of conduct that
are considered inconsistent with the proper performance of a judge's duties.
This includes willful or persistent violations of the law, incompetence, and
failure to adhere to judicial conduct rules. If Judge James B. Munford's
actions resulted in the loss of property and custody without the required
findings, it could potentially fall under these categories, warranting an
investigation by the State Commission on Judicial Conduct.

Summary
An associate judge in Texas has the authority to render and sign certain
types of orders, including final orders agreed to by all parties, final default
orders, temporary orders, and final orders where a party has filed an
unrevoked waiver. This authority is subject to the right of parties to request
a de novo hearing before the referring court. The passage highlights the
importance of consent and procedural compliance in the issuance of orders,

adhered to in Judge Munford's case.
Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001 Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001 Temporary Orders
Before Final Order
Extract
In a suit, the court may make a temporary order, including the modification
of a prior temporary order, for the safety and welfare of the child, including
an order: for the temporary conservatorship of the child; for the temporary
support of the child; restraining a party from disturbing the peace of the
child or another party; prohibiting a person from removing the child beyond
a geographical area identified by the court; or for payment of reasonable
attorney's fees and expenses. ... Except on a verified pleading or an affidavit
in accordance with the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, an order may not be
rendered: attaching the body of the child; taking the child into the
possession of the court or of a person designated by the court; or excluding
a parent from possession of or access to a child.
Summary
The Texas Family Code § 105.001 outlines the requirements for issuing
temporary orders in suits affecting the parent-child relationship. Specifically,
it mandates that certain actions, such as excluding a parent from possession
of or access to a child, require a verified pleading or an affidavit in
accordance with the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. This ensures that due
process is followed before such significant decisions are made. If Judge
James B. Munford issued orders excluding a parent from possession or
access without adhering to these requirements, it would constitute a failure
to adhere to fundamental due process requirements.

appropriate, direct one or more parties to vacate the residence if the
residence: (A) is jointly owned or leased by the party receiving exclusive
possession and a party being denied possession; (B) is owned or leased by
the party retaining possession; or (C) is owned or leased by the party being
denied possession and that party has an obligation to support the party or a
child of the party granted possession of the residence; provide for the
possession of and access to a child of a party if the person receiving
possession of or access to the child is a parent of the child; require the
payment of support for a party or for a child of a party if the person required
to make the payment has an obligation to support the other party or the
child; or award to a party the use and possession of specified property that

Summary
The Texas Family Code § 85.021 outlines the court's authority to issue
protective orders that can affect property and custody rights. The court may
grant exclusive possession of a residence, provide for child custody, and
restrict the transfer of property. However, these actions must be supported
by appropriate findings and adherence to due process requirements. If
Judge Munford issued orders affecting property and custody without the
required findings or due process, it could constitute a violation of statutory
requirements.

Extract
A Texas court must have personal jurisdiction over a nonresident spouse
before it may determine... Texas state legislature passed into law a
requirement for parenting plans. This requirement seeks to protect children
from the stresses of family law litigation by helping parents resolve their
current and future parenting and by encouraging parents to participate in
and to share the rights and duties of raising their child after the divorce.
[See Editor’s Notes, Tex. Fam. Code §153.601.] A parenting plan is a
temporary or final court order that sets out the rights and duties of parents
in a suit affecting the parent-child relationship. It includes provisions
relating to conservatorship, possession of and access to a child, and child
support, and a dispute resolution process to minimize future disputes. [Tex.
Fam. Code §153.601(4).]
Summary
The passage highlights the requirement for Texas courts to have personal
jurisdiction over a nonresident spouse before making determinations related
to property and custody. It also emphasizes the legislative requirement for
parenting plans to protect children and ensure parental participation in
raising the child post-divorce. This is relevant to due process as it
underscores the necessity of jurisdiction and structured plans in custody
cases.
