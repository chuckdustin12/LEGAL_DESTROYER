Question
The wife has not responded to or defended against the husband's claims in
the divorce proceedings, and the husband has multiple mandamus petitions
pending in the Texas Supreme Court. RICO claims are subject to strict
pleading requirements under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) when
fraud is alleged, requiring the plaintiff to state with particularity the
circumstances constituting fraud. The husband must ensure that his RICO
claim is meticulously detailed, including specific allegations of each
predicate act, the roles of the mother and stepfather in the enterprise, and
how their actions caused his injuries. Failure to meet these pleading
standards could result in dismissal.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Civil RICO claims based on allegations of fraud must be pleaded with
heightened particularity under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b),
requiring the husband to detail the specific circumstances of each
fraudulent predicate act, the roles of the mother and stepfather in the
enterprise, and the causal link to his injuries. Failure to meet these strict
pleading requirements will likely result in dismissal of the husband's RICO
claim.
Summary
To successfully pursue a civil RICO claim involving fraud allegations against
the mother and stepfather, the husband must satisfy the stringent pleading
requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). This requires more
than merely reciting the elements of a RICO claim; the husband must
provide detailed allegations that specify the "who, what, when, where, and
how" of the alleged fraudulent conduct, clearly establish the existence and
structure of the RICO enterprise, demonstrate a pattern of racketeering
activity through at least two predicate acts, and establish a direct causal
connection between these acts and his injuries.
The courts consistently apply heightened scrutiny to civil RICO claims
involving fraud, requiring plaintiffs to plead with particularity the
circumstances constituting fraud for each predicate act. This means the
husband must specify the precise statements or representations alleged to
be fraudulent, identify who made them, state when and where they were
made, explain why they were fraudulent, and articulate how they caused
him injury. Additionally, he must clearly delineate the roles of both the
mother and stepfather in the enterprise and establish how their actions
directly resulted in injury to his business or property. Given that failure to
meet these exacting standards is a common basis for dismissal of RICO
claims, the husband should ensure his complaint contains meticulously

detailed allegations supported by specific facts rather than conclusory
statements.
Background and Relevant Law
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)
The foundation of the pleading requirements for the husband's RICO claim
involving fraud is Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), which states: "In
alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with particularity the
circumstances constituting fraud or mistake. Malice, intent, knowledge, and
other conditions of a person's mind may be alleged generally." Joseph v. Gen.
Conference Corp. of 7th Day Adventist, Civil Action 23-21552-Civ-Scola (S.D.
Fla. Feb 26, 2025). This rule creates a heightened pleading standard for
allegations of fraud, requiring more specificity than the general notice
pleading standard found in Rule 8(a). Lerner v. Colman, 485 F.Supp.3d 319
(D. Mass. 2020).
When fraud is alleged as part of a RICO claim, as is the case in the
husband's situation, courts consistently hold that Rule 9(b)'s heightened
pleading standard applies to those fraud-based elements. As noted in 
Sterling v. Deutsche Bank Nat'l Tr. Co., 19 Civ. 205 (GBD) (JW) (S.D. N.Y.
Mar 27, 2023), "where the predicate acts are alleged to involve fraud, as is
the case here, the plaintiff must also satisfy the heightened pleading
standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), which requires such a
party to 'state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or
mistake.'"
RICO Claims and Required Elements
A civil RICO claim requires the plaintiff to establish: "(1) conduct (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity." King v. G4S
Secure Sols. (U.S.) Inc., CASE NO. 1:18 CV 448 (N.D. Ohio Feb 22, 2019)
(citing Heinrich v. Waiting Angels Adoption Servs., Inc., 668 F.3d 393,
403-04 (6th Cir. 2012)). Additionally, the plaintiff must demonstrate that this
conduct directly resulted in injury to his business or property. Silverstein v.
Percudani, 422 F.Supp.2d 468 (M.D. Pa. 2006).
While the ordinary Rule 8(a) pleading standard may apply to certain non-
fraud elements of a RICO claim, when fraud serves as the basis for the
alleged predicate acts, Rule 9(b)'s heightened pleading requirements apply
to those elements. Menzies v. Seyfarth Shaw LLP, 197 F.Supp.3d 1076 (N.D.
Ill. 2016) ("Following that lead, this Court applies the traditional Rule 8
standard to the non-fraud elements of the RICO claims, and the stricter Rule
9(b) standard to the underlying allegations of fraud-based racketeering
activity within those claims").

Specificity Requirements Under Rule 9(b) for RICO Claims
Courts have consistently interpreted Rule 9(b) to require RICO plaintiffs
alleging fraud to specify:
The precise statements, documents, or misrepresentations alleged to be
fraudulent;
The time and place of and person responsible for the statement;
The content and manner in which the statements misled the plaintiff;
and
What the defendants gained by the alleged fraud.
Joseph v. Gen. Conference Corp. of 7th Day Adventist, Civil Action 23-21552-
Civ-Scola (S.D. Fla. Feb 26, 2025).
Courts commonly describe this as requiring the plaintiff to plead the "who,
what, when, where, and how" of the alleged fraud. Allstate Ins. Co. v.
Benhamou, 190 F.Supp.3d 631 (S.D. Tex. 2016) ("Put simply, plaintiffs must
plead the 'who, what, when, where, and how' of the alleged fraud."). This
means the husband must detail "the particulars of time, place, and contents
of the false representations, as well as the identity of the person making the
misrepresentation and what he obtained thereby." Allstate Ins. Co. v.
Benhamou, 190 F.Supp.3d 631 (S.D. Tex. 2016).
When multiple defendants are involved, as in the husband's case with both
the mother and stepfather, the complaint must "inform each defendant of
the nature of his alleged participation in the fraud." Sterling v. Deutsche
Bank Nat'l Tr. Co., 19 Civ. 205 (GBD) (JW) (S.D. N.Y. Mar 27, 2023). The
husband cannot simply group the defendants together but must specify each
defendant's role in the fraudulent scheme.
Application of Rule 9(b) to Different Components of RICO
Claims
Courts have provided guidance on how Rule 9(b) applies to different aspects
of RICO claims:
Predicate Acts: When the predicate acts involve fraud, such as mail or
wire fraud, the plaintiff must plead the circumstances of that fraud with
particularity. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Misra, 658 F.Supp.3d
362 (W.D. Tex. 2023) ("Consistent with [Fed. R. Civ. P.] 9(b), a RICO
plaintiff alleging predicate acts of fraud... must plead the circumstances
of that fraud with particularity.").
Role of Each Defendant: The complaint must distinguish between
multiple defendants and specify their individual roles in the alleged
fraudulent scheme. Soo J. Ko v. Univ. of the Potomac at Chi., 24 C 1455
(N.D. Ill. Aug 07, 2024) ("In the absence of particular facts to put each
corporate defendant on notice for its alleged involvement in the
predicate acts, plaintiffs' allegations are insufficient to satisfy Rule
9(b)'s requirements.").

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Pattern of Racketeering Activity: The complaint must adequately
allege a pattern of racketeering activity, which requires at least two
predicate acts. Occupational-Urgent Care H. Sys. v. Sutro & Co., 711 F.
Supp. 1016 (E.D. Cal. 1989) ("Plaintiff is required to plead at least two
predicate acts with particularity.").
Enterprise: The complaint must adequately allege the existence of an
enterprise, including the structure and relationships within that
enterprise. Huszar v. Zeleny, 269 F.Supp.2d 98 (E.D. N.Y. 2003)
(dismissing a RICO claim where "the plaintiff in no way elaborates on
how the defendants were engaged in a 'racketeering activity' or how
they participated in an 'enterprise.'").
Causation: The complaint must establish a direct causal connection
between the alleged racketeering activity and the plaintiff's injuries. 
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024-01-01).
Analysis
Requirements for Pleading the Husband's RICO Claim
Given the provided legal framework, the husband's RICO claim against the
mother and stepfather must satisfy several key requirements to survive
scrutiny under Rule 9(b):
1. Detailed Allegations of Each Predicate Act
The husband must allege at least two predicate acts of racketeering activity
with particularity. If these predicate acts involve fraud, as suggested in the
question, the husband must specify for each act:
The exact fraudulent statements or misrepresentations made
Who made these statements (the mother, the stepfather, or both)
When and where these statements were made
Why these statements were fraudulent
How he relied on these statements
What the mother and stepfather gained through this fraud
Federal Ins. Co. v. Webne, 513 F.Supp.2d 921 (N.D. Ohio 2007) makes clear
that Rule 9(b) requires "a plaintiff, at a minimum, to allege the time, place,
and content of the alleged misrepresentation on which he or she relied; the
fraudulent scheme; the fraudulent intent of the defendants; and the injury
resulting from the fraud."
Generalized or conclusory allegations will not suffice. As emphasized in Teri
Woods Publ'g, L.L.C. v. Williams, CIVIL ACTION No. 12-04854 (E.D. Pa. Apr
12, 2013), "The Complaint lacks the 'what, how, where and when' underlying
a proper fraud claim and is devoid of any injection of precision or measure
of substantiation of such claims." The husband's complaint must avoid this
pitfall by providing specific details rather than general allegations.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
2. Clear Articulation of the Enterprise
The husband must clearly define the alleged RICO enterprise involving the
mother and stepfather. This includes detailing:
The structure of the enterprise
The relationships between the mother and stepfather within this
enterprise
How the enterprise functioned
How the enterprise affected interstate commerce
The complaint cannot merely assert the existence of an enterprise without
elaboration, as was the case in Huszar v. Zeleny, 269 F.Supp.2d 98 (E.D. N.Y.
2003), where the court dismissed a RICO claim because "the plaintiff in no
way elaborates on how the defendants were engaged in a 'racketeering
activity' or how they participated in an 'enterprise.'"
3. Specification of Each Defendant's Role
The husband must distinguish between the mother and stepfather and
specify their individual roles in the alleged fraudulent scheme. As noted in 
Sterling v. Deutsche Bank Nat'l Tr. Co., 19 Civ. 205 (GBD) (JW) (S.D. N.Y.
Mar 27, 2023), when multiple defendants are involved, the complaint should
"inform each defendant of the nature of his alleged participation in the
fraud."
The complaint cannot simply group the mother and stepfather together
without specifying their individual actions and responsibilities. For example,
in Loring v. Nelson, No.: 3:19-cv-185 (E.D. Tenn. Dec 19, 2019), the court
noted deficiencies where the complaint "alleges several predicate offenses
as part of the claim under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act ('RICO'), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968, but rarely does it
identify which defendant allegedly committed the predicate act, how it was
committed, and when."
4. Demonstration of a Pattern of Racketeering Activity
The husband must demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity, which
requires showing:
At least two predicate acts within a ten-year period
Relationship between these acts (they have similar purposes, results,
participants, victims, or methods)
Continuity of the criminal activity (either closed-ended continuity,
showing a series of related predicates over a substantial period, or
open-ended continuity, showing a threat of continued criminal activity)
For example, in Loring v. Nelson, No.: 3:19-cv-185 (E.D. Tenn. Dec 19, 2019),
the court criticized allegations of open-ended continuity where "Plaintiffs
cannot simply state communications exist to establish wire fraud; the
complaint must allege the time, place, and content of the misrepresentation
upon which Plaintiffs relied."

5. Direct Causal Connection to Injuries
The husband must establish a direct causal connection between the alleged
racketeering activity and specific injuries to his business or property. As
noted in Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024-01-01), this is an "equally
essential component" of a RICO claim.
The complaint must specify how the mother and stepfather's actions directly
resulted in concrete financial losses or other injuries to the husband's
business or property, not just general harm.
Potential Challenges and Pitfalls
The husband faces several challenges in meeting these stringent pleading
requirements:
1. Risk of Dismissal for Insufficient Particularity
Courts consistently dismiss RICO claims that fail to meet Rule 9(b)'s
heightened pleading standards. In King v. G4S Secure Sols. (U.S.) Inc., CASE
NO. 1:18 CV 448 (N.D. Ohio Feb 22, 2019), the court dismissed a RICO claim
because "[a]t best, Plaintiffs have added paragraphs 81 and 82 to satisfy the
rendition of the elements of a RICO claim under §1962(c). As such, these
allegations do not meet the standards of pleading under Rule 9(b) and Iqbal/
Twombly."
Similarly, in Zucker v. Farish, Civil Action No. 3:18-CV-01790-K (N.D. Tex.
Dec 12, 2018), the court dismissed a civil RICO claim for failing "to allege a
plausible claim for relief," noting that "such pleading is inappropriate,
especially when Rule 9(b) applies to a claim."
2. Difficulty in Distinguishing Between Defendants
The husband must be careful to distinguish between the mother and
stepfather and specify their individual roles in the alleged fraudulent
scheme. In Soo J. Ko v. Univ. of the Potomac at Chi., 24 C 1455 (N.D. Ill. Aug
07, 2024), the court found allegations insufficient where there was an
"absence of particular facts to put each corporate defendant on notice for its
alleged involvement in the predicate acts."
3. Challenges in Pleading Fraudulent Intent
While Rule 9(b) allows intent to be alleged generally, the husband must still
provide sufficient factual basis to support an inference of fraudulent intent.
As noted in Federal Ins. Co. v. Webne, 513 F.Supp.2d 921 (N.D. Ohio 2007),
"allegations of fraudulent misrepresentation[s] must be made with sufficient
particularity and with a sufficient factual basis to support an inference that
they were knowingly made."

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Specific Guidance for the Husband's RICO Claim
Given these requirements and challenges, the husband should consider the
following specific approaches in drafting his RICO claim:
1. Detailed Chronology of Events
The husband should provide a detailed chronology of events, specifying
dates, locations, and the exact nature of each alleged fraudulent act. This
chronology should clearly identify which defendant (the mother or
stepfather) took which action and how these actions constituted predicate
acts under RICO.
2. Specific Examples of Fraudulent Statements or Conduct
The husband should provide specific examples of fraudulent statements or
conduct, including direct quotes when possible, rather than general
characterizations. For example, rather than stating that "the defendants
made fraudulent statements," the husband should specify exactly what
statements were made, by whom, when, where, and why they were
fraudulent.
3. Clear Articulation of the Enterprise Structure
The husband should clearly articulate the structure of the alleged enterprise
involving the mother and stepfather, including their relationships, roles, and
how the enterprise functioned. This should include specific details about
how decisions were made, how resources were allocated, and how the
enterprise's activities affected interstate commerce.
4. Direct Connection to Specific Injuries
The husband should establish a direct connection between each alleged
predicate act and specific injuries to his business or property. This should
include details about the nature of each injury, the amount of financial loss
(if applicable), and how the injury was directly caused by the mother and
stepfather's actions.
5. Distinction Between Defendants
The husband should distinguish between the mother and stepfather
throughout the complaint, specifying their individual roles, actions, and
responsibilities within the alleged fraudulent scheme. This includes detailing
which defendant engaged in which predicate act and how their individual
actions contributed to the pattern of racketeering activity.

Exceptions and Caveats
While the heightened pleading standards of Rule 9(b) apply generally to
RICO claims involving fraud, there are some nuances and exceptions to
consider:
1. Differential Treatment of Fraud and Non-Fraud Elements
Some courts differentiate between the pleading standards applied to fraud-
based elements and non-fraud elements of a RICO claim. As noted in 
Menzies v. Seyfarth Shaw LLP, 197 F.Supp.3d 1076 (N.D. Ill. 2016), "this
Court applies the traditional Rule 8 standard to the non-fraud elements of
the RICO claims, and the stricter Rule 9(b) standard to the underlying
allegations of fraud-based racketeering activity within those claims."
This suggests that while the husband must plead the predicate acts of fraud
with particularity, other elements of the RICO claim (such as the existence of
an enterprise) might be subject to the less stringent Rule 8 standard.
However, given the overall scrutiny applied to RICO claims, the husband
should aim to plead all elements with as much specificity as possible.
2. Relaxed Standards for Information Uniquely Within
Defendants' Knowledge
Some courts may apply a slightly more relaxed standard for information that
is uniquely within the defendants' knowledge. However, this relaxation is
limited, and the husband would still need to provide substantial factual
detail. As noted in Gunderson v. Adm Investor Services, Inc., 85 F.Supp.2d
892 (N.D. Iowa 2000), while Rule 9(b) "clearly imposes obligations additional
to those stated in Fed. R.Civ.P. 8," there might be some flexibility for
information not readily accessible to the plaintiff.
3. Opportunity to Amend After Initial Dismissal
Courts may grant plaintiffs an opportunity to amend their complaints after
an initial dismissal for failure to meet the pleading standards of Rule 9(b). In 
H. Rept. 104-50 Part 1- Common Sense Legal Reforms Act of 1995,
1995-02-24, it is noted that "the court may, in its discretion, permit a single
amended complaint to be filed" after dismissing a complaint for failure to
meet the pleading requirements.
This suggests that if the husband's initial RICO claim is dismissed for
insufficient particularity, he might have an opportunity to amend and
provide more detailed allegations. However, this is discretionary, and courts
may deny leave to amend if they determine that amendment would be futile.
Conclusion
The husband's RICO claim against the mother and stepfather faces
significant hurdles due to the stringent pleading requirements of Rule 9(b).

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
To avoid dismissal, the husband must meticulously detail each element of his
RICO claim, particularly the predicate acts of fraud that form the basis of
the alleged pattern of racketeering activity.
The complaint must specify the "who, what, when, where, and how" of each
fraudulent act, clearly distinguish between the mother and stepfather's
roles, establish the existence and structure of an enterprise, demonstrate a
pattern of racketeering activity, and establish a direct causal connection to
specific injuries to the husband's business or property.
Given the courts' consistent application of heightened scrutiny to RICO
claims and their willingness to dismiss claims that fail to meet these
standards, the husband should approach this complaint with extreme care
and attention to detail. Generic or conclusory allegations will not survive
judicial scrutiny, and the husband must support each element of his RICO
claim with specific factual allegations rather than general characterizations.
By adhering to these requirements and providing the level of detail
demanded by Rule 9(b), the husband may increase his chances of surviving a
motion to dismiss and proceeding to the discovery phase of litigation.
However, the bar is high, and the husband should be prepared for rigorous
judicial examination of his complaint's sufficiency under the heightened
pleading standards applicable to fraud-based RICO claims.
In the context of his ongoing divorce proceedings and pending mandamus
petitions in the Texas Supreme Court, the husband should also consider how
this RICO claim fits into his broader legal strategy and ensure that his
various legal actions are coordinated effectively. If the husband is committed
to pursuing this RICO claim, investing the time and resources to meet these
stringent pleading requirements is essential to avoid early dismissal and the
potential waste of legal resources.

Gunderson v. Adm Investor Services, Inc., 85 F.Supp.2d 892 (N.D. Iowa
2000)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Iowa
Extract
The court therefore granted defendants' motions to dismiss in each case to
the extent that it found the claims of fraud inadequately pleaded under
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 9(b) and 12(b)(6). The Producers were
directed to file an amended complaint adequately pleading fraud pursuant to
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). ... Rule 9(b) clearly imposes obligations
additional to those stated in Fed. R.Civ.P. 8, which establishes notice
pleading. ... Rule 9(b) 'requires that `the circumstances constituting fraud ...
shall be stated with particularity' ... Under the rule, allegations of fraud in a
complaint must (1) specify the statements that the plaintiff contends were
fraudulent, (2) identify the speaker, (3) state where and when the statements
were made, and (4) explain why the statements were fraudulent.

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) requires fraud claims, including those
under RICO, to be pleaded with particularity. This means the plaintiff must
detail the fraudulent statements, identify the speaker, specify when and
where the statements were made, and explain why they are fraudulent. The
court's decision to dismiss claims that do not meet these standards
underscores the importance of meticulous pleading to avoid dismissal.
Menzies v. Seyfarth Shaw LLP, 197 F.Supp.3d 1076 (N.D. Ill. 2016)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Illinois
Extract
Likewise, Rule 9(b) requires a party alleging fraud to 'state with
particularity the circumstances constituting fraud.' Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 9(b).
This 'ordinarily requires describing the ‘who, what, when, where, and how’
of the fraud, although the exact level of particularity that is required will
necessarily differ based on the facts of the case.' ... The Seventh Circuit has
not yet explicitly examined whether Rule 9(b)'s heightened standard extends
to each and every element of a civil RICO claim containing fraud-based
predicate activity within it, or whether Rule 8's less rigorous pleading
standard applies to the non-fraud elements of the violation. ... Following that
lead, this Court applies the traditional Rule 8 standard to the non-fraud
elements of the RICO claims, and the stricter Rule 9(b) standard to the
underlying allegations of fraud-based racketeering activity within those
claims (here, the mail and wire fraud predicates themselves). ... Because
Plaintiff failed to make a proper showing of continuity or its threat, the RICO
counts are dismissed without prejudice. This Court nonetheless gives
Plaintiff leave to file an Amended Complaint re-alleging Counts I and II,
provided he can do so consistent with his obligations under Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 11.
Summary
Rule 9(b) requires a high level of specificity when pleading fraud, which is
applicable to RICO claims involving fraud-based predicate acts. The passage
emphasizes the necessity of detailing the 'who, what, when, where, and how'
of the fraud, which aligns with the proposition that the husband must
meticulously detail his RICO claim. The passage also highlights the potential
for dismissal if these standards are not met, supporting the proposition's
warning about the consequences of failing to meet pleading standards.

Extract
When a complaint alleges claims sounding in fraud, Rule 9(b) requires that
plaintiffs plead the underlying factual circumstances with particularity. Fed.
R. Civ. P. 9(b). Accordingly, Rule 9(b)'s particularity requirement applies to
the pleading of mail fraud as a predicate act in a RICO case. Landry v. Air
Line Pilots Ass'n Intern. AFL – CIO, 901 F.2d 404, 430 (5th Cir.1990) ;
Williams v. WMX Techs., Inc., 112 F.3d 175, 177 (5th Cir.1997) ; Tel – Phonic
Servs., Inc. v. TBS Int'l, Inc., 975 F.2d 1134, 1139 (5th Cir.1992). Rule 9(b)
states that '[i]n alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with
particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake. Malice, intent,
knowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind may be alleged
generally.' Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). Under Rule 9(b), a plaintiff must plead the
particulars of time, place, and contents of the false representations, as well
as the identity of the person making the misrepresentation and what he
obtained thereby. Benchmark Elecs. v. J.M. Huber Corp., 343 F.3d 719, 724
(5th Cir.2003) (quoting Tel – Phonic Servs., 975 F.2d at 1139 ). Put simply,
plaintiffs must plead the 'who, what, when, where, and how' of the alleged
fraud.
Summary
RICO claims involving allegations of fraud must meet the heightened
pleading standards of Rule 9(b). This requires the plaintiff to detail the
circumstances of the fraud with particularity, including specifics about the
time, place, and nature of the fraudulent acts, as well as the identities of
those involved. This is directly relevant to the proposition, as it emphasizes
the necessity for the husband to meticulously detail his RICO claim to avoid
dismissal.
Rosner v. Rosner, 766 F.Supp.2d 422 (E.D. N.Y. 2011)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of New York
Extract
In the Court's view, there is a serious question as to whether the plaintiff has
plead the allegations of fraud that form the primary basis for her RICO claim
with sufficient specificity to satisfy Rule 9(b). See, e.g., Spool v. World Child
Intern. Adoption Agency, 520 F.3d 178, 185 (2d Cir.2008) (noting that RICO
predicate acts based on fraud must be plead with specificity).
Summary
RICO claims involving fraud must meet the strict pleading requirements of
Rule 9(b), which mandates that the circumstances constituting fraud be
stated with particularity. This requirement is crucial for the husband in the
proposition to ensure his RICO claim is meticulously detailed, as failure to
do so could result in dismissal, as demonstrated in the Rosner case.

Federal Ins. Co. v. Webne, 513 F.Supp.2d 921 (N.D. Ohio 2007)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Ohio
Extract
Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure imposes heightened
pleading requirements for all averments of fraud. The Sixth Circuit reads
Rule 9(b) 'liberally, ... requiring a plaintiff, at a minimum, to allege the time,
place, and content of the alleged misrepresentation on which he or she
relied; the fraudulent scheme; the fraudulent intent of the defendants; and
the injury resulting from the fraud.' Coffey v. Foamex L.P., 2 F.3d 157, 161-62
(6th Cir.1993) (internal citation omitted). Thus, 'allegations of fraudulent
misrepresentation[s] must be made with sufficient particularity and with a
sufficient factual basis to support an inference that they were knowingly
made.' Id. at 162 (internal citation omitted).
Summary
The passage from "Federal Ins. Co. v. Webne" highlights the strict pleading
requirements under Rule 9(b) for fraud allegations in RICO claims. It
specifies that plaintiffs must detail the time, place, content, fraudulent
scheme, intent, and resulting injury with particularity. This directly supports
the proposition that the husband must meticulously detail his RICO claim to
avoid dismissal, as failure to meet these standards could result in the claim
being dismissed.
Schuster v. Anderson, 378 F.Supp.2d 1070 (N.D. Iowa 2005)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Iowa
Extract
The defendants first contend that the plaintiffs have not plead the predicate
acts of fraud with the requisite particularity. The defendants assert that the
specificity requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) apply to the
Civil RICO claims, and that the plaintiffs have fallen woefully short of
meeting that requirement. Specifically, the defendants point out the
Complaint alleges 'wire fraud' as the predicate act for the RICO claims, but
does not identify the time, place, contents or speaker of any
misrepresentations made to Schlichte and Schuster. The defendants
additionally assert that the Complaint also fails to set forth specific facts
that made it reasonable for the speaker to know that any statements to
Schlichte or Schuster were materially false or misleading.

Summary
The court emphasizes the necessity of pleading fraud with particularity
under Rule 9(b) when it is a predicate act in a RICO claim. The passage
highlights the requirement to specify the time, place, contents, and speaker
of alleged misrepresentations, which is directly relevant to the proposition
that the husband must meticulously detail his RICO claim to avoid dismissal.

U.S. District Court — Middle District of Pennsylvania
Extract
To successfully allege a RICO claim pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), a
plaintiff must plead: '(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern
(4) of racketeering activity,' as well as a direct injury to his business or
property resulting from the conduct constituting a violation. Sedima S.P.R.L.
v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985). The
fourth prong, 'racketeering activity,' is defined by predicate acts enumerated
in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), which include both wire and mail fraud. Where fraud
is the predicate act, the pleading is subject to heightened requirements of
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). ... Where, as here, plaintiffs rely on
mail and wire fraud as a basis for a RICO violation, the allegations of fraud
must comply with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which requires that
allegations of fraud be pled with specificity.... In order to satisfy Rule 9(b),
plaintiffs must plead with particularity the circumstances' of the alleged
fraud in order to place the defendants on notice of the precise misconduct
with which they are charged, and to safeguard defendants against spurious
charges of immoral and fraudulent behavior.
Summary
For a RICO claim involving fraud, the plaintiff must meet strict pleading
standards under Rule 9(b). This includes detailing the specific
circumstances of the alleged fraud to provide defendants with clear notice of
the claims against them. The passage emphasizes the necessity of
particularity in pleading fraud, which directly supports the proposition that
the husband must meticulously detail his RICO claim to avoid dismissal.

intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind may be alleged
generally.' Claims that sound in fraud, whether rooted in common law or
arising under a statute, implicate the heightened pleading standard of Rule
9(b). ... To plead a civil RICO claim, the plaintiff must allege '1) conduct
[causing injury to business or property] 2) of an enterprise 3) through a
pattern 4) of racketeering activity.' ... Where a fraud claim is asserted as the
predicate act for a civil RICO violation, Rule 9(b)'s particularity requirement
applies.
Summary
Requirements under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) for pleading fraud
with particularity, which is directly relevant to RICO claims when fraud is
alleged as a predicate act. It emphasizes the need for detailed allegations
regarding the circumstances of the fraud, which aligns with the proposition
that the husband must meticulously detail his RICO claim to avoid dismissal.
Idowu v. Astheimer, Case No: C 10-02672 SBA (N.D. Cal. Jan 11, 2011)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of California
Extract
Should Plaintiff decide to amend his complaint to allege a RICO claim based
on mail and wire fraud, he should be aware of its rigorous pleading
requirements. In addition to alleging facts to establish each of the elements
of a RICO claim, Plaintiff must allege any claims of fraud (including wire
fraud and mail fraud) alleged with particularity under Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 9(b). Thus, '[t]o avoid dismissal for inadequacy under Rule 9(b),
[the] complaint would need to state the time, place, and specific content of
the false representations as well as the identities of the parties to the
misrepresentation.'
Summary
RICO claims involving allegations of fraud must meet strict pleading
standards under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). This includes detailing
the time, place, and specific content of false representations and identifying
the parties involved. This supports the proposition that the husband must
meticulously detail his RICO claim to avoid dismissal.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have failed to state a RICO cause of action.
To state a claim for RICO, Plaintiffs must plead: (1) the existence of a RICO
enterprise; (2) the existence of a pattern of racketeering activity, established
by at least two predicate acts identified by 18 U.S.C. § 1961(a); (3) a nexus
between the defendant and either the pattern of racketeering activity or the
RICO enterprise; and (4) resulting injury to the plaintiff's business or
property. Occupational-Urgent Care Health Sys., Inc. v. Sutro & Co., Inc.,
711 F. Supp. 1016, 1021 (E.D. Cal. 1989). Where, as here, fraud is alleged to
be the racketeering activity, the pleading must 'state with particularity the
circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.' ... Plaintiffs fail to meet the
heightened pleading requirements for a fraud-based RICO claim. They have
not included any actual facts pertaining to Defendants (or themselves) or
stating any of the circumstances constituting fraud with any degree of
particularity.
Summary
The passage outlines the essential elements required to state a RICO claim,
particularly when fraud is alleged as the racketeering activity. It emphasizes
the necessity of meeting the heightened pleading standards under Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), which requires stating the circumstances of
fraud with particularity. This directly supports the proposition that the
husband must meticulously detail his RICO claim to avoid dismissal.
Huszar v. Zeleny, 269 F.Supp.2d 98 (E.D. N.Y. 2003)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of New York
Extract
In order to bring a RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege (1) that the defendant
(2) through the commission of two or more acts (3) constituting a
'pattern' (4) of 'racketeering activity' (5) directly or indirectly to conduct or
participate in (6) an 'enterprise' (7) the activities of which affect interstate
or foreign commerce. ... Here, the amended complaint repeatedly asserts a
claim for RICO. However, the plaintiff in no way elaborates on how the
defendants were engaged in a 'racketeering activity' or how they
participated in an 'enterprise.' Indeed, it is not even alleged that their
activities affected interstate or foreign commerce, as this case is merely an
outgrowth of the marital proceedings involving the sale of the marital
property. As such, the Court finds that the RICO claim against the
defendants must be dismissed.
Summary
The court requires specific and detailed allegations to support a RICO claim.
The failure to elaborate on how the defendants engaged in racketeering

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
activity or participated in an enterprise, and the lack of allegations
regarding the effect on interstate or foreign commerce, led to the dismissal
of the RICO claim. This aligns with the proposition that strict pleading
requirements under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) must be met, and
failure to do so could result in dismissal.
De Wit v. Firstar Corp., 879 F.Supp. 947 (N.D. W.Va. 1995)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of West Virginia
Extract
In Jepson, Inc. v. Makita Corp., 34 F.3d 1321 (7th Cir.1994), the Seventh
Circuit Court of Appeals found plaintiffs' amended complaint 'to be wanting
in critical respects' in its allegations of mail and wire fraud. Id. at 1327. The
court concluded that the heightened standard for pleading of fraud found in
Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b) 'of course ... applies to allegations of mail and wire fraud
and by extension to RICO claims that rest on predicate acts of mail and wire
fraud.' ... Rule 9(b) requires that 'in all averments of fraud or mistake, the
circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with
particularity.' Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). These requirements have not been met as to
the allegations of this predicate act.
Summary
RICO claims involving allegations of fraud must meet the heightened
pleading standards of Rule 9(b). This requires the plaintiff to state with
particularity the circumstances constituting fraud, including specific details
about the alleged fraudulent acts. The passage highlights the importance of
meeting these standards to avoid dismissal of the RICO claim, which directly
supports the proposition that the husband must meticulously detail his RICO
claim to avoid dismissal.
Teri Woods Publ'g, L.L.C. v. Williams, CIVIL ACTION No. 12-04854 (E.D. Pa.
Apr 12, 2013)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Pennsylvania
Extract
Here, it is evident from the face of the Complaint that Plaintiffs' RICO claims
sound in fraud. Where a claim is rooted in fraud, the heightened pleading
requirements of Rule 9(b) are activated. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). However,
Plaintiffs have set forth only generalized facts, and failed to plead with the
specificity required under the rule. Rolo, 155 F.3d at 658-59 (complaint must
assert more than generalized facts, it must allege facts specific to the
plaintiff). The Complaint lacks the 'what, how, where and when' underlying a

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
proper fraud claim and is devoid of any injection of precision or measure of
substantiation of such claims.
Summary
When a RICO claim is based on fraud, the plaintiff must meet the heightened
pleading requirements of Rule 9(b). This includes providing specific details
about the fraudulent acts, such as the "what, how, where and when." The
passage illustrates that failure to meet these requirements can lead to
dismissal of the claims, as seen in the dismissal of the RICO claims in the
case due to lack of specificity.

Moreover, where the predicate acts are alleged to involve fraud, as is the
case here, the plaintiff must also satisfy the heightened pleading standard of
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), which requires such a party to 'state
with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.'

Extractive Indus., Inc., 822 F.2d 1242, 1247 (2d Cir. 1987)).
Summary
When fraud is alleged as a predicate act in a RICO claim, the plaintiff must
meet the heightened pleading standard of Rule 9(b). This requires detailing
the circumstances of the fraud with particularity, including the roles of each
defendant. This supports the proposition that the husband must meticulously
detail his RICO claim to avoid dismissal.

under Rule 9(b)). Rule 9(b) requires that '[i]n alleging fraud or mistake, a
party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or
mistake.' Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). To satisfy the Rule 9(b) standard, RICO
complaints must allege: (1) the precise statements, documents, or
misrepresentations made; (2) the time and place of and person responsible
for the statement; (3) the content and manner in which the statements
misled the Plaintiffs; and (4) what the Defendants gained by the alleged
fraud.

Loring v. Nelson, No.: 3:19-cv-185 (E.D. Tenn. Dec 19, 2019)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Tennessee
Extract
Defendants contend Plaintiffs' complaint fails to meet Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 9(b)'s heightened pleading requirements... Specifically,
Defendants assert the complaint alleges several predicate offenses as part of
the claim under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
('RICO'), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968, but rarely does it identify which defendant
allegedly committed the predicate act, how it was committed, and when, and
the complaint does not adequately allege how Plaintiffs were damaged...
Rule 9(b)'s heightened pleading standard applies to RICO claims that involve
allegations of fraud... In alleging open-ended continuity, the complaint
states, 'Defendants' emails and communications amongst themselves and to
Justice's counsel or Justice via email or phone establishes wire fraud within
the meaning of RICO.'... Plaintiffs cannot simply state communications exist
to establish wire fraud; the complaint must allege the time, place, and
content of the misrepresentation upon which Plaintiffs relied.
Summary
RICO claims involving fraud must meet the heightened pleading standards
of Rule 9(b). This requires the plaintiff to detail the circumstances of the
fraud with particularity, including the specifics of each predicate act, the
roles of the defendants, and the impact on the plaintiff. The passage
illustrates the necessity of these details by highlighting deficiencies in the
plaintiffs' complaint in the case at hand, which failed to specify the time,
place, and content of alleged fraudulent communications. This supports the
proposition that the husband must meticulously detail his RICO claim to
avoid dismissal.

U.S. District Court — Northern District of Ohio
Extract
In order to state a RICO claim, the statute requires a plaintiff to allege (with
the specificity required by Rule 9(b)): '(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3)
through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.' Heinrich v. Waiting Angels
Adoption Servs., Inc., 668 F.3d 393, 403-04(6th Cir. 2012), citing Sedima,

(1985). ... At best, Plaintiffs have added paragraphs 81 and 82 to satisfy the
rendition of the elements of a RICO claim under §1962(c). As such, these
allegations do not meet the standards of pleading under Rule 9(b) and Iqbal/
Twombly. Having failed to successfully plead all of the required elements a
RICO claim, Count VI will be dismissed.
Summary
Necessity for a plaintiff to meet specific pleading standards when alleging a
RICO claim, particularly when fraud is involved. It emphasizes the
requirement to detail the conduct, enterprise, pattern, and racketeering
activity with specificity as per Rule 9(b). The failure to meet these
standards, as demonstrated in the case, results in dismissal of the claim.
This directly supports the proposition that the husband must meticulously
detail his RICO claim to avoid dismissal.

U.S. District Court — Western District of Texas
Extract
Consistent with [Fed. R. Civ. P.] 9(b), a RICO plaintiff alleging predicate acts
of fraud... must plead the circumstances of that fraud with particularity.
Defendants contend that Plaintiffs failed to plead the predicate act of mail
fraud with particularity. The RICO statute defines 'racketeering activity,' and
identifies a number of predicate criminal acts including 'section 1341
(relating to mail fraud).' The particularity pleading requirements of Fed. R.
Civ. P. 9(b) apply to RICO claims based on predicate acts of fraud.
Summary
RICO claims involving fraud must meet the heightened pleading standards
of Rule 9(b), which requires plaintiffs to state with particularity the
circumstances constituting fraud. This includes detailing each predicate act
and how it caused the plaintiff's injuries. The passage emphasizes the

U.S. District Court — Northern District of Texas
Extract
Because Plaintiffs fail to allege a plausible claim for relief for their civil
RICO claim, the Court GRANTS the Motion as to the civil RICO claim and
DISMISSES WITHOUT PREJUDICE Count Ten of Plaintiffs' Verified
Complaint... When a plaintiff suffers an injury because of a defendant's RICO
violation, the plaintiff may bring a civil RICO action. 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c)
(2012)... To state a claim based upon any four of the prohibited activities in §
1962, 'a plaintiff must allege: 1) the conduct; 2) of an enterprise; 3) through
a pattern; 4) of racketeering activity.'... Relevant to this Order, any civil
RICO claim must properly plead (1) a pattern (2) of racketeering activity...
As addressed in the Court's previous analysis, such pleading is
inappropriate, especially when Rule 9(b) applies to a claim.
Summary
The passage highlights the necessity for plaintiffs to meet strict pleading
standards when alleging a civil RICO claim, especially when fraud is
involved. The court emphasizes the requirement to detail the conduct,
enterprise, pattern, and racketeering activity, aligning with Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 9(b). The failure to meet these standards led to the dismissal
of the RICO claim in this case, underscoring the importance of meticulous
pleading.

The passage highlights the necessity for a RICO complaint to properly allege
the required predicate acts with particularity, as mandated by Federal Rule
of Civil Procedure 9(b). This aligns with the proposition that the husband

substantive, accessory, aiding abetting and conspiracy liability under RICO.
American Criminal Law Review - Georgetown University Law Center -
Blakey, G. Robert - 1996-01-01
Extract
A principal ground for dismissal was failure to comply with Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 9(b) (pleading fraud with particularity). The Rule embraces
not only fraud in the inducement for liability, but also concealment for tolling
the statute of limitations... Most courts hold that plaintiffs pleading fraud
must identify the time and place of the fraud, the contents, if any, of the
alleged misrepresentations or omissions, and the identity of the party or
parties perpetrating the fraud. A failure to plead fraud with particularity
may warrant dismissal of the complaint.
Summary
RICO claims involving fraud must be pleaded with particularity as required
by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). This includes detailing the time,
place, and nature of the fraudulent acts, as well as identifying the parties
involved. Failure to meet these standards can lead to dismissal of the
complaint. This supports the proposition that the husband must meticulously
detail his RICO claim to avoid dismissal.

Summary
Civil RICO claims are subject to heightened pleading standards under Rule
9(b), which require detailed and specific allegations of fraud. This aligns
with the proposition that the husband must meticulously detail his RICO
claim, including specific allegations of each predicate act and the roles of

The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity.
Summary
Essential elements required to state a RICO claim under § 1962(c),
emphasizing the necessity of pleading each element with particularity,
especially when fraud is involved. This aligns with the proposition that the
husband must meticulously detail his RICO claim, including specific
allegations of each predicate act and the roles of the mother and stepfather,

The pleading requirements for fraud, including RICO claims, are stringent.
The complaint must specify misleading statements or omissions and the
reasons they are misleading. It must also establish scienter with specific
allegations. Failure to meet these requirements can lead to dismissal, which

Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's
Arsenal
Extract
RICO is not a simple statute. It pertains to conduct associated with an
'enterprise' and 'a pattern racketeering activity.' ... First, to bring a civil
RICO claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate that their business or property was
injured as a result of a RICO violation. ... Second, to prove most types of
RICO claims, the plaintiff must plead that the defendant committed some
qualifying criminal action, the most common of which is mail, wire or
securities fraud. ... Third, the plaintiff must plead a pattern of racketeering
activity for most RICO claims. ... And oftentimes, because there is a fraud
component, those instances must be particularly identified in the plaintiff's
pleading—a barrier that can prove difficult to accomplish.
Summary
Strict requirements for pleading a civil RICO claim, particularly when fraud
is alleged. It emphasizes the necessity for the plaintiff to demonstrate a
concrete financial loss, plead specific criminal actions, and detail a pattern
of racketeering activity. These requirements align with the proposition that
the husband must meticulously detail his RICO claim, including specific
allegations and roles of involved parties, to avoid dismissal.

SCOTUS Clarified RICO's Domestic Injury Requirement, Did Not Create
New Civil Right Of Action For Enforcing Arbitration Awards
Extract
Post-Smagin, civil RICO remains a longshot claim with heavy burdens and
discouraging odds. Smagin neither changes the complex substantive
standards applicable to civil RICO claims nor increases a plaintiff's chances
of prevailing on the merits of such claims. Instead, the Supreme Court
merely confirmed that foreign plaintiffs can meet the domestic injury
requirement, which is but one of the many requirements needed to
substantiate a civil RICO claim. Would-be plaintiffs still must overcome
highly-burdensome challenges inherent in civil RICO claims, including
exacting requirements to establish a RICO enterprise, a pattern of
racketeering activity and the elements of specifically-enumerated predicate
acts. When claims are fraud-based (most civil RICO theories are), the
heightened specificity requirements of Rule 9 of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure compound each of these burdens.
Summary
Civil RICO claims are inherently challenging due to the complex substantive
standards and the need for detailed and specific allegations, especially when
fraud is involved. The passage highlights the burdensome nature of these
claims and the necessity for plaintiffs to meet the heightened specificity
requirements of Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. This
directly supports the proposition that the husband must meticulously detail
his RICO claim to avoid dismissal.

Complex AKS/Stark Complaint Survives Rule 9(b) Particularity Challenge ' A
Guide For FCA Complaints
Extract
Generally, a complaint will survive a motion to dismiss if it states a plausible
claim and allows a court to reasonably infer the defendant's liability for the
allegations made therein. Merely reciting the elements of a cause of action
followed by a general statement of liability is insufficient. Further, where a
complaint alleges claims under the FCA, Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure ('Rule 9(b)') applies and requires that the complaining party
'state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.'
Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). As noted by the court, Rule 9(b) imposes a more exacting
pleading standard and requires the complaint to allege facts as to time,
place, and substance of the defendant's alleged fraud, specifically the details
of the defendant's allegedly fraudulent acts, when they occurred, and who
engaged in them.
Summary
Rule 9(b) requires a heightened pleading standard for fraud claims,
necessitating detailed allegations about the fraudulent acts, including
specifics about the time, place, and individuals involved. This aligns with the
proposition that the husband must meticulously detail his RICO claim to
meet these standards and avoid dismissal.
