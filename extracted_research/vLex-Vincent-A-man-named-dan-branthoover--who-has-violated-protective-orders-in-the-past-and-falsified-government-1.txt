Question
A man named dan branthoover, who has violated protective orders in the
past and falsified government records related to school enrollment, assisted
morgan michelle myers in securing an unfair advantage in a divorce
proceeding in texas. to do this, they first deceived the husband, charles
dustin myers, into believing that allowing morgan to visit dan's residence
over the weekend of december 15, 2023, was going to be a good move.
charles relied on this statement, and allowed it. morgan then transferred the
entirety of the joint funds in the marital bank account, amounting to $1,576,
to dan's paypal account, which was later transferred to morgan. she then
traveled to his home across state lines, where s he receieved his assistance
in preparing false court documents to be submitted back in Texas. She
called her grandmother and instigated an eviction attempt at the
matrimonial residence, which was later dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
she then filed for divorce, and the false documents contained false claims of
violence, false claims of active protective orders, and false claims of
indigency, and lead to Charles being removed from the home and divested of
custody of his children, and the issues were awarded to the mother. What
claims does charles dustin myers have against dan, the mother, and in what
venue is proper, federal?
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Charles Dustin Myers may have federal claims against Dan Branthoover and
Morgan Michelle Myers under the wire fraud statute (18 U.S.C. § 1343) and
potentially civil RICO (18 U.S.C. § 1964) based on their interstate scheme
involving deception, misappropriation of funds, and submission of false court
documents. Federal venue would be proper in districts where either
defendant resides or where substantial parts of the events occurred,
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391.
Summary
Based on the facts provided, Charles Dustin Myers likely has several federal
claims against Dan Branthoover and Morgan Michelle Myers arising from
their coordinated interstate actions. Their scheme involved deception to
gain Charles's permission for Morgan's visit to Dan's residence across state
lines, the transfer of joint marital funds to Dan's PayPal account, and Dan's
assistance in preparing false court documents that were submitted in Texas
divorce proceedings. These actions, which involved interstate activity and
wire communications, potentially constitute wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. §
1343, mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1341, and may form the predicate acts
for a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1964.

Regarding venue, federal jurisdiction appears appropriate given the
interstate nature of the scheme and the potential federal claims involved.
Under 28 U.S.C. § 1391, proper venue would be in a judicial district where
either defendant resides, or where a substantial part of the events giving
rise to the claim occurred. This could include the district where Dan's
residence is located (where the false documents were prepared) or the
district in Texas where the divorce proceedings took place and where the
fraudulent documents were filed.
Background and Relevant Law
Federal Wire Fraud Statute
The federal wire fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1343, establishes criminal liability
for individuals who engage in schemes to defraud using interstate wire
communications. The statute provides: "Whoever, having devised or
intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money
or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or
promises, transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or
television communication in interstate or foreign commerce, any writings,
signs, signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme
or artifice, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20
years, or both."
The key elements of wire fraud are: (1) a scheme or artifice to defraud or
obtain money/property through false pretenses, (2) intent to defraud, and (3)
use of interstate wire communications to further the scheme. While 18
U.S.C. § 1343 is primarily a criminal statute, it can also serve as a predicate
act for civil claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO).
Mail Fraud Statute
Similarly, the mail fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1341, criminalizes the use of
mail or interstate carriers in furtherance of fraudulent schemes. The statute
states: "Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or
artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or
fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises... shall be fined under
this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both."
The elements of mail fraud parallel those of wire fraud, requiring: (1) a
scheme to defraud, (2) intent to defraud, and (3) use of mail or interstate
carriers in furtherance of the scheme. Like wire fraud, mail fraud can serve
as a predicate act for civil RICO claims.
Civil RICO
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act provides civil
remedies for individuals harmed by racketeering activities. 18 U.S.C. § 1964
establishes these civil remedies, stating: "Any person injured in his business
or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
therefor in any appropriate United States district court and shall recover
threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, including a
reasonable attorney's fee..."
To establish a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) conduct (2)
of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity (5) causing
injury to business or property. "Racketeering activity" is defined to include
various crimes, including mail fraud and wire fraud.
Importantly, 18 U.S.C. § 1964(a) grants jurisdiction to federal district courts:
"The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction to prevent
and restrain violations of section 1962 of this chapter by issuing appropriate
orders..."
Federal Venue
Federal venue is governed by 28 U.S.C. § 1391, which provides that a civil
action may be brought in:
"(1) a judicial district in which any defendant resides, if all defendants are
residents of the State in which the district is located;
(2) a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions
giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property that is the
subject of the action is situated; or
(3) if there is no district in which an action may otherwise be brought as
provided in this section, any judicial district in which any defendant is
subject to the court's personal jurisdiction with respect to such action."
This statute establishes the framework for determining proper venue in
federal civil actions, including those involving interstate fraud.
Analysis of Charles Dustin Myers' Potential
Claims
Potential Wire Fraud Claims
The facts presented suggest that Dan Branthoover and Morgan Michelle
Myers may have engaged in activities that constitute wire fraud under 18
U.S.C. § 1343. Let's analyze the elements of wire fraud as they apply to this
case:
Scheme to Defraud: The described actions demonstrate a coordinated
scheme between Dan and Morgan. They allegedly deceived Charles into
allowing Morgan to visit Dan's residence across state lines under false
pretenses, transferred joint marital funds without authorization, and
prepared false court documents containing fabricated claims regarding
violence, protective orders, and indigency.
Intent to Defraud: The premeditated sequence of events suggests
intent. The deception regarding the purpose of Morgan's visit, followed
by the immediate transfer of funds and preparation of false documents,
1. 
2. 

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
indicates a deliberate plan to defraud Charles of his property (the joint
funds) and legal rights (related to his home and custody of his
children).
Use of Interstate Wire Communications: The transfer of funds from
the marital bank account to Dan's PayPal account across state lines
almost certainly involved electronic wire communications. PayPal
transactions inherently utilize interstate electronic communications
networks, which would satisfy this element of wire fraud.
The statute specifically targets individuals "having devised or intending to
devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property
by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises"
who use wire communications in interstate commerce to execute such
schemes. 18 U.S.C. § 1343. Dan and Morgan's apparent coordination to
obtain the $1,576 from the joint account through deception and false
representations, using electronic transfers across state lines, aligns with the
statute's prohibited conduct.
While 18 U.S.C. § 1343 is a criminal statute, Charles could potentially use
violations of this statute as predicate acts for a civil RICO claim, which
would allow him to seek monetary damages.
Potential Mail Fraud Claims
Similarly, Dan and Morgan's actions may constitute mail fraud under 18
U.S.C. § 1341 if they used the mail or an interstate carrier in furtherance of
their scheme. This could include:
Mailing the false court documents prepared at Dan's residence back to
Texas for filing in the divorce proceedings;
Using mail or interstate carriers to communicate about their scheme;
or
Sending documents related to the attempted eviction of Charles from
the matrimonial residence.
The statute applies to anyone who "having devised or intending to devise
any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by
means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises" uses
the mail or interstate carriers in furtherance of that scheme. 18 U.S.C. §
1341.
While the facts don't explicitly confirm the use of mail, it's reasonable to
infer that some aspect of their scheme likely involved mail or interstate
carriers, particularly given the interstate nature of their activities and the
need to file court documents in Texas after they were prepared in another
state.

Potential Civil RICO Claims
Based on the potential wire fraud and mail fraud violations, Charles may
have grounds for a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1964. Let's examine
the elements:
Conduct of an Enterprise: Dan and Morgan appear to have operated
as an informal enterprise or association-in-fact, coordinating their
activities toward common objectives. Their coordinated actions—Dan
providing a location for Morgan to stay, assisting with document
preparation, facilitating fund transfers, and Morgan executing parts of
the scheme in Texas—suggest a functioning structure.
Pattern of Racketeering Activity: To establish a "pattern," Charles
would need to demonstrate at least two predicate acts of racketeering
activity within a ten-year period. The potential wire fraud (transfer of
funds via PayPal) and mail fraud (preparation and submission of false
court documents) could serve as these predicate acts. Additionally, the
background information regarding Dan's history of violating protective
orders and falsifying government records could potentially establish a
broader pattern of fraudulent activity, though specific details about
these prior incidents would be needed.
Injury to Business or Property: Charles suffered clear financial
injury through the unauthorized transfer of $1,576 from the joint bank
account. Additionally, he suffered injury to his property interests when
he was removed from his home and lost custody of his children based
on false court documents.
18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) states that "Any person injured in his business or
property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue
therefor in any appropriate United States district court and shall recover
threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, including a
reasonable attorney's fee..." This would allow Charles to pursue treble
damages, making his potential recovery $4,728 for the misappropriated
funds alone, plus damages related to other property interests and attorney's
fees.
The statute further empowers federal courts with jurisdiction to "prevent
and restrain violations" through various remedies, including "ordering any
person to divest himself of any interest, direct or indirect, in any enterprise"
and "imposing reasonable restrictions on the future activities or investments
of any person." 18 U.S.C. § 1964(a). This could potentially allow Charles to
seek injunctive relief against Dan and Morgan's ongoing coordination.
Proper Venue for Federal Claims
Since Charles has potential federal claims under wire fraud, mail fraud, and
civil RICO statutes, federal jurisdiction would be appropriate. The next
question is which federal district court would be the proper venue for these
claims.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
According to 28 U.S.C. § 1391, Charles could file his claims in:
A district where any defendant resides: This would include the
district where Dan Branthoover resides (which appears to be in a
different state from Texas) and/or where Morgan Michelle Myers
resides (presumably Texas). However, this option is available only "if all
defendants are residents of the State in which the district is located."
Since Dan and Morgan appear to reside in different states, this option
may not be available unless Charles chooses to sue only one defendant.
A district where a substantial part of the events occurred: This
presents multiple options:
The district containing the Texas court where the divorce
proceedings were filed and where the false documents were
submitted
The district where Dan's residence is located, where Morgan
traveled, where they prepared the false documents, and where the
funds were transferred to Dan's PayPal account
Given that key elements of the alleged fraud occurred in both locations—the
preparation of false documents at Dan's residence and their filing in Texas
courts—either district could potentially serve as a proper venue for
Charles's claims.
28 U.S.C. § 1391 states that venue is proper in "a judicial district in which a
substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred,
or a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated."
This suggests that Charles has flexibility in choosing between the district
where Dan resides (where the interstate scheme was partially executed) and
the district in Texas where the divorce proceedings occurred and where
Charles suffered the consequences of the fraudulent activities.
The Interstate Nature of the Scheme
The interstate nature of Dan and Morgan's scheme is a critical factor that
supports federal jurisdiction. Their coordination across state lines included:
Morgan's travel from Texas to Dan's residence in another state
Transfer of joint funds via PayPal across state lines
Preparation of false documents in one state for use in Texas courts
Communication across state lines to coordinate these activities
These interstate elements are essential for establishing violations of 18
U.S.C. § 1343 (wire fraud) and potentially 18 U.S.C. § 1341 (mail fraud), as
both statutes require the use of interstate communications or carriers in
furtherance of a fraudulent scheme.

Exceptions and Caveats
Several important caveats should be noted regarding Charles's potential
claims:
Evidence Requirements: To successfully pursue these claims, Charles
would need evidence that Dan and Morgan knowingly made false
representations with the intent to defraud. While the sequence of
events strongly suggests coordination and intent, documentary or
testimonial evidence of their communications and actions would
strengthen his case.
Domestic Relations Exception: Federal courts traditionally decline to
exercise jurisdiction over cases involving domestic relations matters,
including divorce proceedings. However, this exception is narrowly
construed and typically does not bar federal claims that are truly
independent of the divorce proceeding itself. Charles's claims
regarding wire fraud, mail fraud, and RICO violations are based on
allegedly criminal conduct separate from the divorce determination,
potentially allowing federal jurisdiction despite the domestic relations
context.
Statute of Limitations: The statute of limitations for civil RICO claims
is typically four years from the discovery of the injury. Since these
events occurred in December 2023 and the current date is June 2025,
Charles appears to be well within the limitations period.
Proof of Enterprise: For a successful RICO claim, Charles would need
to establish that Dan and Morgan constituted an "enterprise" as defined
by the statute. While their coordinated activities suggest an
association-in-fact, Charles would need to demonstrate some form of
organizational structure and common purpose beyond just the specific
fraudulent acts.
Causation: Charles would need to establish that his injuries were
directly caused by the alleged RICO violations. While the financial loss
from the bank account transfer is clearly tied to their scheme,
establishing that the loss of his home and custody were directly caused
by the false documents (rather than other factors the court may have
considered) could present challenges.
Conclusion
Based on the available legal sources and the facts presented, Charles Dustin
Myers appears to have potentially viable federal claims against Dan
Branthoover and Morgan Michelle Myers. Their alleged actions—involving
interstate travel, wire transfers across state lines, preparation of false
documents in one state for use in another, and coordination of a scheme to
defraud—potentially constitute violations of federal wire fraud and mail
fraud statutes, which could serve as predicate acts for a civil RICO claim.

The wire fraud statute (18 U.S.C. § 1343) specifically targets schemes to
defraud that utilize interstate wire communications, which would apply to
the PayPal transfers involved in this case. Similarly, if any mail or interstate
carriers were used in furtherance of their scheme, the mail fraud statute (18
U.S.C. § 1341) would be applicable.
These potential violations could form the basis for a civil RICO claim under 
18 U.S.C. § 1964, which allows individuals injured by racketeering activities
to seek treble damages and attorney's fees in federal court. The pattern
requirement for RICO could potentially be met by the multiple predicate
acts alleged, including the wire transfer of funds, the preparation and
submission of false documents, and potentially Dan's prior history of
protective order violations and falsification of government records (though
more details on these prior acts would be needed).
Regarding venue, 28 U.S.C. § 1391 provides that Charles could file his
federal claims either in the district where a substantial part of the events
occurred (which could be either the district where Dan's residence is located
or the district in Texas where the divorce proceedings took place) or
potentially in a district where either defendant resides, subject to certain
restrictions.
In summary, Charles Dustin Myers has potentially strong federal claims
against Dan Branthoover and Morgan Michelle Myers based on their
interstate scheme involving deception, misappropriation of funds, and
submission of false court documents. Federal venue would be proper in
districts where either defendant resides or where substantial parts of the
events occurred, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391.
