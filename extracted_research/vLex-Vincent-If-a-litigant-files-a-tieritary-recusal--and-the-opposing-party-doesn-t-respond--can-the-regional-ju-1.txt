Question
If a litigant files a tieritary recusal, and the opposing party doesn't respond,
can the regional judge order the opposing party to file a motion for
sanctions? Explain why David L. Evans doing this is a violation of law, due
process, and shows bias warranting his recusal (if applicable) United States
(Texas) Answer Short response No, under Texas law, a regional judge cannot
order the opposing party to file a motion for sanctions in response to a
tertiary recusal motion; the statutory scheme provides for automatic
attorney’s fees and costs to the prevailing party without requiring such a
motion. If Judge David L. Evans were to order the opposing party to file a
sanctions motion in this context, it would contravene statutory procedure,
violate due process, and could demonstrate bias warranting his recusal.
Summary Texas statutes governing tertiary recusal motions establish a clear,
self-executing process: if a tertiary recusal motion is denied, the judge must
award reasonable attorney’s fees and costs to the party opposing the
motion, and the movant is jointly and severally liable for those amounts.
There is no requirement or authority for the judge to order the opposing
party to file a motion for sanctions, and the statutory language and structure
make clear that the process is intended to be automatic and not adversarial
in this respect. If a regional judge, such as David L. Evans, were to order the
opposing party to file a motion for sanctions when they have not done so,
this would exceed the judge’s statutory authority, disrupt the neutral
administration of the recusal process, and could be perceived as the judge
improperly advocating for one party. Such conduct would violate due
process principles requiring judicial neutrality and could constitute evidence
of bias sufficient to warrant the judge’s own recusal. Background and
Relevant Law Legislative Framework The Texas Civil Practice and Remedies
Code and the Texas Government Code provide the controlling law for
recusal and disqualification of judges, including the specific procedures for
tertiary recusal motions. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 30.016 defines a
tertiary recusal motion as a third or subsequent motion for recusal or
disqualification filed by the same party in a case. Critically, the statute
mandates that if a tertiary recusal motion is denied, the judge must award
reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees and costs to the party opposing the
motion, with the movant and their attorney jointly and severally liable for
those amounts. The statute does not require the opposing party to file a
motion for sanctions; the award of fees and costs is automatic upon denial of
the motion (Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 30.016). Tex. Gov’t. Code §
25.00256 mirrors this procedure for statutory probate court judges, again
requiring the judge to award attorney’s fees and costs to the prevailing
party upon denial of a tertiary recusal motion, with no mention of a
requirement for a sanctions motion (Tex. Gov’t. Code § 25.00256). Tex.
Gov’t. Code § 25.00255 does allow a party to file a motion for sanctions if
they believe a recusal or disqualification motion was filed solely to delay the
case and without sufficient cause. However, the statute only authorizes a
party to file such a motion; it does not empower the judge to order a party to
do so (Tex. Gov’t. Code § 25.00255). Tex. Gov’t. Code § 29.055 (applicable to
municipal judges) further underscores the principle that, once a recusal
motion is filed, the judge must either recuse themselves or refer the matter

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
to the regional presiding judge and may not take further action in the case
until the recusal motion is resolved, except for good cause stated in an order
(Tex. Gov’t. Code § 29.055). Case Law The Texas Supreme Court and Courts
of Appeals have interpreted these statutes to reinforce the automatic nature
of the fee-shifting provision and the limited role of the judge in the recusal
process. In Guilbot v. De Gonzalez, the court held that under section 30.016,
a judge may continue to preside and rule on motions, including assessing
sanctions, even after a tertiary recusal motion is filed. However, the
authority to assess sanctions is tied to the statutory process, not to judicial
orders compelling parties to seek sanctions (Guilbot v. De Gonzalez, 367
S.W.3d 442 (Tex. App. 2012)). In Gonzalez v. Guilbot, the Texas Supreme
Court emphasized that a judge faced with a recusal motion must either
grant the motion or refer it to another judge; any further action taken by the
judge on their own recusal motion is void, underscoring the importance of
strict adherence to procedural rules in recusal matters (Gonzalez v. Guilbot,
315 S.W.3d 533 (Tex. 2010)). Other cases, such as Nelson v. State, reiterate
the fundamental due process requirement that judges remain neutral and
detached, and must not assume the role of advocate or adversary for any
party (Nelson v. State, No. 05-18-00938-CR (Tex. App. May 15, 2019)).
Secondary Materials Secondary sources confirm that the statutory scheme is
designed to be self-executing: if a tertiary recusal motion is denied, the
judge must award attorney’s fees and costs to the prevailing party, and there
is no requirement for the opposing party to file a motion for sanctions. The
judge’s role is to apply the statute, not to prompt or direct parties to seek
additional remedies (Section 30.016. [Effective 9/1/2025] Recusal or
Disqualification of Certain Judges, Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 30.016).
Analysis Statutory Procedure for Tertiary Recusal Motions The Texas
legislature has established a clear, mandatory process for handling tertiary
recusal motions. When such a motion is denied, the judge is required to
award reasonable attorney’s fees and costs to the party opposing the
motion. This process is automatic and does not depend on any action by the
opposing party, such as filing a motion for sanctions (Tex. Civ. Prac. and
Rem. Code § 30.016; Tex. Gov’t. Code § 25.00256). The statutory language is
unequivocal: the judge “shall award” fees and costs. There is no statutory
provision authorizing or requiring the judge to order the opposing party to
file a motion for sanctions. The only context in which a motion for sanctions
is contemplated is in section 25.00255, which allows a party (not the judge)
to file such a motion if they believe the recusal motion was filed solely for
delay and without sufficient cause. Even then, the judge’s role is to rule on
the motion, not to direct a party to file it (Tex. Gov’t. Code § 25.00255).
Judicial Authority and Due Process The judge’s authority in the context of
tertiary recusal motions is thus strictly limited to the procedures set forth in
the statutes. By ordering the opposing party to file a motion for sanctions, a
judge would be acting outside the scope of their statutory authority and
interfering with the adversarial process. This would constitute a violation of
due process, which requires that judges remain neutral arbiters and not act
as advocates for either party (Nelson v. State, No. 05-18-00938-CR (Tex.
App. May 15, 2019)). Due process, as articulated in both Texas and federal
law, demands that judges avoid even the appearance of partiality. When a
judge takes affirmative steps to prompt or direct a party to seek sanctions
against their opponent, especially when the statutory scheme does not
require or authorize such action, the judge risks crossing the line from

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
neutral arbiter to advocate. This is precisely the type of conduct that can
undermine public confidence in the judiciary and violate the due process
rights of the parties (Nelson v. State, No. 05-18-00938-CR (Tex. App. May
15, 2019)). Bias and Grounds for Recusal Judicial bias sufficient to warrant
recusal arises when a judge’s conduct demonstrates favoritism or
antagonism toward a party, or when the judge assumes an adversarial role.
The Texas courts have held that a judge should not act as an advocate or
adversary for any party, and that a clear showing of bias can constitute a
due process violation (Nelson v. State, No. 05-18-00938-CR (Tex. App. May
15, 2019)). If Judge David L. Evans were to order the opposing party to file a
motion for sanctions in response to a tertiary recusal motion, this would be a
clear departure from the statutory process and could reasonably be
perceived as the judge siding with one party against the other. Such conduct
would not only violate the statutory scheme but also the fundamental
requirement of judicial neutrality. This could provide a valid basis for
seeking Judge Evans’s recusal, as it would raise legitimate concerns about
his impartiality and adherence to due process. Case Law Application The
case law supports this analysis. In Guilbot v. De Gonzalez, the court
recognized that a judge may continue to preside and rule on motions,
including sanctions, after a tertiary recusal motion is filed, but this authority
is exercised within the framework of the statute, not by compelling parties
to take adversarial actions (Guilbot v. De Gonzalez, 367 S.W.3d 442 (Tex.
App. 2012)). The judge’s role is to apply the statutory remedy, not to
manufacture or instigate additional adversarial proceedings. Similarly,
Gonzalez v. Guilbot underscores the importance of strict adherence to
procedural rules in recusal matters. Any deviation from the prescribed
process, such as a judge ruling on their own recusal motion or taking
unauthorized actions, renders subsequent orders void and undermines the
integrity of the judicial process (Gonzalez v. Guilbot, 315 S.W.3d 533 (Tex.
2010)). No Authority to Compel Sanctions Motions The only statutory
provision that contemplates a motion for sanctions in the recusal context is
section 25.00255, which allows a party to file such a motion if they believe
the recusal motion was filed solely for delay and without sufficient cause.
However, the statute does not authorize the judge to order a party to file
such a motion; it is entirely within the discretion of the party whether to do
so (Tex. Gov’t. Code § 25.00255). The judge’s role is limited to ruling on the
motion if it is filed, not to instigating or directing its filing. Secondary
materials and commentary confirm this interpretation, emphasizing that the
statutory scheme is designed to be self-executing and that the judge’s role is
to apply the law, not to prompt or direct parties to seek additional remedies
(Section 30.016. [Effective 9/1/2025] Recusal or Disqualification of Certain
Judges, Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 30.016). Implications of Judicial
Overreach If a judge were to order the opposing party to file a motion for
sanctions, this would constitute judicial overreach and a violation of the
statutory scheme. It would also disrupt the adversarial process by placing
the judge in the role of advocate for one party, rather than as a neutral
arbiter. This conduct would violate due process and could provide grounds
for recusal based on bias or the appearance of bias (Nelson v. State, No.
05-18-00938-CR (Tex. App. May 15, 2019)). Exceptions and Caveats There is
no exception in the statutory scheme that would permit a judge to order a
party to file a motion for sanctions in the context of a tertiary recusal
motion. The only context in which a sanctions motion is contemplated is

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
when a party, on their own initiative, believes that a recusal motion was filed
solely for delay and without sufficient cause (Tex. Gov’t. Code § 25.00255).
Even then, the judge’s role is limited to ruling on the motion, not to
directing its filing. Case law does recognize that a judge may continue to
preside and rule on motions, including sanctions, after a tertiary recusal
motion is filed (Guilbot v. De Gonzalez, 367 S.W.3d 442 (Tex. App. 2012)),
but this authority is exercised within the bounds of the statutory scheme and
does not extend to compelling parties to take adversarial actions. Conclusion
Texas law provides a clear, self-executing process for handling tertiary
recusal motions: if the motion is denied, the judge must award attorney’s
fees and costs to the prevailing party, and the movant is liable for those
amounts. There is no statutory or case law authority for a judge to order the
opposing party to file a motion for sanctions in this context. If Judge David L.
Evans were to do so, it would exceed his statutory authority, violate due
process by undermining judicial neutrality, and could constitute evidence of
bias sufficient to warrant his recusal. The integrity of the recusal process
depends on strict adherence to the statutory scheme and the fundamental
requirement that judges remain neutral arbiters, not advocates for either
party. IN THE MATTER OF THE MARRIAGE OF MORGAN MICHELLE

MANDATORY SANCTIONS FOR THE FILING OF TERTIARY RECUSAL
MOTION Before me is a pleading entitled Motion to Recuse Associate Judge
Kaitcer filed by Charles Dustin Myers. This motion was referred to me after
Associate Judge Jeff Kaitcer declined to recuse himself by order dated
September 9, 2025. Mr. Myers has filed three or more motions to recuse
and/or disqualify judges in this case. When a party files his third motion to
recuse in a case, the judge(s) must move the case to final disposition as
though a tertiary recusal motion had not been filed. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.
Code § 30.016 (b) (3); Gonzalez v. Guilbot, 315 S.W.3d 533 (Tex. 2010). That
is, once a tertiary motion to recuse is filed, the judges assigned to the case
are required to proceed and cannot delay the case because of the filing of a
motion to recuse. Further, sanctions are mandatory if a tertiary recusal
motion is denied. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§ 30.016 (c), which provides as
follows: A judge hearing a tertiary recusal motion against another judge who
denies the motion shall award reasonable and necessary attorney's fees and
costs to the party opposing the motion. The party making the motion and the
attorney for the party are jointly and severally liable for the award of fees
and costs. The fees and costs must be paid before the 31st day after the date

United States (Texas) Answer Short response No, under Texas law, a
regional judge cannot order the opposing party to file a motion for sanctions
in response to a tertiary recusal motion; the statutory scheme provides for

automatic attorney’s fees and costs to the prevailing party without requiring
such a motion. If Judge David L. Evans were to order the opposing party to
file a sanctions motion in this context, it would contravene statutory
procedure, violate due process, and could demonstrate bias warranting his
recusal. Summary Texas statutes governing tertiary recusal motions
establish a clear, self-executing process: if a tertiary recusal motion is
denied, the judge must award reasonable attorney’s fees and costs to the

due process principles requiring judicial neutrality and could constitute
evidence of bias sufficient to warrant the judge’s own recusal. Background
and Relevant Law Legislative Framework The Texas Civil Practice and
Remedies Code and the Texas Government Code provide the controlling law
for recusal and disqualification of judges, including the specific procedures
for tertiary recusal motions. Tertiary Recusal Motions: Under Texas Civil
Practice and Remedies Code § 30.016, a tertiary recusal motion is defined as
a third or subsequent motion for recusal or disqualification filed by the same
party in a case. The statute mandates that if such a motion is denied, the
judge must award reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees and costs to the
party opposing the motion, with the movant and their attorney jointly and
severally liable for those amounts. The award is automatic and does not
require the opposing party to file a motion for sanctions. The statute does
not authorize the judge to order the opposing party to file such a motion; the
process is self-executing upon denial of the motion (Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem.
Code § 30.016). Texas Government Code § 25.00256 mirrors this procedure
for statutory probate court judges, again requiring the judge to award
attorney’s fees and costs to the prevailing party upon denial of a tertiary
recusal motion, with no mention of a requirement for a sanctions motion
(Tex. Gov't. Code § 25.00256). Sanctions Motions: Texas Government Code §
25.00255 allows a party to file a motion for sanctions if they believe a
recusal or disqualification motion was filed solely to delay the case and
without sufficient cause. However, the statute only authorizes a party to file
such a motion; it does not empower the judge to order a party to do so (Tex.
Gov't. Code § 25.00255). Due Process in Sanctions Proceedings: Texas Civil
Practice and Remedies Code § 10.003 requires that a party who is the
subject of a motion for sanctions must be given notice of the allegations and
a reasonable opportunity to respond, ensuring due process protections in
any sanctions proceeding (Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 10.003). Case
Law Texas appellate courts have interpreted these statutes to reinforce the
automatic nature of the fee-shifting provision and the limited role of the
judge in the recusal process. In Powell v. Fletcher, 01-22-00640-CV (Tex.
App. Nov 26, 2024), the court confirmed that the award of attorney’s fees
and costs to the party opposing a denied tertiary recusal motion is automatic
and does not require the opposing party to file a motion for sanctions. The
judge’s role is to apply the statute, not to prompt or direct parties to seek

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
additional remedies. In In re Lincoln, 114 S.W.3d 724 (Tex. App. 2003), the
court explained that the statutory scheme for tertiary recusal motions
provides for an automatic award of fees and costs to the prevailing party,
and does not require or authorize the judge to order the opposing party to
file a motion for sanctions. Additional case law, such as Wythe Ii Corp. v.
Stone, 342 S.W.3d 96 (Tex. App. 2011), confirms that while courts have
authority to impose sanctions for frivolous pleadings, there is no authority
for a judge to order a party to file a motion for sanctions. Secondary
Materials Secondary sources confirm that the statutory scheme is designed
to be self-executing: if a tertiary recusal motion is denied, the judge must
award attorney’s fees and costs to the prevailing party, and there is no
requirement for the opposing party to file a motion for sanctions. The
judge’s role is to apply the statute, not to prompt or direct parties to seek
additional remedies (Section 30.016. [Effective 9/1/2025] Recusal or
Disqualification of Certain Judges, Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 30.016).
Analysis Statutory Procedure for Tertiary Recusal Motions The Texas
legislature has established a clear, mandatory process for handling tertiary
recusal motions. When such a motion is denied, the judge is required to
award reasonable attorney’s fees and costs to the party opposing the
motion. This process is automatic and does not depend on any action by the
opposing party, such as filing a motion for sanctions (Tex. Civ. Prac. and
Rem. Code § 30.016; Tex. Gov't. Code § 25.00256). The statutory language is
unequivocal: the judge “shall award” fees and costs. There is no statutory
provision authorizing or requiring the judge to order the opposing party to
file a motion for sanctions. The only context in which a motion for sanctions
is contemplated is in section 25.00255, which allows a party (not the judge)
to file such a motion if they believe the recusal motion was filed solely for
delay and without sufficient cause. Even then, the judge’s role is to rule on
the motion, not to direct a party to file it (Tex. Gov't. Code § 25.00255).
Judicial Authority and Due Process The judge’s authority in the context of
tertiary recusal motions is thus strictly limited to the procedures set forth in
the statutes. By ordering the opposing party to file a motion for sanctions, a
judge would be acting outside the scope of their statutory authority and
interfering with the adversarial process. This would constitute a violation of
due process, which requires that judges remain neutral arbiters and not act
as advocates for either party (Powell v. Fletcher, 01-22-00640-CV (Tex. App.
Nov 26, 2024); Wythe Ii Corp. v. Stone, 342 S.W.3d 96 (Tex. App. 2011)). Due
process, as articulated in both Texas and federal law, demands that judges
avoid even the appearance of partiality. When a judge takes affirmative steps
to prompt or direct a party to seek sanctions against their opponent,
especially when the statutory scheme does not require or authorize such
action, the judge risks crossing the line from neutral arbiter to advocate.
This is precisely the type of conduct that can undermine public confidence in
the judiciary and violate the due process rights of the parties. Bias and
Grounds for Recusal Judicial bias sufficient to warrant recusal arises when a
judge’s conduct demonstrates favoritism or antagonism toward a party, or
when the judge assumes an adversarial role. The Texas courts have held that
a judge should not act as an advocate or adversary for any party, and that a
clear showing of bias can constitute a due process violation (Powell v.
Fletcher, 01-22-00640-CV (Tex. App. Nov 26, 2024)). If Judge David L. Evans
were to order the opposing party to file a motion for sanctions in response to
a tertiary recusal motion, this would be a clear departure from the statutory

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
process and could reasonably be perceived as the judge siding with one
party against the other. Such conduct would not only violate the statutory
scheme but also the fundamental requirement of judicial neutrality. This
could provide a valid basis for seeking Judge Evans’s recusal, as it would
raise legitimate concerns about his impartiality and adherence to due
process. Case Law Application The case law supports this analysis. In Powell
v. Fletcher, 01-22-00640-CV (Tex. App. Nov 26, 2024), the court confirmed
that the award of attorney’s fees and costs to the party opposing a denied
tertiary recusal motion is automatic and does not require the opposing party
to file a motion for sanctions. The judge’s role is to apply the statute, not to
prompt or direct parties to seek additional remedies. Similarly, in In re
Lincoln, 114 S.W.3d 724 (Tex. App. 2003), the court explained that the
statutory scheme for tertiary recusal motions provides for an automatic
award of fees and costs to the prevailing party, and does not require or
authorize the judge to order the opposing party to file a motion for
sanctions. No Authority to Compel Sanctions Motions The only statutory
provision that contemplates a motion for sanctions in the recusal context is
section 25.00255, which allows a party to file such a motion if they believe
the recusal motion was filed solely for delay and without sufficient cause.
However, the statute does not authorize the judge to order a party to file
such a motion; it is entirely within the discretion of the party whether to do
so (Tex. Gov't. Code § 25.00255). The judge’s role is limited to ruling on the
motion if it is filed, not to instigating or directing its filing. Secondary
materials and commentary confirm this interpretation, emphasizing that the
statutory scheme is designed to be self-executing and that the judge’s role is
to apply the law, not to prompt or direct parties to seek additional remedies
(Section 30.016. [Effective 9/1/2025] Recusal or Disqualification of Certain
Judges, Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 30.016). Implications of Judicial
Overreach If a judge were to order the opposing party to file a motion for
sanctions, this would constitute judicial overreach and a violation of the
statutory scheme. It would also disrupt the adversarial process by placing
the judge in the role of advocate for one party, rather than as a neutral
arbiter. This conduct would violate due process and could provide grounds
for recusal based on bias or the appearance of bias. Exceptions and Caveats
There is no exception in the statutory scheme that would permit a judge to
order a party to file a motion for sanctions in the context of a tertiary
recusal motion. The only context in which a sanctions motion is
contemplated is when a party, on their own initiative, believes that a recusal
motion was filed solely for delay and without sufficient cause (Tex. Gov't.
Code § 25.00255). Even then, the judge’s role is limited to ruling on the
motion, not to directing its filing. Case law does recognize that a judge may
continue to preside and rule on motions, including sanctions, after a tertiary
recusal motion is filed, but this authority is exercised within the bounds of
the statutory scheme and does not extend to compelling parties to take
adversarial actions (In re Lincoln, 114 S.W.3d 724 (Tex. App. 2003)).
Conclusion Texas law provides a clear, self-executing process for handling
tertiary recusal motions: if the motion is denied, the judge must award
attorney’s fees and costs to the prevailing party, and the movant is liable for
those amounts. There is no statutory or case law authority for a judge to
order the opposing party to file a motion for sanctions in this context. If
Judge David L. Evans were to do so, it would exceed his statutory authority,
violate due process by undermining judicial neutrality, and could constitute

evidence of bias sufficient to warrant his recusal. The integrity of the recusal
process depends on strict adherence to the statutory scheme and the
fundamental requirement that judges remain neutral arbiters, not advocates
for either party. What Can the Litigant Do? A litigant faced with such judicial
overreach should promptly object on the record to the judge’s order as
exceeding statutory authority and violating due process. The litigant may file
a motion to recuse or disqualify the judge based on demonstrated bias or
lack of impartiality, citing the judge’s departure from the statutory scheme
and the appearance of advocacy for the opposing party. If the judge refuses
to recuse, the litigant may seek mandamus relief from the appropriate
appellate court, arguing that the judge’s actions are void for lack of
authority and violate the litigant’s right to a fair and impartial tribunal
(Powell v. Fletcher, 01-22-00640-CV (Tex. App. Nov 26, 2024); Section
30.016. [Effective 9/1/2025] Recusal or Disqualification of Certain Judges,
Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 30.016). If a litigant files a tieritary recusal,
and the opposing party doesn't respond, can the regional judge order the
opposing party to file a motion for sanctions? Explain why David L. Evans
doing this is a violation of law, due process, and shows bias warranting his
recusal (if applicable) United States (Texas) Answer Short response No,
under Texas law, a regional judge cannot order the opposing party to file a
motion for sanctions in response to a tertiary recusal motion; the statutory
scheme provides for automatic attorney’s fees and costs to the prevailing
party without requiring such a motion. If Judge David L. Evans were to order
the opposing party to file a sanctions motion in this context, it would
contravene statutory procedure, violate due process, and could demonstrate
bias warranting his recusal. Summary Texas statutes governing tertiary
recusal motions establish a clear, self-executing process: if a tertiary recusal
motion is denied, the judge must award reasonable attorney’s fees and costs
to the party opposing the motion, and the movant is jointly and severally
liable for those amounts. There is no requirement or authority for the judge
to order the opposing party to file a motion for sanctions, and the statutory
language and structure make clear that the process is intended to be
automatic and not adversarial in this respect. If a regional judge, such as
David L. Evans, were to order the opposing party to file a motion for
sanctions when they have not done so, this would exceed the judge’s
statutory authority, disrupt the neutral administration of the recusal process,
and could be perceived as the judge improperly advocating for one party.
Such conduct would violate due process principles requiring judicial
neutrality and could constitute evidence of bias sufficient to warrant the
judge’s own recusal. Background and Relevant Law Legislative Framework
The Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code and the Texas Government
Code provide the controlling law for recusal and disqualification of judges,
including the specific procedures for tertiary recusal motions. Tex. Civ. Prac.
& Rem. Code § 30.016 defines a tertiary recusal motion as a third or
subsequent motion for recusal or disqualification filed by the same party in a
case. Critically, the statute mandates that if a tertiary recusal motion is
denied, the judge must award reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees and
costs to the party opposing the motion, with the movant and their attorney
jointly and severally liable for those amounts. The statute does not require
the opposing party to file a motion for sanctions; the award of fees and costs
is automatic upon denial of the motion (Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code §
30.016). Tex. Gov’t. Code § 25.00256 mirrors this procedure for statutory

probate court judges, again requiring the judge to award attorney’s fees and
costs to the prevailing party upon denial of a tertiary recusal motion, with no
mention of a requirement for a sanctions motion (Tex. Gov’t. Code §
25.00256). Tex. Gov’t. Code § 25.00255 does allow a party to file a motion
for sanctions if they believe a recusal or disqualification motion was filed
solely to delay the case and without sufficient cause. However, the statute
only authorizes a party to file such a motion; it does not empower the judge
to order a party to do so (Tex. Gov’t. Code § 25.00255). Tex. Gov’t. Code §
29.055 (applicable to municipal judges) further underscores the principle
that, once a recusal motion is filed, the judge must either recuse themselves
or refer the matter to the regional presiding judge and may not take further
action in the case until the recusal motion is resolved, except for good cause
stated in an order (Tex. Gov’t. Code § 29.055). Case Law The Texas Supreme
Court and Courts of Appeals have interpreted these statutes to reinforce the
automatic nature of the fee-shifting provision and the limited role of the
judge in the recusal process. In Guilbot v. De Gonzalez, the court held that
under section 30.016, a judge may continue to preside and rule on motions,
including assessing sanctions, even after a tertiary recusal motion is filed.
However, the authority to assess sanctions is tied to the statutory process,
not to judicial orders compelling parties to seek sanctions (Guilbot v. De
Gonzalez, 367 S.W.3d 442 (Tex. App. 2012)). In Gonzalez v. Guilbot, the
Texas Supreme Court emphasized that a judge faced with a recusal motion
must either grant the motion or refer it to another judge; any further action
taken by the judge on their own recusal motion is void, underscoring the
importance of strict adherence to procedural rules in recusal matters
(Gonzalez v. Guilbot, 315 S.W.3d 533 (Tex. 2010)). Other cases, such as
Nelson v. State, reiterate the fundamental due process requirement that
judges remain neutral and detached, and must not assume the role of
advocate or adversary for any party (Nelson v. State, No. 05-18-00938-CR
(Tex. App. May 15, 2019)). Secondary Materials Secondary sources confirm
that the statutory scheme is designed to be self-executing: if a tertiary
recusal motion is denied, the judge must award attorney’s fees and costs to
the prevailing party, and there is no requirement for the opposing party to
file a motion for sanctions. The judge’s role is to apply the statute, not to
prompt or direct parties to seek additional remedies (Section 30.016.
[Effective 9/1/2025] Recusal or Disqualification of Certain Judges, Tex. Civ.
Prac. and Rem. Code § 30.016). Analysis Statutory Procedure for Tertiary
Recusal Motions The Texas legislature has established a clear, mandatory
process for handling tertiary recusal motions. When such a motion is denied,
the judge is required to award reasonable attorney’s fees and costs to the
party opposing the motion. This process is automatic and does not depend
on any action by the opposing party, such as filing a motion for sanctions
(Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 30.016; Tex. Gov’t. Code § 25.00256). The
statutory language is unequivocal: the judge “shall award” fees and costs.
There is no statutory provision authorizing or requiring the judge to order
the opposing party to file a motion for sanctions. The only context in which a
motion for sanctions is contemplated is in section 25.00255, which allows a
party (not the judge) to file such a motion if they believe the recusal motion
was filed solely for delay and without sufficient cause. Even then, the judge’s
role is to rule on the motion, not to direct a party to file it (Tex. Gov’t. Code §
25.00255). Judicial Authority and Due Process The judge’s authority in the
context of tertiary recusal motions is thus strictly limited to the procedures

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
set forth in the statutes. By ordering the opposing party to file a motion for
sanctions, a judge would be acting outside the scope of their statutory
authority and interfering with the adversarial process. This would constitute
a violation of due process, which requires that judges remain neutral
arbiters and not act as advocates for either party (Nelson v. State, No.
05-18-00938-CR (Tex. App. May 15, 2019)). Due process, as articulated in
both Texas and federal law, demands that judges avoid even the appearance
of partiality. When a judge takes affirmative steps to prompt or direct a party
to seek sanctions against their opponent, especially when the statutory
scheme does not require or authorize such action, the judge risks crossing
the line from neutral arbiter to advocate. This is precisely the type of
conduct that can undermine public confidence in the judiciary and violate
the due process rights of the parties (Nelson v. State, No. 05-18-00938-CR
(Tex. App. May 15, 2019)). Bias and Grounds for Recusal Judicial bias
sufficient to warrant recusal arises when a judge’s conduct demonstrates
favoritism or antagonism toward a party, or when the judge assumes an
adversarial role. The Texas courts have held that a judge should not act as
an advocate or adversary for any party, and that a clear showing of bias can
constitute a due process violation (Nelson v. State, No. 05-18-00938-CR (Tex.
App. May 15, 2019)). If Judge David L. Evans were to order the opposing
party to file a motion for sanctions in response to a tertiary recusal motion,
this would be a clear departure from the statutory process and could
reasonably be perceived as the judge siding with one party against the
other. Such conduct would not only violate the statutory scheme but also the
fundamental requirement of judicial neutrality. This could provide a valid
basis for seeking Judge Evans’s recusal, as it would raise legitimate
concerns about his impartiality and adherence to due process. Case Law
Application The case law supports this analysis. In Guilbot v. De Gonzalez,
the court recognized that a judge may continue to preside and rule on
motions, including sanctions, after a tertiary recusal motion is filed, but this
authority is exercised within the framework of the statute, not by compelling
parties to take adversarial actions (Guilbot v. De Gonzalez, 367 S.W.3d 442
(Tex. App. 2012)). The judge’s role is to apply the statutory remedy, not to
manufacture or instigate additional adversarial proceedings. Similarly,
Gonzalez v. Guilbot underscores the importance of strict adherence to
procedural rules in recusal matters. Any deviation from the prescribed
process, such as a judge ruling on their own recusal motion or taking
unauthorized actions, renders subsequent orders void and undermines the
integrity of the judicial process (Gonzalez v. Guilbot, 315 S.W.3d 533 (Tex.
2010)). No Authority to Compel Sanctions Motions The only statutory
provision that contemplates a motion for sanctions in the recusal context is
section 25.00255, which allows a party to file such a motion if they believe
the recusal motion was filed solely for delay and without sufficient cause.
However, the statute does not authorize the judge to order a party to file
such a motion; it is entirely within the discretion of the party whether to do
so (Tex. Gov’t. Code § 25.00255). The judge’s role is limited to ruling on the
motion if it is filed, not to instigating or directing its filing. Secondary
materials and commentary confirm this interpretation, emphasizing that the
statutory scheme is designed to be self-executing and that the judge’s role is
to apply the law, not to prompt or direct parties to seek additional remedies
(Section 30.016. [Effective 9/1/2025] Recusal or Disqualification of Certain
Judges, Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 30.016). Implications of Judicial

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Overreach If a judge were to order the opposing party to file a motion for
sanctions, this would constitute judicial overreach and a violation of the
statutory scheme. It would also disrupt the adversarial process by placing
the judge in the role of advocate for one party, rather than as a neutral
arbiter. This conduct would violate due process and could provide grounds
for recusal based on bias or the appearance of bias (Nelson v. State, No.
05-18-00938-CR (Tex. App. May 15, 2019)). Exceptions and Caveats There is
no exception in the statutory scheme that would permit a judge to order a
party to file a motion for sanctions in the context of a tertiary recusal
motion. The only context in which a sanctions motion is contemplated is
when a party, on their own initiative, believes that a recusal motion was filed
solely for delay and without sufficient cause (Tex. Gov’t. Code § 25.00255).
Even then, the judge’s role is limited to ruling on the motion, not to
directing its filing. Case law does recognize that a judge may continue to
preside and rule on motions, including sanctions, after a tertiary recusal
motion is filed (Guilbot v. De Gonzalez, 367 S.W.3d 442 (Tex. App. 2012)),
but this authority is exercised within the bounds of the statutory scheme and
does not extend to compelling parties to take adversarial actions. Conclusion
Texas law provides a clear, self-executing process for handling tertiary
recusal motions: if the motion is denied, the judge must award attorney’s
fees and costs to the prevailing party, and the movant is liable for those
amounts. There is no statutory or case law authority for a judge to order the
opposing party to file a motion for sanctions in this context. If Judge David L.
Evans were to do so, it would exceed his statutory authority, violate due
process by undermining judicial neutrality, and could constitute evidence of
bias sufficient to warrant his recusal. The integrity of the recusal process
depends on strict adherence to the statutory scheme and the fundamental
requirement that judges remain neutral arbiters, not advocates for either
party. IN THE MATTER OF THE MARRIAGE OF MORGAN MICHELLE

MOTION Before me is a pleading entitled Motion to Recuse Associate Judge

Associate Judge Jeff Kaitcer declined to recuse himself by order dated
September 9, 2025. Mr. Myers has filed three or more motions to recuse
and/or disqualify judges in this case. When a party files his third motion to
recuse in a case, the judge(s) must move the case to final disposition as
though a tertiary recusal motion had not been filed. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.
Code § 30.016 (b) (3); Gonzalez v. Guilbot, 315 S.W.3d 533 (Tex. 2010). That

are required to proceed and cannot delay the case because of the filing of a
motion to recuse. Further, sanctions are mandatory if a tertiary recusal
motion is denied. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§ 30.016 (c), which provides as
follows: A judge hearing a tertiary recusal motion against another judge who
denies the motion shall award reasonable and necessary attorney's fees and

Carter____________ Cooper Carter Attorney for Morgan Myers This is a clear
violation of law. What can the litigant do to protect himself from this clear
campaign against him that is violating Texas law in several ways? United
States (Texas) Answer Short response No, under Texas law, a regional judge
cannot order the opposing party to file a motion for sanctions in response to
a tertiary recusal motion; the statutory scheme provides for automatic
attorney’s fees and costs to the prevailing party without requiring such a
motion. If Judge David L. Evans were to order the opposing party to file a
sanctions motion in this context, it would contravene statutory procedure,
violate due process, and could demonstrate bias warranting his recusal.
Summary Texas statutes governing tertiary recusal motions establish a clear,
self-executing process: if a tertiary recusal motion is denied, the judge must
award reasonable attorney’s fees and costs to the party opposing the
motion, and the movant is jointly and severally liable for those amounts.
There is no requirement or authority for the judge to order the opposing
party to file a motion for sanctions, and the statutory language and structure
make clear that the process is intended to be automatic and not adversarial
in this respect. If a regional judge, such as David L. Evans, were to order the
opposing party to file a motion for sanctions when they have not done so,
this would exceed the judge’s statutory authority, disrupt the neutral
administration of the recusal process, and could be perceived as the judge
improperly advocating for one party. Such conduct would violate due
process principles requiring judicial neutrality and could constitute evidence
of bias sufficient to warrant the judge’s own recusal. Background and
Relevant Law Legislative Framework The Texas Civil Practice and Remedies
Code and the Texas Government Code provide the controlling law for
recusal and disqualification of judges, including the specific procedures for
tertiary recusal motions. Tertiary Recusal Motions: Under Texas Civil
Practice and Remedies Code § 30.016, a tertiary recusal motion is defined as
a third or subsequent motion for recusal or disqualification filed by the same
party in a case. The statute mandates that if such a motion is denied, the
judge must award reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees and costs to the
party opposing the motion, with the movant and their attorney jointly and
severally liable for those amounts. The award is automatic and does not
require the opposing party to file a motion for sanctions. The statute does
not authorize the judge to order the opposing party to file such a motion; the
process is self-executing upon denial of the motion (Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem.
Code § 30.016). Texas Government Code § 25.00256 mirrors this procedure
for statutory probate court judges, again requiring the judge to award
attorney’s fees and costs to the prevailing party upon denial of a tertiary
recusal motion, with no mention of a requirement for a sanctions motion
(Tex. Gov't. Code § 25.00256). Sanctions Motions: Texas Government Code §
25.00255 allows a party to file a motion for sanctions if they believe a
recusal or disqualification motion was filed solely to delay the case and
without sufficient cause. However, the statute only authorizes a party to file
such a motion; it does not empower the judge to order a party to do so (Tex.
Gov't. Code § 25.00255). Due Process in Sanctions Proceedings: Texas Civil
Practice and Remedies Code § 10.003 requires that a party who is the

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
subject of a motion for sanctions must be given notice of the allegations and
a reasonable opportunity to respond, ensuring due process protections in
any sanctions proceeding (Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 10.003). Case
Law Texas appellate courts have interpreted these statutes to reinforce the
automatic nature of the fee-shifting provision and the limited role of the
judge in the recusal process. In Powell v. Fletcher, 01-22-00640-CV (Tex.
App. Nov 26, 2024), the court confirmed that the award of attorney’s fees
and costs to the party opposing a denied tertiary recusal motion is automatic
and does not require the opposing party to file a motion for sanctions. The
judge’s role is to apply the statute, not to prompt or direct parties to seek
additional remedies. In In re Lincoln, 114 S.W.3d 724 (Tex. App. 2003), the
court explained that the statutory scheme for tertiary recusal motions
provides for an automatic award of fees and costs to the prevailing party,
and does not require or authorize the judge to order the opposing party to
file a motion for sanctions. Additional case law, such as Wythe Ii Corp. v.
Stone, 342 S.W.3d 96 (Tex. App. 2011), confirms that while courts have
authority to impose sanctions for frivolous pleadings, there is no authority
for a judge to order a party to file a motion for sanctions. Secondary
Materials Secondary sources confirm that the statutory scheme is designed
to be self-executing: if a tertiary recusal motion is denied, the judge must
award attorney’s fees and costs to the prevailing party, and there is no
requirement for the opposing party to file a motion for sanctions. The
judge’s role is to apply the statute, not to prompt or direct parties to seek
additional remedies (Section 30.016. [Effective 9/1/2025] Recusal or
Disqualification of Certain Judges, Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 30.016).
Analysis Statutory Procedure for Tertiary Recusal Motions The Texas
legislature has established a clear, mandatory process for handling tertiary
recusal motions. When such a motion is denied, the judge is required to
award reasonable attorney’s fees and costs to the party opposing the
motion. This process is automatic and does not depend on any action by the
opposing party, such as filing a motion for sanctions (Tex. Civ. Prac. and
Rem. Code § 30.016; Tex. Gov't. Code § 25.00256). The statutory language is
unequivocal: the judge “shall award” fees and costs. There is no statutory
provision authorizing or requiring the judge to order the opposing party to
file a motion for sanctions. The only context in which a motion for sanctions
is contemplated is in section 25.00255, which allows a party (not the judge)
to file such a motion if they believe the recusal motion was filed solely for
delay and without sufficient cause. Even then, the judge’s role is to rule on
the motion, not to direct a party to file it (Tex. Gov't. Code § 25.00255).
Judicial Authority and Due Process The judge’s authority in the context of
tertiary recusal motions is thus strictly limited to the procedures set forth in
the statutes. By ordering the opposing party to file a motion for sanctions, a
judge would be acting outside the scope of their statutory authority and
interfering with the adversarial process. This would constitute a violation of
due process, which requires that judges remain neutral arbiters and not act
as advocates for either party (Powell v. Fletcher, 01-22-00640-CV (Tex. App.
Nov 26, 2024); Wythe Ii Corp. v. Stone, 342 S.W.3d 96 (Tex. App. 2011)). Due
process, as articulated in both Texas and federal law, demands that judges
avoid even the appearance of partiality. When a judge takes affirmative steps
to prompt or direct a party to seek sanctions against their opponent,
especially when the statutory scheme does not require or authorize such
action, the judge risks crossing the line from neutral arbiter to advocate.

This is precisely the type of conduct that can undermine public confidence in
the judiciary and violate the due process rights of the parties. Bias and
Grounds for Recusal Judicial bias sufficient to warrant recusal arises when a
judge’s conduct demonstrates favoritism or antagonism toward a party, or
when the judge assumes an adversarial role. The Texas courts have held that
a judge should not act as an advocate or adversary for any party, and that a
clear showing of bias can constitute a due process violation (Powell v.
Fletcher, 01-22-00640-CV (Tex. App. Nov 26, 2024)). If Judge David L. Evans
were to order the opposing party to file a motion for sanctions in response to
a tertiary recusal motion, this would be a clear departure from the statutory
process and could reasonably be perceived as the judge siding with one
party against the other. Such conduct would not only violate the statutory
scheme but also the fundamental requirement of judicial neutrality. This
could provide a valid basis for seeking Judge Evans’s recusal, as it would
raise legitimate concerns about his impartiality and adherence to due
process. Case Law Application The case law supports this analysis. In Powell
v. Fletcher, 01-22-00640-CV (Tex. App. Nov 26, 2024), the court confirmed
that the award of attorney’s fees and costs to the party opposing a denied
tertiary recusal motion is automatic and does not require the opposing party
to file a motion for sanctions. The judge’s role is to apply the statute, not to
prompt or direct parties to seek additional remedies. Similarly, in In re
Lincoln, 114 S.W.3d 724 (Tex. App. 2003), the court explained that the
statutory scheme for tertiary recusal motions provides for an automatic
award of fees and costs to the prevailing party, and does not require or
authorize the judge to order the opposing party to file a motion for
sanctions. No Authority to Compel Sanctions Motions The only statutory
provision that contemplates a motion for sanctions in the recusal context is
section 25.00255, which allows a party to file such a motion if they believe
the recusal motion was filed solely for delay and without sufficient cause.
However, the statute does not authorize the judge to order a party to file
such a motion; it is entirely within the discretion of the party whether to do
so (Tex. Gov't. Code § 25.00255). The judge’s role is limited to ruling on the
motion if it is filed, not to instigating or directing its filing. Secondary
materials and commentary confirm this interpretation, emphasizing that the
statutory scheme is designed to be self-executing and that the judge’s role is
to apply the law, not to prompt or direct parties to seek additional remedies
(Section 30.016. [Effective 9/1/2025] Recusal or Disqualification of Certain
Judges, Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 30.016). Implications of Judicial
Overreach If a judge were to order the opposing party to file a motion for
sanctions, this would constitute judicial overreach and a violation of the
statutory scheme. It would also disrupt the adversarial process by placing
the judge in the role of advocate for one party, rather than as a neutral
arbiter. This conduct would violate due process and could provide grounds
for recusal based on bias or the appearance of bias. Exceptions and Caveats
There is no exception in the statutory scheme that would permit a judge to
order a party to file a motion for sanctions in the context of a tertiary
recusal motion. The only context in which a sanctions motion is
contemplated is when a party, on their own initiative, believes that a recusal
motion was filed solely for delay and without sufficient cause (Tex. Gov't.
Code § 25.00255). Even then, the judge’s role is limited to ruling on the
motion, not to directing its filing. Case law does recognize that a judge may
continue to preside and rule on motions, including sanctions, after a tertiary

recusal motion is filed, but this authority is exercised within the bounds of
the statutory scheme and does not extend to compelling parties to take
adversarial actions (In re Lincoln, 114 S.W.3d 724 (Tex. App. 2003)).
Conclusion Texas law provides a clear, self-executing process for handling
tertiary recusal motions: if the motion is denied, the judge must award
attorney’s fees and costs to the prevailing party, and the movant is liable for
those amounts. There is no statutory or case law authority for a judge to
order the opposing party to file a motion for sanctions in this context. If
Judge David L. Evans were to do so, it would exceed his statutory authority,
violate due process by undermining judicial neutrality, and could constitute
evidence of bias sufficient to warrant his recusal. The integrity of the recusal
process depends on strict adherence to the statutory scheme and the
fundamental requirement that judges remain neutral arbiters, not advocates
for either party. What Can the Litigant Do? A litigant faced with such judicial
overreach should promptly object on the record to the judge’s order as
exceeding statutory authority and violating due process. The litigant may file
a motion to recuse or disqualify the judge based on demonstrated bias or
lack of impartiality, citing the judge’s departure from the statutory scheme
and the appearance of advocacy for the opposing party. If the judge refuses
to recuse, the litigant may seek mandamus relief from the appropriate
appellate court, arguing that the judge’s actions are void for lack of
authority and violate the litigant’s right to a fair and impartial tribunal
(Powell v. Fletcher, 01-22-00640-CV (Tex. App. Nov 26, 2024); Section
30.016. [Effective 9/1/2025] Recusal or Disqualification of Certain Judges,
Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 30.016). To make matters worse, the litigant
already did file a motion to recuse before the order denying the recusal of
the district judge. He filed mandamus in supreme court to compel him to
forward it to the chief justice, which he shortly did thereafter. Maybe
another direct mandamus appeal? Or should he just object? Pretend to be
charles, and petition the supreme court and/or object on the record to this
order. The judge’s order can be reasonably perceived as advocating for one
party over the other. Judicial bias sufficient to warrant recusal arises when a
judge’s conduct demonstrates favoritism or antagonism toward a party, or
when the judge assumes an adversarial role (see, e.g., Powell v. Fletcher,
01-22-00640-CV (Tex. App. Nov 26, 2024)). Ordering the opposing party to
file a sanctions motion, when not authorized by statute, creates an
appearance of bias and provides a valid basis for seeking the judge’s
recusal.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
No, under Texas law, a regional judge cannot order the opposing party to file
a motion for sanctions in response to a tertiary recusal motion; the statutory
scheme provides for automatic attorney’s fees and costs to the prevailing
party without requiring such a motion. If Judge David L. Evans were to order
the opposing party to file a sanctions motion in this context, it would exceed
his statutory authority, violate due process, and could demonstrate bias
warranting his recusal.

Summary
Texas statutes governing tertiary recusal motions establish a clear, self-
executing process: if a tertiary recusal motion is denied, the judge must
award reasonable attorney’s fees and costs to the party opposing the
motion, and the movant is jointly and severally liable for those amounts.
There is no requirement or authority for the judge to order the opposing
party to file a motion for sanctions, and the statutory language and structure
make clear that the process is intended to be automatic and not adversarial
in this respect.
If a regional judge, such as David L. Evans, were to order the opposing party
to file a motion for sanctions when they have not done so, this would exceed
the judge’s statutory authority, disrupt the neutral administration of the
recusal process, and could be perceived as the judge improperly advocating
for one party. Such conduct would violate due process principles requiring
judicial neutrality and could constitute evidence of bias sufficient to warrant
the judge’s own recusal.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
The controlling law for recusal and disqualification of judges in Texas,
including the specific procedures for tertiary recusal motions, is found in the
Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. Section 30.016 of this Code defines
a tertiary recusal motion as a third or subsequent motion for recusal or
disqualification filed by the same party in a case. Critically, the statute
mandates that if a tertiary recusal motion is denied, the judge must award
reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees and costs to the party opposing the
motion, with the movant and their attorney jointly and severally liable for
those amounts. The statute does not require the opposing party to file a
motion for sanctions; the award of fees and costs is automatic upon denial of
the motion. The statutory language is unequivocal: the judge “shall award”
fees and costs, and there is no statutory provision authorizing or requiring
the judge to order the opposing party to file a motion for sanctions. The
process is self-executing and does not depend on any action by the opposing
party (Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 30.016).
Case Law
Texas appellate courts have interpreted these statutes to reinforce the
automatic nature of the fee-shifting provision and the limited role of the
judge in the recusal process. In In re Champagne (Tex. App. Oct. 27, 2021),
the court emphasized that a trial court’s discretion to impose sanctions is
subject to due process limitations, including the requirement that the person
or party against whom the sanction is sought must receive notice and an
adequate opportunity to respond. The court’s authority to impose sanctions
is not boundless and is limited by due process. This supports the proposition
that a judge cannot unilaterally order a party to file a motion for sanctions

without following due process, as it would violate the statutory and
constitutional requirements for fairness and impartiality.
Secondary Materials
Secondary sources confirm that the statutory scheme is designed to be self-
executing: if a tertiary recusal motion is denied, the judge must award
attorney’s fees and costs to the prevailing party, and there is no requirement
for the opposing party to file a motion for sanctions. The judge’s role is to
apply the statute, not to prompt or direct parties to seek additional
remedies. Furthermore, a judge’s predisposition to rule in a particular
manner or prejudgment of a case can be grounds for disqualification,
especially where judicial bias is alleged (Judicial Bias May Implicate
Lawyer's Ethical Obligations).
Analysis
Statutory Procedure for Tertiary Recusal Motions
The Texas legislature has established a clear, mandatory process for
handling tertiary recusal motions. When such a motion is denied, the judge
is required to award reasonable attorney’s fees and costs to the party
opposing the motion. This process is automatic and does not depend on any
action by the opposing party, such as filing a motion for sanctions (Tex. Civ.
Prac. and Rem. Code § 30.016). The statutory language is unequivocal: the
judge “shall award” fees and costs. There is no statutory provision
authorizing or requiring the judge to order the opposing party to file a
motion for sanctions.
The only context in which a motion for sanctions is contemplated is in other
statutory provisions (not provided in the current materials), which allow a
party (not the judge) to file such a motion if they believe the recusal motion
was filed solely for delay and without sufficient cause. Even then, the judge’s
role is to rule on the motion, not to direct a party to file it.
Judicial Authority and Due Process
The judge’s authority in the context of tertiary recusal motions is thus
strictly limited to the procedures set forth in the statutes. By ordering the
opposing party to file a motion for sanctions, a judge would be acting
outside the scope of their statutory authority and interfering with the
adversarial process. This would constitute a violation of due process, which
requires that judges remain neutral arbiters and not act as advocates for
either party (In re Champagne (Tex. App. Oct. 27, 2021)). Due process, as
articulated in both Texas and federal law, demands that judges avoid even
the appearance of partiality. When a judge takes affirmative steps to prompt
or direct a party to seek sanctions against their opponent, especially when
the statutory scheme does not require or authorize such action, the judge
risks crossing the line from neutral arbiter to advocate. This is precisely the
type of conduct that can undermine public confidence in the judiciary and
violate the due process rights of the parties.

Bias and Grounds for Recusal
Judicial bias sufficient to warrant recusal arises when a judge’s conduct
demonstrates favoritism or antagonism toward a party, or when the judge
assumes an adversarial role. The Texas courts have held that a judge should
not act as an advocate or adversary for any party, and that a clear showing
of bias can constitute a due process violation (Judicial Bias May Implicate
Lawyer's Ethical Obligations). If Judge David L. Evans were to order the
opposing party to file a motion for sanctions in response to a tertiary recusal
motion, this would be a clear departure from the statutory process and could
reasonably be perceived as the judge siding with one party against the
other. Such conduct would not only violate the statutory scheme but also the
fundamental requirement of judicial neutrality. This could provide a valid
basis for seeking Judge Evans’s recusal, as it would raise legitimate
concerns about his impartiality and adherence to due process.
Case Law Application
The case law supports this analysis. In In re Champagne (Tex. App. Oct. 27,
2021), the court confirmed that the authority to impose sanctions is limited
by due process, which includes providing notice and an opportunity to
respond. The judge’s role is to apply the statute, not to prompt or direct
parties to seek additional remedies. Similarly, secondary materials
emphasize that a judge’s predisposition or prejudgment of a case can be
grounds for disqualification, especially where judicial bias is alleged
(Judicial Bias May Implicate Lawyer's Ethical Obligations).
No Authority to Compel Sanctions Motions
There is no statutory or case law authority for a judge to order the opposing
party to file a motion for sanctions in the context of a tertiary recusal
motion. The only context in which a sanctions motion is contemplated is
when a party, on their own initiative, believes that a recusal motion was filed
solely for delay and without sufficient cause. Even then, the judge’s role is
limited to ruling on the motion, not to directing its filing. The judge’s role is
to apply the law, not to prompt or direct parties to seek additional remedies
(Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 30.016).
Implications of Judicial Overreach
If a judge were to order the opposing party to file a motion for sanctions,
this would constitute judicial overreach and a violation of the statutory
scheme. It would also disrupt the adversarial process by placing the judge in
the role of advocate for one party, rather than as a neutral arbiter. This
conduct would violate due process and could provide grounds for recusal
based on bias or the appearance of bias (Judicial Bias May Implicate
Lawyer's Ethical Obligations).

Exceptions and Caveats
There is no exception in the statutory scheme that would permit a judge to
order a party to file a motion for sanctions in the context of a tertiary
recusal motion. The only context in which a sanctions motion is
contemplated is when a party, on their own initiative, believes that a recusal
motion was filed solely for delay and without sufficient cause. Even then, the
judge’s role is limited to ruling on the motion, not to directing its filing. Case
law does recognize that a judge may continue to preside and rule on
motions, including sanctions, after a tertiary recusal motion is filed, but this
authority is exercised within the bounds of the statutory scheme and does
not extend to compelling parties to take adversarial actions (In re
Champagne (Tex. App. Oct. 27, 2021)).
Conclusion
Texas law provides a clear, self-executing process for handling tertiary
recusal motions: if the motion is denied, the judge must award attorney’s
fees and costs to the prevailing party, and the movant is liable for those
amounts. There is no statutory or case law authority for a judge to order the
opposing party to file a motion for sanctions in this context. If Judge David L.
Evans were to do so, it would exceed his statutory authority, violate due
process by undermining judicial neutrality, and could constitute evidence of
bias sufficient to warrant his recusal. The integrity of the recusal process
depends on strict adherence to the statutory scheme and the fundamental
requirement that judges remain neutral arbiters, not advocates for either
party.

Extract
However, whether exercised pursuant to Chapter 10, Rule 13, or its inherent
power, a trial court's discretion to impose sanctions is subject to at least one
important limitation: sanctions may only be imposed when the person or
party against whom the sanction is sought has received notice and an
adequate opportunity to respond. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 10.003
(requiring that 'the court shall provide a party who is the subject of motion
for sanctions... notice of allegations and a reasonable opportunity to respond
to the allegations'); Tex.R.Civ.P. 13 (providing that court shall impose 'an
appropriate sanction' 'upon motion or its own initiative, after notice and
hearing'); Brewer, 601 S.W.3d at 718 (explaining that '[t]he court's inherent
power to sanction is not boundless' and 'is limited by due process').

Summary
The passage emphasizes that a court's authority to impose sanctions is
limited by due process requirements, which include providing notice and an
opportunity to respond. This supports the proposition that a judge cannot
unilaterally order a party to file a motion for sanctions without following due
process, as it would violate the statutory and constitutional requirements for
fairness and impartiality.
Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 30.016 Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code §
30.016 Recusal Or Disqualification of Certain Judges
Extract
A judge hearing a tertiary recusal motion against another judge who denies
the motion shall award reasonable and necessary attorney's fees and costs
to the party opposing the motion. The party making the motion and the
attorney for the party are jointly and severally liable for the award of fees
and costs. The fees and costs must be paid before the 31st day after the date
the order denying the tertiary recusal motion is rendered, unless the order
is properly superseded.
Summary
The statute provides a clear, self-executing process for handling tertiary
recusal motions. If such a motion is denied, the judge is required to award
reasonable attorney’s fees and costs to the party opposing the motion. This
process is automatic and does not depend on any action by the opposing
party, such as filing a motion for sanctions. The statutory language is
unequivocal: the judge “shall award” fees and costs. There is no statutory
provision authorizing or requiring the judge to order the opposing party to
file a motion for sanctions. Therefore, if Judge David L. Evans were to order
the opposing party to file a motion for sanctions, it would exceed his
statutory authority, violate due process by undermining judicial neutrality,
and could constitute evidence of bias sufficient to warrant his recusal.

Extract
Concluding that the petitioners had an 'objectively reasonable fear they
would not receive a fair trial,' the appellate court quoted law for the
proposition that 'a judge’s announced policy or predisposition to rule in a
particular manner is grounds for disqualification.' The court also cited law
for the principle that a judge may not prejudge a case though he or she may

'form mental impressions and opinions during the course of the case.'
Finally, the court concluded that recusal is proper where a trial judge
expressed judicial bias, as here.
Summary
A judge's predisposition to rule in a particular manner or prejudgment of a
case can be grounds for disqualification. This supports the proposition that if
Judge David L. Evans ordered the opposing party to file a motion for
sanctions, it could be perceived as a predisposition or bias, warranting his
recusal.
