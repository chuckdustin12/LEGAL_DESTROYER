Question
EXPLAIN THE VIOLATIONS THAT OCCUR WHEN AN ATTORNEY DOES
NOT PROSECUTE HER CASE AND HAS SOMEONE FILE ALL OF HER
PLEADINGS ON HER BEHALF DESPITE THAT PERSON NEVER MAKING A
FORMAL APPEARANCE OR SIGNING ANYTHING IN THE CASE. ALSO,
THE ATTORNEY CLAIMED SHE WAS RETAINED IN HER INDIVIDUAL
CAPACITY.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
When an attorney fails to prosecute her own case and allows another person
—who neither appears nor signs pleadings—to file all documents on her
behalf, this conduct violates Texas law prohibiting unauthorized practice of
law, breaches procedural rules requiring attorney signatures and
appearances, and may result in sanctions, striking of pleadings, and
potential disciplinary action, regardless of any claim of being retained in an
"individual capacity." Such conduct also implicates ethical duties of candor,
supervision, and diligence, and may constitute misrepresentation to the
court.
Summary
Texas law strictly limits the practice of law to licensed attorneys, and the
preparation or filing of pleadings for another party by a nonlawyer
constitutes unauthorized practice of law (UPL). If an attorney allows a non-
appearing, non-signing individual to file pleadings or otherwise prosecute a
case, this not only facilitates UPL but also violates procedural rules
requiring attorney signatures, proper appearances, and diligent prosecution,
exposing both the attorney and the unauthorized individual to sanctions and
other legal consequences.
The attorney's claim of being retained in an "individual capacity" does not
excuse or alter these requirements, as only licensed attorneys may
represent others in court, and all pleadings must be signed by the attorney
of record. Courts may strike such pleadings, dismiss cases for want of
prosecution, and impose sanctions or contempt for improper filings, while
the attorney may also face professional discipline for failing to supervise, for
misrepresentation, and for aiding UPL.

Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
Texas law, as codified in the Texas Government Code, provides that only
members of the State Bar may practice law in Texas, with limited exceptions
for certain out-of-state attorneys, law students, or graduates under Supreme
Court rules (Tex. Gov’t Code § 81.102). The "practice of law" is broadly
defined to include preparing pleadings or other documents incident to an
action, as well as managing a case on behalf of a client before a judge (Tex.
Gov’t Code § 81.101, as referenced in multiple cases).
In criminal cases, the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure requires that any
pleading or motion filed for a represented defendant must be signed by at
least one attorney of record, and the court must strike unsigned pleadings
unless promptly corrected. Improper filings may result in contempt or
sanctions (Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 1.052).
For administrative proceedings before the State Office of Administrative
Hearings (SOAH), a representative must formally enter an appearance, and
non-Texas attorneys must comply with pro hac vice requirements. The rules
explicitly do not authorize unauthorized practice of law (1 Tex. Admin. Code
§ 155.201).
Case Law
Texas courts have consistently enforced these statutory requirements. The
appellate courts have held that preparing or filing pleadings for another
party, or managing a case on their behalf, constitutes the practice of law and
is strictly limited to licensed attorneys (Swain v. Dobbs, 692 S.W.3d 720 (Tex.
App. 2023); Jimison by Parker v. Mann, 957 S.W.2d 860 (Tex. App. 1997); 
Drew v. Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee, 970 S.W.2d 152 (Tex. App.
1998)). Nonlawyers who prepare or file pleadings for others are engaged in
UPL, and any such filings are subject to being struck (Jimison by Parker v.
Mann, 957 S.W.2d 860 (Tex. App. 1997)).
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12 provides a mechanism for challenging an
attorney’s authority to prosecute or defend a case. If a party believes a case
is being prosecuted or defended without authority, they may file a sworn
motion, and the challenged attorney must prove their authority. If the
attorney cannot do so, the court must refuse to permit the attorney to
appear and strike the pleadings unless an authorized person appears (Ellis v.
Courtney Prince; LVTRise, Inc., 02-25-00162-CV (Tex. App. Aug 14, 2025); In
re Murrin Bros. 1885, Ltd., 603 S.W.3d 53 (Tex. 2019)).
Courts also have inherent authority, as well as authority under Rule 165a, to
dismiss cases for want of prosecution if the case is not diligently prosecuted
(Swain v. Dobbs, 692 S.W.3d 720 (Tex. App. 2023)).
Federal courts applying Texas law have similarly held that only licensed
attorneys may represent others, and that even a valid power of attorney

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
does not permit a nonlawyer to act as counsel (Benavides v. Fed. Dep’t of
Investigation).
Administrative Decisions and Secondary Materials
Administrative decisions and secondary materials reinforce these principles,
emphasizing that attorneys must supervise nonlawyer assistants, maintain
professional responsibility, and disclose the status of nonlawyer participants.
Ghostwriting or undisclosed assistance in preparing pleadings is treated as
misrepresentation to the court and a violation of ethical rules (Chapter 11-II.
CANDOR IN CONTEXT).
Analysis
Unauthorized Practice of Law (UPL)
The central violation in the described scenario is the facilitation of
unauthorized practice of law. Texas law prohibits anyone who is not a
member of the State Bar from practicing law, which includes preparing or
filing pleadings for another party (Tex. Gov’t Code § 81.102; Swain v. Dobbs,
692 S.W.3d 720 (Tex. App. 2023); In re Flores). If an attorney allows a
nonlawyer to prepare and file pleadings, and that person does not make a
formal appearance or sign anything, the nonlawyer is engaging in UPL, and
the attorney is complicit in that violation.
The courts have made clear that even if a nonlawyer is acting under a power
of attorney or other purported agency, this does not authorize them to
practice law (In re Flores; Benavides v. Fed. Dep’t of Investigation). The
filings are defective and subject to being struck, and the nonlawyer may be
subject to civil and criminal penalties for UPL.
Violations of Procedural Rules
Texas procedural rules require that pleadings be signed by the attorney of
record, and that only licensed attorneys or pro se parties may appear in
court (Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 1.052; Swain v. Dobbs, 692 S.W.3d 720 (Tex.
App. 2023); Rodriguez v. Marcus, 484 S.W.3d 656 (Tex. App. 2016)). If
pleadings are filed by someone who is not the attorney of record and who
does not sign or appear, the filings are procedurally improper. The court is
required to strike unsigned pleadings unless promptly corrected, and may
impose sanctions or hold the filer in contempt if the filings are groundless or
made for improper purposes (Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 1.052).
In civil cases, Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12 allows any party to challenge
the authority of an attorney who is prosecuting or defending a case. The
challenged attorney must prove their authority to act; if they cannot, the
court must strike the pleadings unless an authorized person appears (Ellis v.
Courtney Prince; LVTRise, Inc., 02-25-00162-CV (Tex. App. Aug 14, 2025); In
re Murrin Bros. 1885, Ltd., 603 S.W.3d 53 (Tex. 2019)). This rule is designed
to prevent precisely the kind of ghost-filing or unauthorized prosecution
described in the question.

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Failure to Prosecute and Diligence
An attorney who does not personally prosecute her case and delegates all
filings to an unauthorized person is failing to diligently prosecute the case.
Texas courts have inherent authority, as well as authority under Rule 165a,
to dismiss cases for want of prosecution if the case is not diligently pursued
(Swain v. Dobbs, 692 S.W.3d 720 (Tex. App. 2023)). This failure may result in
dismissal of the case, in addition to the procedural and ethical violations
discussed above.
Ethical and Professional Responsibility Violations
Attorneys have a duty to supervise nonlawyer assistants, maintain
professional responsibility for all work performed on their behalf, and
ensure that nonlawyers do not engage in UPL (Drew v. Unauthorized
Practice of Law Committee, 970 S.W.2d 152 (Tex. App. 1998)). Allowing a
nonlawyer to file pleadings without supervision, appearance, or signature
violates these duties. The attorney may be subject to professional discipline
for aiding UPL, failing to supervise, and failing to diligently prosecute the
case.
Undisclosed ghostwriting—where an attorney or another person prepares
pleadings without disclosure or signature—has been treated as a
misrepresentation to the court and a violation of ethical rules regarding
candor and honesty (Chapter 11-II. CANDOR IN CONTEXT). This conduct
may also conceal conflicts of interest and undermine the integrity of the
judicial process.
The "Individual Capacity" Claim
The attorney’s assertion that she was retained in her "individual capacity"
does not alter the analysis. Texas law requires that only licensed attorneys
may represent others in court, regardless of the capacity in which they are
retained (Swain v. Dobbs, 692 S.W.3d 720 (Tex. App. 2023); Jimison by
Parker v. Mann, 957 S.W.2d 860 (Tex. App. 1997)). The requirement for
proper appearance, signature, and authority to act is not affected by the
attorney’s claimed capacity.
Sanctions and Remedies
The consequences of these violations are significant. Courts may strike
pleadings filed by unauthorized persons, dismiss cases for want of
prosecution, and impose sanctions or hold parties in contempt for improper
filings (Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 1.052; Swain v. Dobbs, 692 S.W.3d 720 (Tex.
App. 2023)). Attorneys may also face professional discipline for aiding UPL,
failing to supervise, and misrepresenting to the court (Drew v. Unauthorized
Practice of Law Committee, 970 S.W.2d 152 (Tex. App. 1998); Chapter 11-II.
CANDOR IN CONTEXT).

Exceptions and Caveats
There are limited exceptions to the prohibition on nonlawyers practicing law,
such as for certain out-of-state attorneys admitted pro hac vice, law
students, or graduates under Supreme Court rules (Tex. Gov’t Code §
81.102; 1 Tex. Admin. Code § 155.201). However, these exceptions require
formal compliance with court rules, including formal appearance and, where
applicable, pro hac vice admission. None of these exceptions apply to a
nonlawyer or to a person who does not make a formal appearance or sign
pleadings.
It is also important to note that while nonlawyers may assist attorneys under
direct supervision, the attorney must maintain ultimate responsibility,
supervise all work, and ensure that the nonlawyer’s status is disclosed
(Drew v. Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee, 970 S.W.2d 152 (Tex.
App. 1998)). The scenario described in the question does not meet these
requirements.
Recent Developments
One of the cited cases, In re Autozoners, LLC, 649 S.W.3d 774 (Tex. App.
2022), has been superseded by a subsequent Texas Supreme Court decision
(In re AutoZoners, LLC, 22-0719 (Tex. Apr 26, 2024)). While the earlier case
discussed the unauthorized practice of law by nonresident attorneys and the
requirements for pro hac vice admission, the superseding decision may
affect the specific application of those principles. However, the general rule
that only licensed attorneys may prepare and file pleadings for others, and
that unauthorized practice is prohibited, remains firmly established in Texas
law.
Conclusion
In summary, when an attorney does not prosecute her own case and allows
another person—who does not appear or sign pleadings—to file all
documents on her behalf, this conduct violates Texas statutes prohibiting
unauthorized practice of law, breaches procedural rules requiring attorney
signatures and appearances, and may result in sanctions, striking of
pleadings, dismissal for want of prosecution, and professional discipline. The
attorney’s claim of being retained in an "individual capacity" does not
excuse these violations. Texas law and court rules are clear: only licensed
attorneys may represent others in court, all pleadings must be signed by the
attorney of record, and attorneys must diligently prosecute their cases and
supervise any nonlawyer assistants. Failure to comply with these
requirements undermines the integrity of the judicial process and exposes
both the attorney and the unauthorized individual to significant legal and
professional consequences.

Torres v. Unauthorized Practice of Law Comm. For Supreme Court of Tex.,
05-21-00651-CV (Tex. App. Sep 09, 2022)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Except in limited circumstances not applicable here, a person may not
practice law in the state of Texas unless the person is a member of the state
bar. ... Although rule 7 uses the term 'any party,' it does not permit a legal
entity to appear through an agent who is not a licensed attorney. ... It has
been the law for the better part of two centuries that a corporation may

Summary
The case confirms Texas’s prohibition on non-lawyers representing others in
court and clarifies that Rule 7 does not allow entities to appear through
nonlawyers. While the facts involve a nonlawyer, the principles apply to any
situation where filings are made by a person who is not counsel of record
and not a licensed attorney, implicating unauthorized practice and improper
appearance/representation.

Extract
the preparation of a pleading or other document incident to an action or

the definition is not exclusive... Code § 81.101(b). The statute requires that

Summary
The passages define “practice of law” to include preparing pleadings and
managing litigation, restrict such acts to licensed attorneys, and prohibit
nonlawyers from drafting/filing pleadings or appearing for others. They also
set conditions under which a nonlawyer may assist (direct supervision,
attorney responsibility, disclosure). Thus, if an attorney allows an
unsupervised nonlawyer who makes no appearance or signature to prepare
and file pleadings, it implicates unauthorized practice by the nonlawyer and
violations of the attorney’s supervisory and professional responsibility
duties. The “individual capacity” claim does not alter the statutory
prohibitions.
In re Murrin Bros. 1885, Ltd., 603 S.W.3d 53 (Tex. 2019)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Rule 12 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provides: A party in a suit or
proceeding pending in a court of this state may, by sworn written motion
stating that he believes the suit or proceeding is being prosecuted or
defended without authority, cause the attorney to be cited to appear before
the court and show his authority to act. TEX. R. CIV. P. 12. Upon such a
motion, 'the burden of proof shall be upon the challenged attorney to show
sufficient authority to prosecute or defend the suit on behalf of the other
party.' Id. If the challenged attorney fails to show sufficient authority, 'the
court shall refuse to permit the attorney to appear in the cause, and shall
strike the pleadings if no person who is authorized to prosecute or defend
appears.' Id.
Summary
Rule 12 provides a mechanism to challenge whether a lawsuit is being
prosecuted or defended without proper authority. If an attorney is not the
one actually prosecuting the case and is having a non-appearing, non-
signing person file pleadings, a party can move under Rule 12 to require the
attorney to prove authority. The burden shifts to the challenged attorney to
show authority. If the attorney cannot, the court must prohibit the attorney
from appearing and strike pleadings unless an authorized representative
appears. This directly addresses unauthorized prosecution/defense and
improper filings by a non-appearing actor. It does not itself address all
ethical violations, but it provides the procedural consequence and remedy
for unauthorized representation.

defended without authority, cause the attorney to be cited to appear before

who is authorized to prosecute or defend appears." Tex. R. Civ. P. 12.
Summary
The passage explains the mechanism and consequences when pleadings are
filed or a case is prosecuted/defended by someone lacking proper authority.
If an attorney is effectively having an unauthorized person prosecute the
case (e.g., filing pleadings without appearance or signature), a Rule 12
motion can be brought. The challenged attorney bears the burden to prove
authority; failure results in disallowing the attorney’s appearance and
striking pleadings unless an authorized person appears. This directly speaks
to the violations/defects implicated by using an undisclosed, unauthorized
filer and issues about authority to act.
Benavides v. Fed. Dep't of Investigation
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
By statute, a federal litigant “may plead and conduct their own cases
personally or by counsel.” See 28 U.S.C. § 1654 (emphasis added). Based on
all information before the Court, Barrera is not an attorney authorized to
practice law in Texas or elsewhere. Section 1654 does not permit a non-
attorney to represent a litigant in federal court and even a valid power of
attorney does not permit it. ... “An individual that is not licensed to practice
law cannot use representative devices ‘as an artifice for the unauthorized
practice of law.’” Dutschmann v. City of Waco, No. 6:22-CV-00094-ADA-JCM,
2022 WL 837498, at *1 (W.D. Tex. Jan. 27, 2022) (quoting Weber v. Garza,
570 F.2d 511, 514 (5th Cir. 1978)). Under Texas state law, an individual
engaging in the unauthorized practice of law may be subject to criminal and
civil penalties. See Tex. Pen. Code § 38.123 (Class A misdemeanor); Tex.

the elimination of the unauthorized practice of law by appropriate actions
and methods, including the filing of suits in the name of the committee”).
The Undersigned, however, expresses no opinion on whether Barrera’s
conduct violates Texas law.
Summary
Only licensed counsel may represent a party in federal court; a non-lawyer
cannot file or act on behalf of a litigant, even with a power of attorney. It
also identifies Texas statutes penalizing unauthorized practice. Applied to an
attorney who delegates filings to a non-appearing, non-signing nonlawyer,
this points to violations: unauthorized practice by the nonlawyer; potential
aiding/abetting UPL; violation of signature/appearance rules; and dereliction
of professional duties to prosecute and supervise nonlawyer assistants.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
[7–9] A trial court’s authority to dismiss for want of prosecution stems from
the express authority of Rule 165a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure as
well as from the court’s inherent power to manage its own docket... A trial

prosecuted with due diligence; (2) the case has not been disposed of within

law as the 'preparation of a pleading or other document incident to an action
or special proceeding or the management of the action or proceeding on
behalf of a client before a judge in court.' Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 81.101(a).
Generally, a person may not practice law in the state of Texas unless the
person is a member of the state bar. Id. § 81.102(a)." ... "In addition, though
an individual may appear in court either in person or by an attorney, Tex. R.

on appeal because it constitutes the unauthorized practice of law.' Rodriguez
v. Marcus, 484 S.W.3d 656, 657 (Tex. App.—El Paso, 2016 no pet.).
Summary
The passages establish (1) courts may dismiss when a case is not prosecuted
with due diligence (Rule 165a/inherent power); and (2) preparing and filing
pleadings or managing litigation for another is the practice of law, which
only State Bar members may perform (Gov’t Code §§ 81.101–.102). Rule 7
allows self-representation or representation by a licensed attorney only; non-
lawyers cannot represent others. Thus, having an unappearing, non-signing
non-lawyer prepare/file pleadings constitutes unauthorized practice. If the
attorney of record is not prosecuting and is using a non-lawyer surrogate,

the matter is subject to dismissal for want of prosecution and implicates
UPL facilitation and potential professional-conduct violations. The attorney’s
claim of being retained in an “individual capacity” does not change the
requirement that only licensed lawyers may represent other persons and
that pleadings must be signed by the attorney of record.
Jimison by Parker v. Mann, 957 S.W.2d 860 (Tex. App. 1997)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The Texas legislature defined the practice of law as, among other things, the
preparation of pleadings or other documents incident to an action or special
proceeding or the management of the action or proceeding on behalf of a
client before a judge in court. Tex. Gov.Code Ann. § 81.101(a) (Vernon 1988).
Furthermore, only those persons who are members of the state bar may
practice law in Texas. Tex. Gov.Code Ann. § 81.102(a) (Vernon 1988)...
Moreover, Rule 44 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure does not vitiate §
81.102 of the Texas Government Code... Thus, Rule 44 must be construed in
a manner harmonious with § 81.102 of the Government Code. …
Consequently, Parker had no authority to personally draft, sign, and file the
'Brief of Appellant' or the motion to correct the statement of facts on behalf
of Jimison. Given this, the documents are struck. … Of course, a next friend
who also happens to be a member of the state bar or is otherwise entitled to
practice law may indeed do so…
Summary
The case defines “practice of law” to include preparing and filing pleadings
and managing a case, restricts that practice to licensed Texas lawyers (or
those otherwise authorized by Supreme Court rule), and holds that filings by
a nonlawyer on another’s behalf are unauthorized and must be struck. It
also clarifies that procedural rules cannot override statutory limits on
unauthorized practice.

Summary
In Texas, preparing or filing pleadings or managing a case for another is the
practice of law (Gov’t Code § 81.101), which only State Bar members may do
(§ 81.102). Nonlawyers doing so commit unauthorized practice and may
violate Penal Code § 38.123. A power of attorney does not authorize a
nonlawyer to act as counsel, and a defective POA cannot confer agency.
Thus, if an attorney allows a nonlawyer to draft/file all pleadings without
formal appearance/signature, that nonlawyer is engaged in the unauthorized
practice, and the filings may be improper. This supports potential
professional-conduct violations by the attorney for aiding UPL,
misrepresentation to the tribunal, signature/appearance rule violations, and
failure to competently and diligently prosecute.

Rule 19(d) provides that a court may deny a nonresident attorney's motion
for admission pro hac vice if the court determines one of the following: (1)

Summary
The passages establish that preparing or filing pleadings for a Texas case
constitutes the practice of law (§ 81.101(a)); that a nonresident may not
practice in Texas without pro hac vice admission (§ 81.102; Rule 19), and
placing a nonresident’s involvement on pleadings before admission can

Rodriguez v. Marcus, 484 S.W.3d 656 (Tex. App. 2016)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Under TEX. R. CIV. IV.P.7, an individual may appear in court either in person
or by an attorney. A non-lawyer may not, however, represent another party
in litigation or on appeal because it constitutes the unauthorized practice of
law. Consequently, a corporation may not appear in court through its officers
who are not attorneys.
Summary
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 7 allows individuals to appear pro se or
through licensed counsel. Nonlawyers cannot represent another party; doing
so is unauthorized practice of law. The case also reiterates that entities
cannot appear through nonlawyer agents. While the passage does not
address attorney ethics directly, it supports that having a nonlawyer
prepare, file, or present pleadings for another party without entering an
appearance or signature implicates unauthorized practice and defective
filings under Texas rules requiring attorney/pro se signatures and
accountability.

Summary
The statute requires that any pleading filed for a represented criminal
defendant be signed by at least one attorney of record. If someone who is
not attorney of record files pleadings without signing or appearing, the
papers are defective and must be stricken unless promptly corrected.
Improper filings can trigger contempt and sanctions if done for improper
purposes or with groundless statements. The rule applies regardless of the
attorney’s claimed “individual capacity.”

of Parties
Extract
(a) Representation. A party may represent himself or herself or may appear
by authorized representative. ... (b) Appearance by authorized
representative. A party's authorized representative who has not entered an
appearance as a matter of record in the proceeding shall enter an
appearance by filing with SOAH appropriate documentation that contains
the representative's mailing address, email address and telephone number.
If the party's representative is not licensed to practice law in Texas and the
authority of the representative is challenged, the representative must show
authority to appear as the party's representative. ... (c) Nonresident
attorney. An attorney who is a resident of and licensed to practice law in

another state and who is not an active member of the State Bar of Texas
shall comply with the requirements of Tex. Gov't Code § 82.0361 and Rule
XIX ... before entering an appearance on behalf of a party at SOAH. ... (d)
Attorney in charge. When more than one attorney makes an appearance on
behalf of a party, the attorney whose signature first appears on the initial
pleading for a party shall be the attorney in charge ... (e) This rule does not
allow a person to engage in the unauthorized practice of law.
Summary
SOAH requires any authorized representative to formally enter an
appearance with contact information; non-Texas lawyers must comply with
pro hac vice requirements before appearing; the first-signing lawyer is
attorney in charge; and the rule expressly does not authorize unauthorized
practice of law. If an attorney has someone file pleadings without that
person entering an appearance or signing, it contravenes the appearance
requirement and risks unauthorized practice. If the filer is a nonresident
attorney, pro hac vice compliance is required. The rule’s scope is limited to
SOAH; parallel duties in courts would arise from Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure and Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct, but those
are outside this passage.
Chapter 11-II. CANDOR IN CONTEXT
Professional Responsibility in Litigation (ABA) - American Bar
Association
Extract
See Barnett v. LeMaster, 12 F. App'x 774, 778 (10th Cir. 2001) (explaining
that a ghostwriting lawyer's failure to identify himself by signing a pleading,
written motion, or brief 'constitutes a misrepresentation to [the] court by
both the litigant and attorney'); In re W.A.R. LLP, 2012 WL 1576002, at *26
(finding that ghostwriting concealed conflict of interest from the court and
thus violated Rule 8.4(c)); Liguori v. Hansen, No. 2:11-cv-00492-GMN-CWH,
2012 WL 760747, at *5 (\"An attorney participating in 'ghost-writing' is
engaged in conduct involving misrepresentation to the [c]ourt because
another individual is signing pleadings the attorney ... In 2015, the Rhode
Island Supreme Court ... declared that a lawyer may assist a pro se
litigant ... An attorney, however, shall not assist a pro se litigant with the
preparation of pleadings, motions, or other written submissions unless the
attorney signs the document and discloses thereon his or her identity and
the nature and extent of the assistance ... The attorney shall also indicate ...
that his or her signature does not constitute an entry of appearance.)
Summary
The passages address undisclosed ghostwriting: when an attorney drafts or
causes filings without identifying themselves, courts have treated it as
misrepresentation to the tribunal and potentially concealment of conflicts,

violating Rule 8.4(c). They also note a jurisdiction that permits limited-scope
assistance only with disclosure and signature. While not Texas-specific, they
frame the ethical concern directly relevant to an attorney having another
person file pleadings without appearance or signature.
In the Matter of a Disbarred Arizona Supreme Court Member of the State
Bar of Arizona Gary L. Lassen , , Bar No. 5259
Arizona Disciplinary Decisions
Extract
Mr. Hobson was not aware at the time of the filing of the answer of anything
relating to the case. He first became aware of Mr. Lassen signing his name
after he received a call from Assistant Attorney General Jinju Park in early
August, 2014. ... He informed her he does not recall ever allowing or
authorizing Mr. Lassen or anyone else to sign the motion on his behalf. ...
Mr. Hobson was aware that Mr. Lassen was suspended and testified that he
would not allow a suspended attorney to sign a pleading on his behalf.
Summary
The passage shows a scenario where pleadings were signed/ filed in another
attorney’s name without authorization, and by or involving a suspended
lawyer. This implicates violations concerning unauthorized practice of law,
misrepresentation to the tribunal, and improper delegation/ghost-filing
without appearance. While Arizona-specific, the conduct described is
analogous to professional rule violations recognized broadly, including
Texas.
