Question
The complaint asserts that the alleged racketeering activities occurred
across state lines (Texas and Oklahoma) and that a substantial part of the
events took place in the Western District of Oklahoma. Federal courts have
jurisdiction over RICO claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 18 U.S.C. §
1964(c), and venue is proper where a substantial part of the events giving
rise to the claim occurred (28 U.S.C. § 1391). The allegations of interstate
communications, travel, and financial transactions, as well as the location of
key events in the Western District of Oklahoma, establish proper jurisdiction
and venue.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
The allegations of racketeering activities occurring across state lines (Texas
and Oklahoma) establish federal subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.
§ 1331 and 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), while the substantial part of events taking
place in the Western District of Oklahoma establishes proper venue under 
28 U.S.C. § 1391.
Summary
The proposition correctly asserts that federal courts have jurisdiction over
RICO claims based on both 28 U.S.C. § 1331, which grants federal question
jurisdiction for claims arising under federal law, and 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c),
which specifically grants jurisdiction to federal district courts for RICO civil
claims. The interstate nature of the alleged racketeering activities
(occurring across Texas and Oklahoma) satisfies the interstate commerce
requirement fundamental to RICO claims, while the location of a substantial
part of the events in the Western District of Oklahoma properly establishes
venue under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2).
The allegations of interstate communications, travel, and financial
transactions further support both jurisdiction and venue determinations. The
interstate element demonstrates the requisite connection to interstate
commerce for RICO claims, while the location of key events in the Western
District of Oklahoma satisfies the "substantial part" requirement for venue
purposes. Additionally, 18 U.S.C. § 1965 provides specific venue provisions
for RICO claims, which work in conjunction with the general venue statute
to establish the Western District of Oklahoma as a proper venue for this
action.

Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
Federal Question Jurisdiction
Federal courts have "original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the
Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States." 28 U.S.C. § 1331. This
provision establishes federal question jurisdiction, allowing federal courts to
hear cases involving federal statutes such as the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
RICO Civil Remedies
RICO provides specific jurisdictional provisions for civil claims. 18 U.S.C. §
1964(c) states: "Any person injured in his business or property by reason of
a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any
appropriate United States district court and shall recover threefold the
damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable
attorney's fee." This provision explicitly grants jurisdiction to federal district
courts for civil RICO claims.
Additionally, 18 U.S.C. § 1964 provides that "The district courts of the United
States shall have jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violations of section
1962 of this chapter by issuing appropriate orders..." This further
establishes federal court jurisdiction over RICO violations.
Prohibited Activities Under RICO
RICO makes it unlawful to engage in certain racketeering activities affecting
interstate commerce. 18 U.S.C. § 1962 states: "It shall be unlawful for any
person through a pattern of racketeering activity or through collection of an
unlawful debt to acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest in or
control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which
affect, interstate or foreign commerce." The interstate commerce
requirement is essential to establishing federal jurisdiction over RICO
claims.
Venue Provisions
The general venue statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1391, provides that a civil action may
be brought in "a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or
omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property
that is the subject of the action is situated." This establishes the "substantial
part" test for determining proper venue in federal civil cases.
RICO also contains a specific venue provision. 18 U.S.C. § 1965 states: "Any
civil action or proceeding under this chapter against any person may be
instituted in the district court of the United States for any district in which
such person resides, is found, has an agent, or transacts his affairs." This

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
provides additional venue options for RICO civil claims beyond those in the
general venue statute.
Multi-District Offenses
For offenses occurring across multiple districts, 18 U.S.C. § 3237 provides:
"Except as otherwise expressly provided by enactment of Congress, any
offense against the United States begun in one district and completed in
another, or committed in more than one district, may be inquired of and
prosecuted in any district in which such offense was begun, continued, or
completed. Any offense involving the use of the mails, transportation in
interstate or foreign commerce, or the importation of an object or person
into the United States is a continuing offense and, except as otherwise
expressly provided by enactment of Congress, may be inquired of and
prosecuted in any district from, through, or into which such commerce, mail
matter, or imported object or person moves." While primarily addressing
criminal prosecutions, this provision reflects the broad approach to
jurisdiction and venue in cases involving interstate activities.
Case Law
Federal Question Jurisdiction for RICO Claims
Courts have consistently recognized federal question jurisdiction for RICO
claims. In Gibbs v. Stinson, 421 F.Supp.3d 267 (E.D. Va. 2019), the court
stated: "The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions
arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. 28
U.S.C. § 1331. The Amended Complaint alleges violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1962
of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ('RICO')." This
confirms that RICO claims automatically fall under federal question
jurisdiction.
Venue Requirements for RICO Claims
The "substantial part" test for venue has been interpreted broadly by federal
courts. In Kirby-Smith Mach., Inc. v. Holmgren Enters., Inc., NO. CIV-13-374-
HE (W.D. Okla. Nov 27, 2013), the court explained that venue under §
1391(a)(2) "is not limited to the district [where] the most substantial event
or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred." Rather, "the statute
'contemplates that venue can be appropriate in more than one district ...
[and] permits venue in multiple judicial districts as long as a substantial part
of the underlying events took place in those districts.'" The court
emphasized that while some substantial events underlying the claims took
place elsewhere, the plaintiff had shown "the occurrence in this district of
'acts and omissions that have a close nexus to the alleged claims,'" which
satisfied the substantiality requirement and made venue proper in that
district.
Similarly, in D'Addario v. Geller, 264 F.Supp.2d 367 (E.D. Va. 2003), the court
noted that venue is proper "pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), because a
substantial part of the events giving rise to the action occurred in this

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
district, and pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1965." The court further explained that
under § 1391(b), venue is appropriate in "a judicial district in which a
substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred,
or a substantial part of the property that is the subject of the action is
situated." This confirms that both the general venue statute and RICO's
specific venue provision can establish proper venue for RICO claims.
In Gibbs v. Stinson, 421 F.Supp.3d 267 (E.D. Va. 2019), the court further
clarified that "Plaintiffs may establish venue to pursue their RICO claims
under either RICO or the general venue statutes." This demonstrates the
flexibility plaintiffs have in establishing venue for RICO claims, being able to
rely on either the general venue provisions or RICO's specific venue
provisions.
Nationwide Service of Process and Jurisdiction in RICO Cases
RICO's nationwide service of process provision enhances the ability to
establish jurisdiction over defendants in RICO cases. In Dooley v. United
Technologies Corp., 786 F.Supp. 65 (D. D.C. 1992), the court found that
"RICO provides for nationwide service of process under section 1965(d),"
which served as a basis for exercising personal jurisdiction over the
defendants. The court also found that "venue is proper as to the plaintiff's
non-RICO claims under the Court's pendent venue authority" since all claims
arose "out of a common nucleus of operative fact." The court concluded that
"under Title 28, United States Code, section 1391(b) and the pendent venue
doctrine, venue is proper as to the entire complaint."
It should be noted that Dooley v. United Technologies Corp. was stated as
overruled by Myers v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 915 F.Supp.2d 136 (D. D.C. 2013).
However, the overruling likely pertains to specific aspects of the decision
rather than the general principles of RICO jurisdiction and venue, as these
principles are well-established in other cases and the statute itself. Given
the availability of other authorities supporting these principles, the impact
of this negative treatment on the current analysis is minimal.
Interstate Commerce and RICO Jurisdiction
The interstate commerce element of RICO is crucial for establishing federal
jurisdiction. In David v. Signal Intern., LLC, 588 F.Supp.2d 718 (E.D. La.
2008), the court explained that "all RICO claims under § 1962 have three
common elements: (1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern of racketeering
activity, (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control
of an enterprise." The court also noted RICO's "special nationwide service of
process provision," stating that "the relevant inquiry is whether the Dewan
defendants have had minimum contacts with the United States." This
emphasizes the broad reach of RICO's jurisdictional provisions when
activities occur across state lines.
In considering the substance of contacts with a forum, Gutierrez v. Givens, 1
F.Supp.2d 1077 (S.D. Cal. 1998) held that "Economic substance, not
formality, is the proper gauge for determining a defendant's contacts with
the forum state." The court noted that "California contacts created by

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Colonial's interactions with the California defendants are a clear part of the
conspiracy alleged in the FAC. Therefore, Plaintiffs' claims arise out of and
are in part a result of the defendant's forum-related activities." This
supports the importance of substantive contacts in establishing jurisdiction
and venue in RICO cases.
Secondary Materials
A comprehensive explanation of RICO requirements is provided in RICO: A
Primer (2022), which states that "RICO provides for a civil action against
persons engaged in a 'pattern of racketeering activity' or 'collection of an
unlawful debt.'" It explains that a RICO enterprise includes "any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity." Courts
have interpreted "enterprise" broadly to capture both legitimate and
illegitimate enterprises.
The primer further explains that under section 1962(b), "it is a violation to
acquire or maintain an interest in an enterprise affecting interstate or
foreign commerce through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of
an unlawful debt." Similarly, under section 1962(c), "it is a violation to
conduct the affairs of an enterprise affecting interstate or foreign commerce
'through' a pattern of racketeering activity or through the alternative theory
of collection of an unlawful debt." These provisions emphasize the interstate
commerce requirement for RICO violations.
Additional insight is provided by Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024), which
explains that "RICO creates a private cause of action under 18 U.S.C. §
1964(c). To state a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege (1) two or more
predicate racketeering offenses, (2) the existence of an enterprise affecting
interstate commerce, (3) a connection between the racketeering offenses,
and (4) an injury by reason of the above." This clearly identifies the
interstate commerce requirement as a fundamental element of RICO claims.
Analysis
Federal Jurisdiction Over RICO Claims
The proposition correctly asserts that federal courts have jurisdiction over
RICO claims based on two statutory provisions:
Federal Question Jurisdiction (28 U.S.C. § 1331): RICO claims arise
under federal law, specifically 18 U.S.C. § 1962, which prohibits certain
racketeering activities. As the court in Gibbs v. Stinson, 421 F.Supp.3d
267 (E.D. Va. 2019) confirmed, federal courts have original jurisdiction
over RICO claims under § 1331 because they arise under the laws of
the United States.
RICO-Specific Jurisdiction (18 U.S.C. § 1964(c)): This provision
explicitly grants jurisdiction to federal district courts for civil RICO
claims. The statute allows any person injured by a RICO violation to sue
1. 
2. 

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
"in any appropriate United States district court." This creates an
independent basis for federal jurisdiction over RICO claims.
The proposition's statement that "Federal courts have jurisdiction over RICO
claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c)" is therefore fully
supported by the statutory provisions and case law.
Interstate Commerce Requirement
A key element of establishing federal jurisdiction for RICO claims is
demonstrating that the enterprise in question affects interstate commerce.
This requirement is explicitly stated in 18 U.S.C. § 1962, which prohibits
racketeering activities affecting "interstate or foreign commerce."
The allegation that the racketeering activities occurred "across state lines
(Texas and Oklahoma)" directly satisfies this interstate commerce
requirement. Activities spanning multiple states inherently affect interstate
commerce, which is a necessary element for establishing federal jurisdiction
under RICO. As explained in RICO: A Primer (2022), both section 1962(b)
and 1962(c) violations require that the enterprise affects interstate or
foreign commerce. Similarly, Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024) identifies
"the existence of an enterprise affecting interstate commerce" as a required
element of a civil RICO claim.
The "allegations of interstate communications, travel, and financial
transactions" further support the connection to interstate commerce. These
are precisely the types of activities that demonstrate an enterprise affecting
interstate commerce, thereby satisfying this jurisdictional requirement.
Venue in RICO Cases
The proposition asserts that venue is proper in the Western District of
Oklahoma because "a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim
occurred" there. This assertion is based on 28 U.S.C. § 1391, the general
venue statute for federal civil cases.
Under § 1391, venue is proper in "a judicial district in which a substantial
part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred." The key to
this analysis is the "substantial part" test. As explained in Kirby-Smith
Mach., Inc. v. Holmgren Enters., Inc., NO. CIV-13-374-HE (W.D. Okla. Nov
27, 2013), this test does not require that the most substantial events
occurred in the district, only that substantial events did occur there.
Furthermore, venue can be appropriate in multiple districts simultaneously,
as long as substantial events occurred in each district.
The complaint's allegation that "a substantial part of the events took place in
the Western District of Oklahoma" directly satisfies this test. The court in 
Kirby-Smith emphasized that the substantiality requirement is met when
there are "acts and omissions that have a close nexus to the alleged claims"
in the district. The "key events" occurring in the Western District of
Oklahoma would satisfy this requirement.

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Additionally, RICO has its own venue provision in 18 U.S.C. § 1965, which
allows a civil action to be instituted in any district where a defendant
"resides, is found, has an agent, or transacts his affairs." As noted in Gibbs v.
Stinson, 421 F.Supp.3d 267 (E.D. Va. 2019), plaintiffs may establish venue
for their RICO claims under either the RICO venue statute or the general
venue statute. This provides additional flexibility in establishing venue for
RICO claims.
The combination of these provisions strongly supports the proposition's
assertion that venue is proper in the Western District of Oklahoma based on
the substantial events occurring there.
Interstate Activities and Multi-District Offenses
The interstate nature of the alleged racketeering activities further supports
the propriety of venue in the Western District of Oklahoma. Under 18 U.S.C.
§ 3237, offenses begun in one district and completed in another, or
committed in more than one district, may be prosecuted in any district
where the offense was begun, continued, or completed. While primarily
addressing criminal prosecutions, this provision reflects the broad approach
to venue in cases involving interstate activities.
The allegations of activities occurring across state lines (Texas and
Oklahoma), including interstate communications, travel, and financial
transactions, demonstrate the multi-district nature of the alleged RICO
violations. The Western District of Oklahoma, being a district where
substantial events allegedly occurred, would be a proper venue under this
analysis.
Economic Substance of Contacts
In determining the propriety of jurisdiction and venue, courts look to the
economic substance of contacts rather than mere formalities. As stated in 
Gutierrez v. Givens, 1 F.Supp.2d 1077 (S.D. Cal. 1998), "Economic
substance, not formality, is the proper gauge for determining a defendant's
contacts with the forum state." The allegations of interstate
communications, travel, and financial transactions, as well as key events
occurring in the Western District of Oklahoma, demonstrate substantial
economic contacts with that district, further supporting the propriety of
venue there.
Additional Venue Considerations
It's worth noting that even for claims related to but separate from the RICO
claims, venue might still be proper in the Western District of Oklahoma
under the pendent venue doctrine. As explained in Dooley v. United
Technologies Corp., 786 F.Supp. 65 (D. D.C. 1992), venue can be proper for
non-RICO claims under the court's pendent venue authority when all claims
arise "out of a common nucleus of operative fact." While Dooley has been
stated as overruled by Myers v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 915 F.Supp.2d 136 (D.
D.C. 2013), the concept of pendent venue for related claims remains valid in

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
many jurisdictions, though its applicability would depend on the specific
claims involved and the court's approach to pendent venue.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the proposition's assertions about jurisdiction and venue appear well-
supported by the provided authorities, there are some potential exceptions
and caveats to consider:
Pattern of Racketeering Activity Requirement
Jurisdiction and venue in RICO cases depend not only on the interstate
nature of the activities but also on the existence of a "pattern of
racketeering activity." As explained in David v. Signal Intern., LLC, 588
F.Supp.2d 718 (E.D. La. 2008), all RICO claims require proof of "a person
who engages in a pattern of racketeering activity, connected to the
acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise." The
complaint must allege specific predicate acts constituting this pattern.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024) further specifies that a civil RICO claim
requires allegations of "two or more predicate racketeering offenses." If the
complaint fails to adequately allege these predicate offenses, jurisdiction
and venue could be challenged even if the interstate element is satisfied.
Substantiality of Events in the Western District
While venue is proper in any district where a substantial part of the events
occurred, there could be challenges to the substantiality of the events
alleged to have occurred in the Western District of Oklahoma. As noted in 
Kirby-Smith Mach., Inc. v. Holmgren Enters., Inc., NO. CIV-13-374-HE (W.D.
Okla. Nov 27, 2013), the events must have "a close nexus to the alleged
claims." If the events in the Western District are found to be tangential or
insubstantial to the RICO claims, venue might be challenged.
Multiple Proper Venues
It's important to note that under both the general venue statute and the
RICO venue provision, there could be multiple proper venues for the case.
As emphasized in Kirby-Smith, venue "permits venue in multiple judicial
districts as long as a substantial part of the underlying events took place in
those districts." This means that other districts, such as a district in Texas
where some of the alleged activities occurred, could also be proper venues.
The plaintiff's choice of venue might be subject to a motion to transfer venue
under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) if another venue is found to be more convenient
for parties and witnesses.
Conclusion
The proposition's assertion that federal courts have jurisdiction over RICO
claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) is firmly supported by

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the statutory provisions and case law. Federal question jurisdiction applies
to RICO claims because they arise under federal law, and RICO itself
contains a specific jurisdictional provision granting federal district courts
jurisdiction over civil RICO claims.
The assertion that venue is proper where a substantial part of the events
giving rise to the claim occurred is also well-supported by 28 U.S.C. §
1391(b)(2) and relevant case law. The "substantial part" test does not
require that the most substantial events occurred in the district, only that
substantial events did occur there. Additionally, RICO's specific venue
provision in 18 U.S.C. § 1965 provides further support for the propriety of
venue in the Western District of Oklahoma.
The allegations of racketeering activities occurring across state lines (Texas
and Oklahoma) clearly satisfy the interstate commerce requirement
fundamental to RICO claims. The interstate communications, travel, and
financial transactions further demonstrate the connection to interstate
commerce. The location of key events in the Western District of Oklahoma
establishes that district as a proper venue under both the general venue
statute and RICO's specific venue provisions.
In conclusion, based on the provided authorities, the proposition that federal
courts have jurisdiction over the RICO claims in this case and that venue is
proper in the Western District of Oklahoma is legally sound and well-
supported.

Summary
The passage explains that under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(a)(2), venue is proper in
any district where a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim
occurred. It emphasizes that venue can be appropriate in multiple districts
as long as substantial events took place there. This supports the proposition
that the Western District of Oklahoma is a proper venue for the RICO claim,
as substantial events related to the alleged racketeering activities occurred
there.
Gutierrez v. Givens, 1 F.Supp.2d 1077 (S.D. Cal. 1998)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of California
Extract
Economic substance, not formality, is the proper gauge for determining a
defendant's contacts with the forum state. ... The California contacts created
by Colonial's interactions with the California defendants are a clear part of
the conspiracy alleged in the FAC. Therefore, Plaintiffs' claims arise out of
and are in part a result of the defendant's forum-related activities.
Summary
The court in "Gutierrez v. Givens" emphasized the importance of economic
substance over formality in determining a defendant's contacts with a forum
state. This supports the proposition that substantial events related to a
claim, such as interstate communications and financial transactions, can
establish proper jurisdiction and venue. The passage also highlights that
claims can arise from forum-related activities, which aligns with the
proposition's assertion about the Western District of Oklahoma.

U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Virginia
Extract
Plaintiff's complaint alleges that venue is proper in this district on several
grounds. The most relevant bases are pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b),
because a substantial part of the events giving rise to the action occurred in
this district, and pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1965. ... Under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b),
venue is appropriate in 1) a judicial district where any defendant resides, if
all defendants reside in the same State, 2) a judicial district in which a
substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred,
or a substantial part of the property that is the subject of the action is
situated, or 3) a judicial district in which any defendant may be found, if
there is no district in which the action may otherwise be brought.

Summary
The court in "D'Addario v. Geller" discusses the appropriateness of venue
under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) for cases where a substantial part of the events
giving rise to the claim occurred in the district. This supports the
proposition that venue is proper in the Western District of Oklahoma if a
substantial part of the events related to the RICO claim occurred there.
Additionally, the passage references 18 U.S.C. § 1965, which is relevant to
RICO claims, further supporting the jurisdictional basis.
Gibbs v. Stinson, 421 F.Supp.3d 267 (E.D. Va. 2019)

Extract
The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising
under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. 28 U.S.C. §
1331. The Amended Complaint alleges violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1962 of the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ('RICO'). ... Under the
general venue statute, venue is proper where a 'substantial part of the
events...giving rise to the claim occurred.' 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). Plaintiffs may
establish venue to pursue their RICO claims under either RICO or the
general venue statutes.
Summary
Federal courts have original jurisdiction over RICO claims under 28 U.S.C. §
1331, and venue is proper where a substantial part of the events giving rise
to the claim occurred, as per 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). This supports the
proposition that federal courts have jurisdiction over RICO claims and that
venue is proper in the district where significant events related to the claim
took place.
David v. Signal Intern., LLC, 588 F.Supp.2d 718 (E.D. La. 2008)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Louisiana
Extract
The RICO statutory scheme is aimed at combating organized crime—RICO is
located in Title 18 of the criminal code—and the Act imposes criminal and
civil liability upon those who engage in certain 'prohibited activities' which
are listed in 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a) through (c). Each prohibited activity
includes, as one necessary element, proof either of 'a pattern of
racketeering activity' or of 'collection of an unlawful debt.' Regardless of
which subsection the plaintiff relies upon, all RICO claims under § 1962 have
three common elements: (1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern of

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
racketeering activity, (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment,
conduct, or control of an enterprise... As explained above, RICO has a
special nationwide service of process provision. The relevant inquiry is
whether the Dewan defendants have had minimum contacts with the United
States... The Dewan Defendants played a crucial role in recruiting the
plaintiffs for employment in this country. Much of the injury claimed by the
plaintiffs was sustained in this country while they worked at Signal's
facilities.
Summary
Elements required for a RICO claim, emphasizing the need for a pattern of
racketeering activity and the connection to an enterprise. It also highlights
the nationwide service of process provision under RICO, which is relevant
for establishing jurisdiction when defendants have minimum contacts with
the United States. This supports the proposition by illustrating how RICO's
provisions can be applied to cases involving interstate activities and
establishing jurisdiction and venue in federal courts.
Dooley v. United Technologies Corp., 786 F.Supp. 65 (D. D.C. 1992)
U.S. District Court — District of Columbia
Extract
Plaintiff Dooley raises several grounds which he argues give the Court
personal jurisdiction over the defendants. The Court finds two alternative
bases on which to exercise personal jurisdiction over the defendants in this
case. First, the Court finds that RICO provides for nationwide service of
process under section 1965(d)... The Court also finds that venue is proper as
to the plaintiff's non-RICO claims under the Court's pendent venue authority.
All of the plaintiff's claims arise 'out of a common nucleus of operative
fact.'... Consequently, the Court concludes that under Title 28, United States
Code, section 1391(b) and the pendent venue doctrine, venue is proper as to
the entire complaint.
Summary
Court's ability to exercise personal jurisdiction over defendants in a RICO
case through nationwide service of process under section 1965(d). It also
addresses the proper venue for RICO and related claims under section
1391(b) and the pendent venue doctrine, which allows for venue when
claims arise from a common nucleus of operative fact. This supports the
proposition that federal courts have jurisdiction over RICO claims and that
venue is proper where substantial events related to the claim occurred.

The passage from 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) clearly states that a civil action may
be brought in a judicial district where a substantial part of the events or
omissions giving rise to the claim occurred. This directly supports the
proposition that venue is proper in the Western District of Oklahoma if a
substantial part of the events related to the alleged racketeering activities
took place there. The context of the passage is a general provision for
determining venue in federal civil cases, making it broadly applicable to the
situation described in the proposition.

of section 1962 to sue in federal court. This supports the proposition that
federal courts have jurisdiction over RICO claims. The passage also implies
that venue is proper in any appropriate U.S. district court, which aligns with
the proposition that venue is proper where a substantial part of the events
occurred.

Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1962(b) highlights that it is unlawful for any
person to engage in racketeering activities that affect interstate or foreign
commerce. This directly supports the proposition that federal jurisdiction is
appropriate for RICO claims involving activities across state lines, such as
those alleged to have occurred between Texas and Oklahoma. The mention
of activities affecting interstate commerce aligns with the requirement for
federal jurisdiction under RICO, as it demonstrates the interstate nature of
the alleged racketeering activities.

another, or committed in more than one district, may be inquired of and
prosecuted in any district in which such offense was begun, continued, or
completed. Any offense involving the use of the mails, transportation in
interstate or foreign commerce, or the importation of an object or person
into the United States is a continuing offense and, except as otherwise
expressly provided by enactment of Congress, may be inquired of and
prosecuted in any district from, through, or into which such commerce, mail
matter, or imported object or person moves.
Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 3237 provides that offenses that begin in one
district and are completed in another, or that occur in multiple districts, can
be prosecuted in any of those districts. This is particularly relevant for
offenses involving interstate commerce, such as racketeering activities that
cross state lines. The passage supports the proposition by establishing that
federal jurisdiction and venue are appropriate in cases where the alleged
activities span multiple districts, as is the case with the alleged racketeering
activities occurring across Texas and Oklahoma.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
RICO creates a private cause of action under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). To state a
civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege (1) two or more predicate
racketeering offenses, (2) the existence of an enterprise affecting interstate
commerce, (3) a connection between the racketeering offenses, and (4) an
injury by reason of the above.
Summary
The passage outlines the necessary elements to establish a civil RICO claim,
including the requirement that the enterprise affects interstate commerce.
This supports the proposition by highlighting the interstate nature of the
alleged racketeering activities, which is crucial for establishing federal
jurisdiction and venue.

activity... Under section 1962(c), it is a violation to conduct the affairs of an
enterprise affecting interstate or foreign commerce 'through' a pattern of
racketeering activity... Under Section 1962(d), it is a violation to conspire to
commit any of the three substantive RICO offenses.
Summary
Requirements for establishing a RICO violation, emphasizing the necessity
of an enterprise affecting interstate commerce. This supports the
proposition that federal jurisdiction is appropriate for RICO claims involving
interstate activities, such as those alleged to occur between Texas and
Oklahoma. The passage also highlights the broad applicability of RICO to
enterprises affecting interstate commerce, which aligns with the
proposition's assertion of federal jurisdiction and venue based on interstate
activities and events occurring in the Western District of Oklahoma.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
RICO provides for a civil action against persons engaged in a 'pattern of
racketeering activity' or 'collection of an unlawful debt.' ... A RICO
enterprise includes 'any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or
other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity.' Courts have interpreted 'enterprise' broadly, and
the definition captures both legitimate and illegitimate enterprises. ...
Section 1962(b) ... Under section 1962(b), it is a violation to acquire or
maintain an interest in an enterprise affecting interstate or foreign
commerce through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of an
unlawful debt. ... The enterprise engaged in, or its activities affected,
interstate or foreign commerce; ... Section 1962(c) ... Under section 1962(c),
it is a violation to conduct the affairs of an enterprise affecting interstate or
foreign commerce 'through' a pattern of racketeering activity or through the
alternative theory of collection of an unlawful debt.
Summary
The passage explains that RICO provides for civil actions against individuals
engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity, which can include activities
affecting interstate commerce. The broad interpretation of "enterprise" and
the requirement that the enterprise's activities affect interstate commerce
support the proposition that federal jurisdiction is appropriate when
racketeering activities cross state lines. The mention of interstate commerce
aligns with the proposition's assertion of jurisdiction based on activities
occurring across state lines (Texas and Oklahoma).
