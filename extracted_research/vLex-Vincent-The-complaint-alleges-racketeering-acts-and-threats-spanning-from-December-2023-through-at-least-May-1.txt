Question
The complaint alleges racketeering acts and threats spanning from
December 2023 through at least May 2025, with ongoing communications,
threats, and attempts to finalize the divorce and evict Plaintiff. It documents
both the duration and the ongoing nature of the scheme. To satisfy the
continuity requirement for a RICO claim, the complaint must allege either a
closed period of repeated conduct (closed-ended continuity) or conduct that
poses a threat of continued criminal activity (open-ended continuity), as
required by H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell. The complaint’s detailed timeline
and allegations of ongoing threats and coordination demonstrate both
closed- and open-ended continuity, meeting the continuity pleading
requirement for a RICO conspiracy claim.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Based on the legal authorities provided, the complaint's allegations of
racketeering acts and threats spanning from December 2023 through May
2025 (approximately 17 months) likely satisfy the closed-ended continuity
requirement for a RICO claim, and the ongoing nature of the alleged threats
and coordination appears to demonstrate open-ended continuity as well.
Both types of continuity are sufficient to meet the continuity pleading
requirement as established by the Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell.
Summary
The continuity requirement for establishing a pattern of racketeering
activity under RICO can be satisfied by demonstrating either closed-ended
continuity, which refers to "a closed period of repeated conduct" extending
over a substantial period of time, or open-ended continuity, which refers to
"past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of
repetition." In this case, the complaint alleges racketeering acts and threats
spanning approximately 17 months (December 2023 through May 2025),
which likely constitutes a substantial period of time sufficient to establish
closed-ended continuity according to numerous federal courts that have
considered this issue.
Additionally, the complaint's allegations of ongoing threats and coordination,
including attempts to finalize the divorce and evict the Plaintiff, suggest that
the defendants' conduct poses a threat of continued criminal activity
extending into the future, thus potentially satisfying the open-ended
continuity requirement. The demonstration of either type of continuity
would be sufficient to satisfy the RICO continuity requirement as established
by the Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell. However, the fact
that the complaint appears to demonstrate both forms of continuity

strengthens the argument that the continuity pleading requirement for a
RICO conspiracy claim has been met.
Background and Relevant Law
The RICO Continuity Requirement
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) requires a
plaintiff to establish a "pattern of racketeering activity" as part of its claim.
Section 1961(5) of the RICO statute defines a "pattern of racketeering
activity" as requiring "at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which
occurred after the effective date of [the RICO statute] and the last of which
occurred within ten years... after the commission of a prior act of
racketeering activity." Borg v. Warren, 545 F.Supp.3d 291 (E.D. Va. 2021)
("Thus, to show 'a pattern of racketeering activity,' a plaintiff must first
allege 'at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after
the effective date of [the RICO statute] and the last of which occurred within
ten years ... after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity.' 18
U.S.C. § 1961(5).").
However, the U.S. Supreme Court has further interpreted this requirement
to include a "continuity" element. The leading case on this issue is H.J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492 U.S. 229 (1989), where the
Court held that a plaintiff must show that "the racketeering predicates are
related, and that they either constitute or threaten long-term criminal
activity." The Court established that this continuity requirement is "both a
closed- and open-ended concept, referring either to a closed period of
repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition."
Closed-Ended Continuity
Closed-ended continuity refers to a completed scheme that occurred over a
substantial period of time. According to the Supreme Court, "[a] party
alleging a RICO violation may demonstrate continuity over a closed period
by proving a series of related predicates extending over a substantial period
of time." GICC Capital Corp. v. Technology Finance Group, Inc., 67 F.3d 463
(2nd Cir. 1995) ("In H.J. Inc., the Supreme Court outlined the basic contours
of the continuity requirement as follows: 'Continuity' is both a closed- and
open-ended concept, referring either to a closed period of repeated conduct,
or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of
repetition.... A party alleging a RICO violation may demonstrate continuity
over a closed period by proving a series of related predicates extending over
a substantial period of time.").
The Court in H.J. Inc. also specified that "[p]redicate acts extending over a
few weeks or months and threatening no future criminal conduct do not
satisfy this requirement: Congress was concerned in RICO with long-term
criminal conduct." Midwest Grinding Co., Inc. v. Spitz, 769 F.Supp. 1457
(N.D. Ill. 1991) ("A 'party alleging a RICO violation may demonstrate
continuity over a closed period by proving a series of related predicates

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
extending over a substantial period of time;' however, 'predicate acts
extending over a few weeks or months and threatening no future criminal
conduct do not satisfy this requirement.'").
While the Supreme Court did not establish a specific minimum duration for
closed-ended continuity, lower courts have provided some guidance. For
instance, the Second Circuit generally requires at least two years to
establish closed-ended continuity. Democratic Nat'l Comm. v. Russian Fed'n,
392 F.Supp.3d 410 (S.D. N.Y. 2019) ("Predicates have closed-ended
continuity if they 'extend[ed] over a substantial period of time' in the past, 
id. at 242, 109 S.Ct. 2893").
However, there is variation among courts. In Gunderson v. ADM Investor
Services, Inc., No. C96-3148-MWB (N.D. Iowa 2/13/2001), the court found
that a period of "just over two years, from February of 1994, through May
26, 1996" was sufficient to establish closed-ended continuity, stating that
"the lengthy pattern of predicate acts alone 'amounts to' continued criminal
activity."
In Tabas v. Tabas, 47 F.3d 1280 (3rd Cir. 1995), the Third Circuit found that
"conduct lasting three and one-half years was sufficient to establish closed-
ended continuity." It's important to note that Tabas was subsequently
declined to extend by Yucaipa Am. All. Fund I, LP v. Ehrlich, No. 16-3664
(3rd Cir. Nov 15, 2017). However, this subsequent treatment does not
overrule the basic finding that a period of three and a half years is sufficient
to establish closed-ended continuity; rather, the later case declined to
extend the Tabas analysis to a different factual scenario.
By contrast, some courts have found that shorter periods may not be
sufficient. For example, Horace-Manasse v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., CASE
NO. 10-81623-CV-HURLEY (S.D. Fla. Apr 12, 2012) stated that "[t]he
overwhelming weight of case authority suggests that nine months is not an
adequately substantial period of time."
Open-Ended Continuity
Open-ended continuity refers to past conduct that, while perhaps not
extending over a substantial period of time, nonetheless poses a threat of
continued criminal activity in the future. The Supreme Court explained that
"liability depends on whether the threat of continuity is demonstrated." 
GICC Capital Corp. v. Technology Finance Group, Inc., 67 F.3d 463 (2nd Cir.
1995).
There are several ways to establish open-ended continuity. According to 
Cofacredit v. Windsor Plumbing Supply, 187 F.3d 229 (2nd Cir. 1997), "To
satisfy open-ended continuity, the plaintiff need not show that the predicates
extended over a substantial period of time but must show that there was a
threat of continuing criminal activity beyond the period during which the
predicate acts were performed."
One method is to demonstrate that the racketeering acts "include a specific
threat of repetition extending indefinitely into the future." World Wrestling

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Entertainment v. Jakks Pacific, 530 F.Supp.2d 486 (S.D. N.Y. 2007) ("A party
alleging open-ended continuity must show that 'the racketeering acts
themselves include a specific threat of repetition extending indefinitely into
the future [or] ... are part of an ongoing entity's regular way of doing
business.'").
Alternatively, a plaintiff can show that the predicate acts "are part of an
ongoing entity's regular way of doing business." Ubuy Holdings, Inc. v.
Gladstone, 340 F.Supp.2d 1343 (S.D. Fla. 2004) ("If relying instead on open
ended continuity, a plaintiff must allege 'either that the racketeering acts
themselves include a specific threat of repetition extending
indefinitely into the future,' or that the predicate acts or offenses
are part of an ongoing entity's regular way of doing business.'").
Either Type of Continuity Is Sufficient
Courts have consistently held that a plaintiff can satisfy the continuity
requirement by demonstrating either closed-ended or open-ended continuity. 
Boritzer v. Calloway, 10 Civ. 6264 (JPO) (S.D. N.Y. Jan 24, 2013) ("The
continuity required to make this pattern showing may be of the 'closed-
ended' or 'open-ended' variety, either of which is sufficient under the
statute.").
Similarly, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (2005-03-22)
states that "Either closed-ended or open-ended continuity satisfies the
continuity test in these circuits."
Analysis
Application to the Complaint's Allegations
The complaint alleges racketeering acts and threats spanning from
December 2023 through at least May 2025, with ongoing communications,
threats, and attempts to finalize the divorce and evict the Plaintiff. This
period covers approximately 17 months. The question is whether these
allegations are sufficient to satisfy either the closed-ended or open-ended
continuity requirement or both.
Closed-Ended Continuity Analysis
For closed-ended continuity, the primary consideration is whether the
alleged racketeering acts extend over a "substantial period of time." While
the Supreme Court has not specified an exact minimum duration, lower
courts have provided some guidance.
The alleged period of 17 months (December 2023 through May 2025) falls
between the periods that courts have found to be sufficient and insufficient.
For instance, the guidance from the Second Circuit generally suggests that
two years (24 months) are required for closed-ended continuity, which would
mean that 17 months might be insufficient in that jurisdiction. However,
other courts might find this period to be substantial enough.

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
In Lujan v. Mansmann, 956 F.Supp. 1218 (E.D. Pa. 1997), the court stated
that "With regard to closed-ended conduct, the related predicates must
extend over a substantial period of time, generally exceeding one year."
Since the complaint alleges a period of approximately 17 months, this would
exceed the one-year threshold mentioned in Lujan, potentially satisfying the
closed-ended continuity requirement in jurisdictions following similar
standards.
Additionally, as noted in World Wrestling Entertainment v. Jakks Pacific, 530
F.Supp.2d 486 (S.D. N.Y. 2007), "In determining whether continuity exists
the court should not limit its consideration to the duration of the scheme,
but should also look at the overall context in which the acts took place."
Therefore, even if the 17-month period is considered borderline, the court
might also consider the nature and context of the alleged acts, including
their frequency and the number of victims, to determine if closed-ended
continuity is established.
Open-Ended Continuity Analysis
For open-ended continuity, the focus is on whether the alleged conduct
poses a threat of continued criminal activity in the future, rather than the
duration of past conduct.
The complaint's allegations of "ongoing communications, threats, and
attempts to finalize the divorce and evict Plaintiff" suggest that the
defendants' conduct may pose a threat of continued criminal activity
extending beyond the period already alleged. If the alleged racketeering
acts are ongoing and show no sign of completing, this could establish open-
ended continuity.
As explained in Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
(2010-03-22), "Open-ended continuity in the RICO context is conduct that
may last only a short period of time but nonetheless poses a threat of
extending into the future." The complaint's allegations of ongoing threats
and coordination appear to align with this definition.
Furthermore, if the complaint alleges that the defendants' racketeering acts
are a regular part of how they conduct business or carry out their activities,
this could also establish open-ended continuity, as noted in Stewart v.
Associates Consumer Discount Co., 1 F.Supp.2d 469 (E.D. Pa. 1998) ("Open-
ended continuity may be satisfied where it is shown that the predicates are a
regular way of conducting defendant's ongoing legitimate business or of
conducting or participating in an ongoing and legitimate RICO enterprise.").
Meeting the Continuity Requirement
Based on the analysis above, the complaint's allegations appear to
potentially satisfy both closed-ended and open-ended continuity, although
closed-ended continuity may be more borderline depending on the
jurisdiction's specific standards.

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
For closed-ended continuity, the 17-month period from December 2023 to
May 2025 may be considered a "substantial period of time" by some courts,
particularly those that consider periods exceeding one year to be sufficient.
For open-ended continuity, the complaint's allegations of ongoing threats
and coordination, including attempts to finalize the divorce and evict the
Plaintiff, suggest that the defendants' conduct poses a threat of continued
criminal activity extending into the future, which would satisfy this
requirement.
As noted earlier, demonstrating either form of continuity would be sufficient
to satisfy the RICO continuity requirement. Reynolds v. Condon, 908 F.Supp.
1494 (N.D. W.Va. 1996) ("'Continuity' can be shown in one of two ways—
closed-ended continuity or open-ended continuity.").
The fact that the complaint appears to demonstrate both forms of continuity
strengthens the argument that the continuity pleading requirement for a
RICO conspiracy claim has been met. This dual satisfaction of both closed-
ended and open-ended continuity provides redundancy in the pleading,
making it more likely to withstand scrutiny.
Exceptions and Caveats
Jurisdictional Variations
It's important to note that different jurisdictions may have different
standards for what constitutes a "substantial period of time" for closed-
ended continuity. While some courts may find 17 months to be sufficient,
others, particularly those following the Second Circuit's guidance that
generally requires at least two years, might consider it insufficient.
The Nature of the Alleged Racketeering Acts
The analysis above assumes that the alleged acts qualify as "racketeering
acts" under the RICO statute. If some of the alleged acts do not qualify as
predicate acts under RICO, this could affect the continuity analysis. The
complaint must allege at least two qualifying racketeering acts within the
relevant period to establish a pattern.
The Relatedness Requirement
In addition to continuity, the Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. also emphasized that
the alleged racketeering acts must be related. Reich v. Lopez, 858 F.3d 55
(2nd Cir. 2017) ("The Supreme Court has interpreted that phrase to require
both that the RICO predicates pose a threat of continuous criminal activity
and that they be related to each other."). The analysis above focuses solely
on the continuity requirement and assumes that the relatedness
requirement is also met.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Open-Ended Continuity and Completed Schemes
If the alleged scheme is determined to have been completed or to have a
definite endpoint, this might undermine a finding of open-ended continuity,
as noted in Stewart v. Associates Consumer Discount Co., 1 F.Supp.2d 469
(E.D. Pa. 1998). However, the complaint's allegations of "ongoing
communications, threats, and attempts to finalize the divorce and evict
Plaintiff" suggest that the scheme is still ongoing and does not have a
definite endpoint.
Conclusion
Based on the legal authorities provided, the complaint's allegations of
racketeering acts and threats spanning from December 2023 through at
least May 2025, along with ongoing communications, threats, and attempts
to finalize the divorce and evict the Plaintiff, appear to satisfy both closed-
ended and open-ended continuity requirements for establishing a pattern of
racketeering activity under RICO.
For closed-ended continuity, the 17-month period may be considered a
"substantial period of time" by some courts, particularly those that consider
periods exceeding one year to be sufficient, although it might be borderline
in jurisdictions that generally require at least two years.
For open-ended continuity, the complaint's allegations of ongoing threats
and coordination suggest that the defendants' conduct poses a threat of
continued criminal activity extending into the future, which would satisfy
this requirement.
Since demonstrating either form of continuity would be sufficient to satisfy
the RICO continuity requirement, and the complaint appears to demonstrate
both, this strengthens the argument that the continuity pleading
requirement for a RICO conspiracy claim has been met.
The complaint's detailed timeline and allegations of ongoing threats and
coordination, therefore, appear to meet the continuity pleading requirement
as established by the Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell, which
requires a showing of either "a closed period of repeated conduct" (closed-
ended continuity) or "conduct that poses a threat of continued criminal
activity" (open-ended continuity).

"'Continuity' is both a closed- and open-ended concept, referring either to a
closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature
projects into the future with a threat of repetition." H.J., 492 U.S. at 241. "A
party... may demonstrate continuity over a closed period by proving a series
of related predicates extending over a substantial period of time." Id.

of time." Jackson, 372 F.3d at 1266.
Summary
The passage explains the concept of continuity in RICO claims,
distinguishing between closed-ended and open-ended continuity. It
emphasizes that continuity can be demonstrated by a series of related
predicates over a substantial period or by showing a threat of continued
criminal activity. The passage supports the proposition by aligning with the
requirement that a RICO claim must demonstrate either closed-ended or
open-ended continuity, as outlined in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell. The
complaint in question alleges acts spanning from December 2023 to May
2025, which is a substantial period, and includes ongoing threats,
suggesting both closed- and open-ended continuity.

U.S. District Court — District of Hawaii
Extract
According to Northwestern Bell, 'to establish a RICO pattern it must ... be
shown that the predicates themselves amount to, or that they otherwise
constitute a threat of, continuing racketeering activity.' 492 U.S. at 240, 109
S.Ct. at 2901. The Northwestern Bell Court also explained that there are two
alternative ways to satisfy the continuity prong: 'Continuity' is both a closed-
and open-ended concept, referring either to a closed period of repeated
conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a
threat of repetition.' Id. at 241, 109 S.Ct. at 2902.
Summary
The continuity requirement for a RICO claim can be satisfied by
demonstrating either closed-ended continuity (a series of related predicates
over a substantial period) or open-ended continuity (conduct that poses a
threat of continued criminal activity). The passage from Streck v. Peters
references the Supreme Court's decision in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell,
which is a key authority on the continuity requirement for RICO claims. This
supports the proposition by confirming that the complaint's allegations of

ongoing threats and coordination can meet the continuity requirement if
they demonstrate either closed- or open-ended continuity.

Summary
Requirements for establishing a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO,
specifically the need to demonstrate either closed-ended or open-ended
continuity. It cites the Supreme Court's decision in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern
Bell, which is a key authority on this issue. The passage explains that closed-
ended continuity involves a series of related predicates over a substantial
period, while open-ended continuity involves a threat of continued criminal
activity. This directly supports the proposition that the complaint must allege
either type of continuity to meet the RICO pleading requirements.

this requirement.'
Summary
The continuity requirement for a RICO claim can be satisfied by
demonstrating either closed-ended continuity (a series of related predicates
over a substantial period) or open-ended continuity (a threat of continued
criminal activity). The passage from Midwest Grinding Co., Inc. v. Spitz
reiterates the principles established in H.J. Inc., which are directly relevant
to the proposition. The complaint in question alleges a timeline and ongoing
nature of racketeering acts that could potentially satisfy both closed- and
open-ended continuity.

Continuity requires proof of 'related predicates extending over a substantial

229, 242 (1989) (noting that proof that predicate acts are 'part of an
ongoing entity's regular way of doing business' may suffice to meet
'continuity' requirement). ... Thus, where, as here, the Producers have
alleged predicate acts during a period of just over two years, from February
of 1994, through May 26, 1996, the lengthy pattern of predicate acts alone
'amounts to' continued criminal activity.
Summary
Continuity requirement for a RICO claim, which can be satisfied by
demonstrating either closed-ended continuity (a series of related predicates
over a substantial period) or open-ended continuity (a threat of continued
criminal activity). The passage cites H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell, which is a
key authority on this issue. The example given in the passage of a two-year
period of predicate acts being sufficient to establish continuity supports the
proposition that a complaint alleging acts from December 2023 through May
2025 could meet the continuity requirement.

Thus, to show 'a pattern of racketeering activity,' a plaintiff must first allege
'at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the
effective date of [the RICO statute] and the last of which occurred within ten
years ... after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity.' 18
U.S.C. § 1961(5). Additionally, the plaintiff 'must show ‘continuity plus
relationship,’ i.e., ‘that the racketeering predicates are related, and that
they amount to or pose a threat of continued activity.’ ... The continuity
requirement — 'centrally a temporal concept' — ensures that only 'long-term
criminal conduct' will fall within the ambit of this statute. ... The Supreme
Court has further explained that the 'continuity' requirement 'is both a
closed- and open-ended concept, referring either to a closed period of
repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition.' ... Thus, a plaintiff bringing a civil RICO
claim must either demonstrate closed-ended continuity 'by proving a series
of related predicates extending over a substantial period of time' or open-
ended continuity by proving that the defendant's prior acts threaten
continued racketeering activity.
Summary
The passage outlines the requirements for establishing a pattern of
racketeering activity under RICO. It emphasizes the need for continuity,
which can be demonstrated through either closed-ended or open-ended
continuity. This directly supports the proposition by explaining how the
complaint's timeline and allegations can meet the continuity requirement for
a RICO claim.

In explicating how a plaintiff could make this continuity showing, the Court
described continuity as 'both a closed- and open-ended concept, referring
either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its
nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.' ... Moreover, even
if we were not to have found that conduct lasting three and one-half years
was sufficient to establish closed-ended continuity, we conclude that
continuity still would have been established for the purposes of summary
judgment in the present case under an 'open-ended' continuity analysis.
Under H.J. Inc., if a RICO action is brought before a plaintiff can establish
long-term criminal conduct, the 'continuity' prong may still be met if a
plaintiff can prove a threat of continued racketeering activity.

Similarly flawed is another of defendants' assertions of a lack of 'continuity,'
this time defendants' assertion that there is no allegation of 'continued
criminal activity.' This argument was disposed of by the next reported
decision after Police Retirement Sys., which again relies upon the Supreme
Court's decision in H.J. Inc. In Lange v. Hocker, 940 F.2d 359 (8th Cir.1991),
the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals held that continuity can be shown in one
of two ways—closed-ended continuity or open-ended continuity. 'A party
alleging a RICO violation may demonstrate continuity over a closed period
by proving a series of related predicates extending over a substantial period
of time.' H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 242, 109 S.Ct. at 2902. Where continuity
cannot be established in such a manner, a RICO violation may be shown
when a 'threat of continuity is demonstrated.' Id. (emphasis in original).
Summary
Concept of continuity in RICO claims, referencing the Supreme Court's
decision in H.J. Inc. It explains that continuity can be demonstrated through
either closed-ended continuity (a series of related predicates over a
substantial period) or open-ended continuity (a threat of continued criminal
activity). This directly supports the proposition that the complaint's timeline
and allegations can meet the continuity requirement for a RICO claim.
World Wrestling Entertainment v. Jakks Pacific, 530 F.Supp.2d 486 (S.D. N.Y.
2007)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of New York
Extract
The continuity necessary to prove a pattern can be either `closed-ended
continuity,' or `open-ended continuity.' ... In determining whether continuity
exists the court should not limit its consideration to the duration of the
scheme, but should also look at the overall context in which the acts took
place. ... A party alleging open-ended continuity must show that `the
racketeering acts themselves include a specific threat of repetition
extending indefinitely into the future [or] ... are part of an ongoing entity's
regular way of doing business.' H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 242, 109 S.Ct. 2893.
Summary
The continuity requirement for a RICO claim can be satisfied by
demonstrating either closed-ended or open-ended continuity. The passage
emphasizes that the court should consider not only the duration but also the
overall context of the acts. It also clarifies that open-ended continuity
involves a threat of repetition or being part of an ongoing business practice.
This aligns with the proposition that the complaint's detailed timeline and
ongoing nature of the scheme can demonstrate both types of continuity.

GICC Capital Corp. v. Technology Finance Group, Inc., 67 F.3d 463 (2nd Cir.
1995)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Second Circuit
Extract
In H.J. Inc., the Supreme Court outlined the basic contours of the continuity
requirement as follows: 'Continuity' is both a closed- and open-ended
concept, referring either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to past
conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of
repetition.... A party alleging a RICO violation may demonstrate continuity
over a closed period by proving a series of related predicates extending over
a substantial period of time. Predicate acts extending over a few weeks or
months and threatening no future criminal conduct do not satisfy this
requirement: Congress was concerned in RICO with long-term criminal
conduct. Often a RICO action will be brought before continuity can be
established in this way. In such cases, liability depends on whether the
threat of continuity is demonstrated.
Summary
The continuity requirement for a RICO claim can be satisfied by
demonstrating either closed-ended continuity (a series of related predicates
over a substantial period) or open-ended continuity (past conduct with a
threat of future repetition). The passage directly supports the proposition by
explaining the continuity requirement as outlined by the Supreme Court in
H.J. Inc., which is the standard referenced in the proposition.

106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
RICO's legislative history, however, establishes that Congress intended that
to prove a 'pattern of racketeering activity' a plaintiff or prosecutor must
show both 'relationship' and 'continuity'—that the racketeering predicates
are related, and that they either constitute or threaten long-term criminal
activity. Pp. 237-239.
Summary
The U.S. Supreme Court has clarified that to establish a "pattern of
racketeering activity" under RICO, there must be both a relationship and
continuity in the alleged racketeering acts. The continuity can be
demonstrated by showing that the acts either constitute or threaten long-

Summary
The passage from "Gott v. Simpson" references the Supreme Court's
interpretation in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell, which is directly relevant to
the proposition. It explains the requirement for a "pattern of racketeering
activity" under RICO, emphasizing the need for related predicates that
either demonstrate a closed period of repeated conduct or pose a threat of
continued criminal activity. This aligns with the proposition's assertion that
the complaint must demonstrate both closed- and open-ended continuity.

Whether the predicate acts constitute a threat of continued racketeering
activity depends on the specific facts of each case. Tabas v. Tabas, 47 F.3d
1280, 1295 (3rd Cir.1995). While predicate acts extending over a few weeks
or months and threatening no future criminal conduct do not satisfy this
requirement, open-ended continuity may be satisfied where it is shown that
the predicates are a regular way of conducting defendant's ongoing
legitimate business or of conducting or participating in an ongoing and

legitimate RICO enterprise. H.J., Inc., 492 U.S. at 243, 109 S.Ct. at 2902;

Summary
The continuity requirement for a RICO claim can be satisfied by
demonstrating either closed-ended or open-ended continuity. The passage
references the H.J. Inc. case, which is a leading authority on the continuity
requirement, and explains that open-ended continuity can be shown if the
predicate acts are a regular way of conducting business or participating in a
RICO enterprise. This supports the proposition that the complaint's
allegations of ongoing threats and coordination can meet the continuity
requirement.

U.S. District Court — Southern District of Florida
Extract
In determining whether alleged unlawful action has this required continuity,
the United States Supreme Court held that such continuity may be 'closed'
or 'open ended.' H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 241,
109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989). If a plaintiff relies on closed period
continuity, that plaintiff must allege 'a series of related predicates extending
over a substantial period of time.' Id. at 242, 109 S.Ct. 2893. If relying
instead on open ended continuity, a plaintiff must allege 'either that `the
racketeering acts themselves include a specific threat of repetition
extending indefinitely into the future,' or that `the predicate acts or offenses
are part of an ongoing entity's regular way of doing business.'
Summary
Requirements for establishing continuity in a RICO claim, referencing the
Supreme Court's decision in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell. It explains that
continuity can be either closed-ended, requiring a substantial period of
related predicates, or open-ended, requiring a threat of ongoing criminal
activity. This directly supports the proposition by providing the legal
framework necessary to argue that the complaint's timeline and allegations
meet the continuity requirement for a RICO claim.
Bardsley v. POWELL, TRACHTMAN, LOGAN, CARRLE, 916 F.Supp. 458
(E.D. Pa. 1996)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Pennsylvania

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Confronted with the question of what constitutes a pattern of racketeering
activity, the Supreme Court examined RICO and its legislative history and
concluded that a 'pattern' required 'continuity plus relationship;' that is, a
plaintiff must plead and prove 'that the racketeering predicates are related,
and that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.' H.J.
Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 2900,
106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989). Thus, RICO was enacted not to address sporadic
activity, but instead to combat 'activities that amount to or threaten long-
term criminal activity.' ... Continuity means that the alleged racketeering
scheme must either be open-ended, that is threatening continuing
racketeering activity, or close-ended but lasting a substantial period of time.
Summary
The Supreme Court's interpretation of RICO requires a pattern of
racketeering activity to demonstrate "continuity plus relationship." This
means that the alleged racketeering acts must be related and either pose a
threat of continued criminal activity (open-ended continuity) or have
occurred over a substantial period of time (closed-ended continuity). The
passage supports the proposition by affirming that the complaint's detailed
timeline and allegations of ongoing threats and coordination can
demonstrate both closed- and open-ended continuity, thus meeting the
continuity pleading requirement for a RICO conspiracy claim.
Qantel Corp. v. Niemuller, 771 F.Supp. 1361 (S.D. N.Y. 1991)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of New York
Extract
To state a claim under the RICO statute, a plaintiff must allege a 'pattern' of
racketeering activity, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), which is defined by the statute as
two or more acts of racketeering activity within a ten-year period. ... the
Supreme Court further expounded upon the pattern requirement in RICO
cases, holding that 'RICO's legislative history reveals Congress' intent that
to prove a pattern of racketeering activity a plaintiff or prosecutor must
show that the racketeering predicates are related, and that they amount to
or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.' H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell
Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989)
(emphasis in original). With respect to the 'continuity' element of the test for
a RICO 'pattern,' the Supreme Court has held that 'continuity' is both a
closed- and open-ended concept, referring either to a closed period of
repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition.... A party alleging a RICO violation may
demonstrate continuity over a closed period by proving a series of related
predicates extending over a substantial period of time.

Summary
The Supreme Court's interpretation of the RICO statute requires
demonstrating a pattern of racketeering activity, which includes showing
continuity. This continuity can be either closed-ended, involving a series of
related predicates over a substantial period, or open-ended, involving a
threat of continued criminal activity. The passage directly supports the
proposition by explaining the requirements for continuity in a RICO claim,
as established in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell.

U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Pennsylvania
Extract
To comply with the 'continuity' prong of the analysis, the complaint must
allege 'continuity of racketeering activity, or its threat.' Id. (citation omitted).
Continuity may be either closed-ended, referring 'to a closed period of
repeated conduct,' or open-ended, meaning 'past conduct that by its nature
projects into the future with a threat of repetition.' Id. (citation omitted).
With regard to closed-ended conduct, the related predicates must extend
over a substantial period of time, generally exceeding one year. Tabas, 47 F.
3d at 1293.
Summary
Closed-ended continuity generally requires the related predicates to extend
over a substantial period of time, typically exceeding one year. This aligns
with the proposition's assertion that the complaint documents both the
duration and ongoing nature of the scheme, thus meeting the continuity
requirement for a RICO conspiracy claim.

Summary
Requirements for establishing a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO,
specifically addressing the continuity requirement. It explains that
continuity can be demonstrated through either closed-ended or open-ended
continuity, as established in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell. This directly
supports the proposition by confirming that a complaint must allege either a
closed period of repeated conduct or a threat of continued criminal activity
to meet the continuity requirement for a RICO claim.
Reich v. Lopez, 858 F.3d 55 (2nd Cir. 2017)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Second Circuit
Extract
The Supreme Court has interpreted that phrase to require both that the
RICO predicates pose a threat of continuous criminal activity and that they
be related to each other. H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239, 109
S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989). Since RICO only requires a combination
of two or more predicate acts, 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5), Reich can mix-and-match
predicate acts in an attempt to identify a pattern of racketeering activity
that has both 'continuity' and 'relatedness.'
Summary
The Supreme Court's interpretation in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell is
crucial for understanding the continuity requirement in RICO claims. The
passage confirms that a pattern of racketeering activity must demonstrate
both continuity and relatedness, which aligns with the proposition's
assertion that the complaint must allege either closed-ended or open-ended
continuity. The passage also highlights that a combination of predicate acts
can establish this pattern, supporting the proposition's claim of ongoing
threats and coordination.
Cofacredit v. Windsor Plumbing Supply, 187 F.3d 229 (2nd Cir. 1997)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Second Circuit
Extract
To establish a pattern, a plaintiff must also make a showing that the
predicate acts of racketeering activity by a defendant are 'related, and that
they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.' See H.J., Inc.
v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239 (1989). ... To satisfy open-

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
ended continuity, the plaintiff need not show that the predicates extended
over a substantial period of time but must show that there was a threat of
continuing criminal activity beyond the period during which the predicate
acts were performed. ... Where the enterprise is engaged primarily in
racketeering activity, and the predicate acts are inherently unlawful, there is
a threat of continued criminal activity, and thus open-ended continuity.
Summary
The continuity requirement for a RICO claim can be satisfied by
demonstrating either closed-ended or open-ended continuity. The passage
explains that open-ended continuity can be established by showing a threat
of continued criminal activity, which aligns with the proposition's assertion
that the complaint demonstrates ongoing threats and coordination. The
reference to H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell further supports the legal
framework for continuity in RICO claims.

Summary
Two types of continuity required under RICO: closed-ended and open-ended.
Closed-ended continuity involves a series of related acts over a substantial
period, while open-ended continuity involves acts that pose a threat of
continuing into the future. The complaint in question alleges acts from
December 2023 to May 2025, which could demonstrate closed-ended
continuity due to the substantial period. Additionally, the ongoing nature of
threats and attempts to finalize the divorce and eviction could demonstrate
open-ended continuity, as they pose a threat of continued criminal activity.
The passage supports the proposition by explaining how both types of
continuity can be established, aligning with the complaint's allegations.

Second, “continuity” may be satisfied by either a series of related predicate
acts extending over a significant period of time (closed-ended conspiracy),
or a short-lived series of acts that also establish a threat of long-term
activity (open-ended conspiracy). A plaintiff may prove this “threat” of
continued racketeering activity by showing that the predicate acts are part
of the RICO defendant’s “regular way of doing business” or that they are “a
regular means of conducting or participating in an ongoing RICO
enterprise.” The Court called for case-by-case examination of this issue.
Although “continuity” and “relationship” are two distinct concepts, the
Court has recognized that evidence of these two prongs will often overlap.
