Question
The judge issued orders on a day the court was publicly closed, without a
hearing, and without jurisdictional basis, and failed to recuse despite
evidence of bias and document tampering. Judicial acts taken without
jurisdiction or in violation of mandatory procedural requirements are
considered ultra vires and void (see Bradley v. McCrabb, 1 Tex. 343 (1846);
Ex parte Sealy, 870 S.W.2d 663, 667 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1994,
orig. proceeding)). Orders issued under these circumstances are void ab
initio and cannot form the basis for further proceedings; the case should be
dismissed or federal intervention sought.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
Orders issued by a judge without jurisdiction, on a day the court is closed,
and without a hearing are considered void ab initio and cannot form the
basis for further proceedings. Such orders are ultra vires, and the
appropriate remedy is often dismissal or seeking mandamus relief.
Summary
In Texas, judicial orders issued without jurisdiction or in violation of
mandatory procedural requirements are considered void from the outset.
This principle is supported by numerous cases, including In re RDF Agent,
LLC and In re Tex. Dep't of Fam. & Protective Serv., which emphasize that
orders issued beyond a court's jurisdiction are void ab initio and warrant
mandamus relief. The lack of jurisdiction can arise from various factors,
such as issuing orders on a day the court is closed, failing to hold a
necessary hearing, or acting outside the court's plenary power.
The concept of void orders is well-established in Texas law, and such orders
cannot be ratified or confirmed. They are nullities and cannot form the basis
for further legal proceedings. In cases where a judge issues orders without
jurisdiction, the appropriate remedy is often to seek mandamus relief to
vacate the void orders. Additionally, if there is evidence of bias or document
tampering, these factors further support the argument for voiding the
orders and potentially seeking federal intervention.
Background and Relevant Law
Case Law
The principle that judicial acts taken without jurisdiction or in violation of
mandatory procedural requirements are void is well-established in Texas
case law. In In re RDF Agent, LLC (14-23-00967-CV, Tex. App. Dec 31, 2024),

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the court emphasized that void orders constitute an abuse of discretion and
warrant mandamus relief. The court noted that when an order is void, it is
unnecessary for the relator to demonstrate a lack of adequate appellate
remedy, reinforcing the idea that such orders cannot form the basis for
further proceedings.
Similarly, In re Tex. Dep't of Fam. & Protective Serv. (696 S.W.3d 240, Tex.
App. 2024) supports the proposition that orders issued beyond a court's
jurisdiction are void ab initio. The court recognized that mandamus relief is
appropriate in such situations, as void orders are considered nullities from
the outset.
In In re Florence (01-20-00556-CR, Tex. App. Jan 24, 2023), the court
reiterated that if a judge lacks authority or jurisdiction, any orders issued
are void. The court emphasized the judge's ministerial duty to vacate such
orders, aligning with the proposition that judicial acts taken without
jurisdiction are ultra vires and void.
The case of Custom Corporates v. Security Storage, Inc. (207 S.W.3d 835,
Tex. App. 2006) further supports this principle by stating that a court order
is void if the court lacks jurisdiction over the parties, subject matter, or the
capacity to act. The court emphasized that a void order is entirely null and
cannot be ratified or confirmed.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the principle of void orders is well-established, there are exceptions
and caveats to consider. For instance, in Spigener v. Wallis (80 S.W.3d 174,
Tex. App. 2002), the court discussed the implications of a judge's
constitutional disqualification, stating that any orders rendered by such a
judge are void. However, this case was later declined to be followed by In re
Benavides (403 S.W.3d 370, Tex. App. 2013), which may impact its authority.
Similarly, Hennessy v. Marshall (682 S.W.2d 340, Tex. App. 1984) was
disapproved by Banque Libanaise Pour Le Commerce v. Khreich (915 F.2d
1000, 5th Cir. 1990), which may affect its applicability. Despite these
subsequent treatments, the core principle that orders issued without
jurisdiction are void remains largely intact.
Analysis
The scenario presented involves a judge issuing orders on a day the court
was publicly closed, without a hearing, and without jurisdictional basis.
These actions align with the circumstances under which orders are
considered void ab initio. The lack of jurisdiction can arise from various
factors, such as issuing orders outside the court's plenary power or failing to
hold a necessary hearing.
In In re RDF Agent, LLC, the court emphasized that orders issued outside
the trial court's plenary power are typically void because the court no longer
has jurisdiction to act. This directly applies to the scenario where orders

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
were issued on a day the court was closed, as the court would lack the
authority to act on such a day.
Furthermore, the failure to hold a hearing before issuing orders can also
render them void. In Hennessy v. Marshall, the court demonstrated that
when a court issues an order without a plenary suit or hearing, the order is
considered void and of no effect. This supports the argument that the orders
in question are void due to the lack of a hearing.
The presence of bias or document tampering further supports the argument
for voiding the orders. In Spigener v. Wallis, the court emphasized that
orders rendered by a judge who is constitutionally disqualified are void.
While this case was later declined to be followed, the principle that bias or
disqualification can render orders void remains relevant.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the orders issued by the judge in the scenario presented are
likely void ab initio due to the lack of jurisdiction, the absence of a hearing,
and the presence of bias or document tampering. These factors align with
the well-established principle in Texas law that judicial acts taken without
jurisdiction or in violation of mandatory procedural requirements are ultra
vires and void. The appropriate remedy is often to seek mandamus relief to
vacate the void orders, and if necessary, federal intervention may be sought
to address any constitutional violations.
Legal Authorities
Patino v. Tex. Dep't of Ins.-Div. of Workers' Comp., 631 S.W.3d 163 (Tex. App.
2020)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
For the ultra vires exception to apply, the suit must allege and ultimately
prove that the state official acted without legal authority or failed to perform
a purely ministerial act, rather than attack the official's exercise of
discretion. Id. at 372. A government official acts 'without legal authority,'
and thus ultra vires, if he exceeds the bounds of his granted authority or
acts in conflict with the law itself. Hall v. McRaven, 508 S.W.3d 232, 238
(Tex. 2017).
Summary
Legal basis for challenging actions taken by officials that exceed their
granted authority or conflict with the law.
Luttrell v. El Paso Cnty., No. 08-16-00090-CV (Tex. App. Dec 20, 2017)

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
An ultra vires claim based on actions taken 'without legal authority' has two
fundamental components: '(1) authority giving the official some (but not
absolute) discretion to act and (2) conduct outside of that authority.' See
Hall v. McRaven, 508 S.W.3d 232, 239 (Tex. 2017) (citing Houston Belt &
Terminal Ry. Co. v. City of Houston, 487 S.W.3d 154, 158 (Tex. 2016)). This
exception applies when a government officer with some discretion to
interpret and apply a law acts 'without legal authority, and thus ultra vires, if
he exceeds the bounds of his granted authority or if his acts conflict with the
law itself.' Hall, 508 S.W.3d at 238 (citing Hous. Belt, 487 S.W.3d at 158)
(internal quotations omitted). The basic justification for this ultra vires
exception to immunity is that ultra vires acts—or those acts without
authority—should not be considered acts of the state at all. Id. (citing Cobb
v. Harrington, 144 Tex. 360, 190 S.W.2d 709, 712 (1945)). Consequently,
ultra vires suits do not attempt to exert control over the State—they attempt
to reassert the control of the State over one of its agents. Id. (citing
Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d at 372).
Summary
Legal basis for challenging actions taken by a judge without proper
authority, aligning with the proposition's argument that such orders are void
ab initio.
Hennessy v. Marshall, 682 S.W.2d 340 (Tex. App. 1984)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
It is undisputed that in the present case no plenary suit was filed and no
plenary hearing held on the issue of whether the English judgment was
conclusive, and therefore entitled to recognition and enforcement. As a
consequence, the trial court's order of September 17, 1984, which
purported to recognize the judgment as a Texas judgment, was void and of
no effect. Likewise, all subsequent orders from the trial court based on the
September 17, 1984, order were also void, including the October 1, 1984,
order.
Summary
The passage from "Hennessy v. Marshall" demonstrates that when a court
issues an order without a plenary suit or hearing, the order is considered
void and of no effect. This aligns with the proposition that judicial acts taken
without jurisdiction or in violation of mandatory procedural requirements
are ultra vires and void. The case further supports the idea that subsequent

orders based on such void orders are also void, reinforcing the proposition
that such orders cannot form the basis for further proceedings.
Custom Corporates v. Security Storage, Inc., 207 S.W.3d 835 (Tex. App.
2006)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A court order is void if it is apparent that the court 'had no jurisdiction of the
parties or property, no jurisdiction of the subject matter, no jurisdiction to
enter the particular judgment, or no capacity to act.' Browning v. Prostok,
165 S.W.3d 336, 346 (Tex.2005) (citing Browning v. Placke, 698 S.W.2d 362,
363 (Tex.1985) (orig.proceeding) (per curiam)). '[A] trial court cannot act
when it has no jurisdiction, and a reviewing court cannot find jurisdiction
where none exists.' ... Because the order is void, it cannot be enforced
against appellants Custom Corporates, Inc. and Theresa Woods. See In re
Bokeloh, 21 S.W.3d 784, 792-93 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2000, orig.
proceeding) ('A void order is entirely null within itself; it is not susceptible to
ratification or confirmation, and its nullity cannot be waived.')
Summary
The passage from "Custom Corporates v. Security Storage, Inc." discusses
the concept of void orders, emphasizing that a court order is void if the
court lacks jurisdiction over the parties, subject matter, or the capacity to
act. It further states that a void order is null and cannot be ratified or
confirmed. This directly supports the proposition that judicial acts taken
without jurisdiction or in violation of procedural requirements are void.
State ex rel. Cobb v. Godfrey, 739 S.W.2d 47 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987)
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
In Garcia v. Dial, 596 S.W.2d 524 (Tex.Cr.App.1980), the trial court had
granted the defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment. The trial court
later entered an order attempting to reinstate the indictment. This Court
held that once the indictment was dismissed, the trial court lost jurisdiction
over the cause and had no power to enter any further orders. ... The trial
court lacked authority to grant the defendant's motion for new trial after the
motion had been overruled by operation of law, and such action was a
nullity.

Summary
The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has established precedent that when a
court acts beyond its jurisdiction or in violation of procedural rules, such
actions are considered nullities. This supports the proposition that judicial
acts taken without jurisdiction or in violation of mandatory procedural
requirements are void.
Zarate v. Sun Operating Limited Inc., 40 S.W.3d 617 (Tex. App. 2001)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
If a judge is disqualified under the Constitution, he is absolutely without
jurisdiction in the case, and any judgment rendered by him is void, without
effect, and subject to collateral attack. See id. at 559. A judgment entered in
a case in which the judge is disqualified is void and not binding as to the
parties involved.
Summary
The passage from Zarate v. Sun Operating Limited Inc. discusses the
consequences of a judge being disqualified under the Texas Constitution. It
states that if a judge is disqualified, they are without jurisdiction, and any
judgment they render is void and subject to collateral attack. This directly
supports the proposition that judicial acts taken without jurisdiction or in
violation of mandatory procedural requirements are considered ultra vires
and void.

"Mandamus is [also] proper if a trial court issues an order beyond its
jurisdiction." In re Sw. Bell Tel. Co., 35 S.W.3d 602, 605 (Tex. 2000) (orig.

mandamus relief is appropriate because such an order is void ab initio." In
re Panchakarla, 602 S.W.3d 536, 539 (Tex. 2020) (orig. proceeding). When
the trial court’s order is void, "the relator need not show that it did not have
an adequate appellate remedy, and mandamus relief is appropriate." In re

Summary
The Texas Court of Appeals recognizes that orders issued by a trial court
beyond its jurisdiction are considered void ab initio. This supports the
proposition that judicial acts taken without jurisdiction or in violation of
mandatory procedural requirements are ultra vires and void. The passage
also indicates that mandamus relief is appropriate in such situations,
reinforcing the idea that such orders cannot form the basis for further
proceedings.
In re Florence, 01-20-00556-CR (Tex. App. Jan 24, 2023)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
"If a trial judge lacks authority or jurisdiction to take a particular action, the
judge has a 'ministerial' duty to refrain from taking that action, to reject or
overrule requests that he take such action, and to undo the action if he has
already taken it." Id. (quoting In re Gambling Devices, 496 S.W.3d at 164).
"In other words, a trial court has a ministerial duty to vacate a void order."
Id.; see State ex rel. Thomas v. Banner, 724 S.W.2d 81, 85 (Tex. Crim. App.
1987) (orig. proceeding) ("Absent proper jurisdiction, it was the trial court's
ministerial duty to vacate the orders."). A court order is void if the record
shows that the court had no jurisdiction over the parties, no subject-matter
jurisdiction, no jurisdiction to enter the order, or no capacity to act as a
court. Gault, 2022 WL 4830811, at *6. That is, "when a judge... lacks
authority to issue an order, the order is void." Id.; see State ex rel. Holmes v.
Salinas, 784 S.W.2d 421, 427-28 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990) (orig. proceeding)
("Because [the trial court] did not have the authority to issue the orders, the
orders are void."). Mandamus relief is available when a court issues a void
order outside of the court's statutory authority. Gault, 2022 WL 4830811, at
*7.
Summary
The passage clearly states that if a judge lacks jurisdiction or authority, any
orders issued are void. It emphasizes the judge's ministerial duty to vacate
such orders. This directly supports the proposition that judicial acts taken
without jurisdiction or in violation of mandatory procedural requirements
are considered ultra vires and void. The passage also mentions that
mandamus relief is available for void orders, aligning with the proposition's
suggestion of seeking dismissal or federal intervention.

Extract
Mandamus to compel a court to vacate or expunge a void order is a
commonly used procedural vehicle to attack discovery orders. An order is
deemed void when rendered by a court having no jurisdiction or authority,
State v. Ferguson, 133 Tex. 60, 125 S.W.2d 272 (1939), when the order is
violative of some constitutional right of a party, or is rendered as a result of
an abuse of discretion by a judicial officer.
Summary
Legal basis for challenging such orders, aligning with the proposition's
argument that orders issued under these circumstances are void ab initio.
Greiner v. Jameson, 865 S.W.2d 493 (Tex. App. 1993)

A judgment is void when the trial court lacks: (1) jurisdiction of the parties
or property; (2) jurisdiction of the subject matter; (3) jurisdiction to enter
the judgment; or (4) the capacity to act as a court. Browning v. Placke, 698
S.W.2d 362, 363 (Tex.1985, orig. proceeding). All other errors render a
judgment voidable.

Sutphin v. Tom Arnold Drilling Contr., 17 S.W.3d 765 (Tex. App. 2000)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Sutphin argues that rule 329b of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure limits
Texas trial courts to thirty days to take any action in a cause, or against
parties and counsel, other than to set aside a void judgment... The trial
court, regardless of whether an appeal has been perfected, has plenary
power to grant a new trial or to vacate, modify, correct, or reform the
judgment within thirty days after the judgment is signed. Tex. R. Civ. P.
329b(d)... Sutphin cites additional cases that rely on rule 329b(d) of the
Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. They illustrate the same proposition: Trial
court orders vacating or modifying a judgment in the original dispute after
the expiration of plenary jurisdiction are void.

Summary
Limitations on a Texas trial court's jurisdiction, specifically under Rule
329b(d) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. It highlights that a trial
court's orders issued after the expiration of its plenary jurisdiction are void.
This supports the proposition that judicial acts taken without jurisdiction are
considered ultra vires and void.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The issuance of a void order is an abuse of discretion and '[c]ases involving
void orders present a circumstance warranting mandamus relief.' Custom
Corps., Inc. v. Sec. Storage, Inc., 207 S.W.3d 835, 838 (Tex. App.-Houston
[14th Dist.] 2006, orig. proceeding); see also, e.g., In re Fluid Power Equip.,
Inc., 612 S.W.3d 130, 136-37 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2020, orig.
proceeding). 'When the order is adjudged void, it is not necessary for a
relator to additionally show that it lacks an adequate appellate remedy.'
Custom Corps., Inc., 207 S.W.3d at 838; see also In re Fluid Power Equip.,
Inc., 612 S.W.3d at 136. Orders issued outside the trial court's plenary
power typically are void because the court no longer has jurisdiction to act
once its plenary power has expired.
Summary
Concept of void orders, which are considered an abuse of discretion and
warrant mandamus relief. It emphasizes that when an order is void, it is not
necessary to show a lack of adequate appellate remedy. This aligns with the
proposition that judicial acts taken without jurisdiction or in violation of
mandatory procedural requirements are ultra vires and void. The passage
also notes that orders issued outside the trial court's plenary power are
typically void, supporting the idea that such orders cannot form the basis for

Amaya argues that the State waived the issue of the trial court's jurisdiction
by failing to object either after receiving notice of his petition for non-
disclosure or a copy of the trial court's order. However, a relator, including
the State, need not object to an order issued by a trial court prior to filing a
petition for a writ of mandamus in an appellate court when the order is void.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
When a court that lacks subject-matter jurisdiction issues a judgment
beyond dismissal of the cause, the judgment is void. See PNS Stores, Inc. v.
Rivera, 379 S.W.3d 267, 273 (Tex. 2012); Zarate v. Sun Operating Ltd., Inc.,
40 S.W.3d 617, 621 (Tex. App.-San Antonio Feb. 7, 2001, pet. denied).
Summary
The passage from the "Sanchez v. Roberts Truck Ctr. of Tex., LLC" case
supports the proposition by affirming that judgments issued by a court
lacking subject-matter jurisdiction are void. This aligns with the proposition
that judicial acts taken without jurisdiction are considered ultra vires and
void. The case law cited in the passage further reinforces this principle,
making it applicable to the situation described in the proposition.

Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
Furthermore, it is likewise axiomatic that where there is no jurisdiction, 'the
power of the court to act is as absent as if it did not exist,' Ex parte
Caldwell, supra at 589, and any order entered by a court having no
jurisdiction is void. E. g., Ex parte Sandoval, supra; Ex parte Armstrong,
supra. We accordingly conclude that, after respondent Dial dismissed the
indictment against petitioner, the jurisdiction of the district court in Cause
Number 78-CR-1183 was exhausted and the order entered thereafter
purporting to reinstate that cause was void and of no effect.
Summary
The passage from "Garcia v. Dial" clearly states that any order entered by a
court without jurisdiction is void. This directly supports the proposition that
judicial acts taken without jurisdiction are considered ultra vires and void.
The case further illustrates that once jurisdiction is exhausted, any
subsequent orders are null and void, reinforcing the idea that such orders
cannot form the basis for further proceedings.
