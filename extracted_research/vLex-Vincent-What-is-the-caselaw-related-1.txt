Question
What is the caselaw related to arbitration under the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR)?
Answer (Florida)
Short response
Florida caselaw establishes that, for many disputes involving condominiums and homeowners’ associations, parties must exhaust mandatory nonbinding
arbitration with the Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR) before proceeding to court, and that the DBPR’s authority in arbitration is
defined and limited by statute. Courts have clarified the procedural requirements, the nonbinding nature of most DBPR arbitration, and the boundaries of the
DBPR’s power to interpret or invalidate arbitration agreements.
Summary
Florida courts have consistently held that statutory schemes governing condominiums and homeowners’ associations require parties to submit certain disputes to
nonbinding arbitration administered by the DBPR before initiating litigation. This requirement is designed to promote judicial economy, reduce litigation costs, and
provide a fairer process for unit owners, but does not deprive courts of subject matter jurisdiction, as parties may still seek a trial de novo after arbitration unless
they have agreed to binding arbitration.
Case law also clarifies that the DBPR’s authority is limited to what is expressly provided by statute; the agency cannot, for example, declare arbitration clauses in
contracts void as a matter of public policy outside the scope of its statutory powers. The courts have further articulated the standards for compelling arbitration,
the exhaustion of administrative remedies, and the procedural framework for challenging or enforcing arbitration awards under the Florida Arbitration Code.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
The Florida Statutes and Administrative Code provide a comprehensive structure for arbitration under the DBPR, particularly in the context of condominium and
homeowners’ association disputes. The key statutory provisions are:
Fla. Stat. § 718.1255: Governs alternative dispute resolution for condominium disputes, authorizing the Division of Florida Condominiums, Timeshares, and
Mobile Homes (a division of the DBPR) to conduct nonbinding arbitration and mediation. It sets forth the qualifications for arbitrators, the process for
arbitration, and the finality and admissibility of arbitration decisions. Importantly, unless the parties agree to binding arbitration, the process is nonbinding and
parties may proceed to a trial de novo in court. The statute also requires the DBPR to adopt procedural rules for arbitration and mediation.
Fla. Stat. § 720.311: Applies similar principles to homeowners’ associations, mandating arbitration for certain disputes (notably election and recall disputes)
and referencing the procedures in § 718.1255.
Fla. Stat. § 719.106: Provides for arbitration in cooperative ownership disputes, particularly regarding board member recalls, and requires the board to file a
petition for binding arbitration with the division or initiate court proceedings if a recall is not certified.
Florida Arbitration Code (Fla. Stat. ch. 682): Provides the general framework for arbitration in Florida, including the enforceability of arbitration agreements
(§ 682.02), procedures to compel or stay arbitration (§ 682.03), arbitrator disclosure requirements (§ 682.041), grounds for vacating awards (§ 682.13), and
judicial enforcement of awards (§§ 682.12, 682.15).
Florida Administrative Code (Fla. Admin. Code Ann. R. 61B-45, 61B-50, 61B-80): Sets out detailed procedural rules for arbitration of disputes under the
DBPR, including the scope of eligible disputes, filing requirements, and the processing of arbitration petitions.
Case Law
Florida appellate courts have addressed several recurring issues regarding arbitration under the DBPR:
Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies and Precondition to Litigation: Courts have repeatedly affirmed that, for certain disputes (especially those
involving condominium terminations, board authority, or association actions), parties must first seek nonbinding arbitration through the DBPR before filing suit
in court. Failure to do so can result in dismissal for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
Nature and Effect of DBPR Arbitration: The arbitration is generally nonbinding unless the parties agree otherwise. The process is intended to be a
cost-effective, efficient alternative to litigation, but does not preclude a party from seeking a trial de novo in court. The courts have clarified that this
requirement is procedural and does not deprive the courts of subject matter jurisdiction.
Limits on DBPR Authority: The DBPR’s authority to interpret or invalidate arbitration provisions is limited to what is expressly provided by statute. The
agency cannot, for example, declare arbitration clauses void as a matter of public policy through declaratory statements outside its statutory mandate.
General Arbitration Principles: Florida courts apply the general principles of arbitration law, including the requirement that arbitration is a matter of contract,
the need for a valid agreement to arbitrate, and the standards for compelling or refusing arbitration.
Analysis

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
1. Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies and Precondition to Litigation
Florida law requires that, before initiating litigation over certain condominium and homeowners’ association disputes, parties must first submit the dispute to
nonbinding arbitration administered by the DBPR. This requirement is codified in Fla. Stat. § 718.1255 for condominiums and § 720.311 for homeowners’
associations, and is reinforced by the Florida Administrative Code.
The courts have strictly enforced this exhaustion requirement. In Cornerstone 417, LLC v. Cornerstone Condo. Ass'n, Inc., 300 So.3d 1262 (Fla. App. 2020), the
court affirmed the dismissal of a unit owner’s complaint for failure to timely file a petition for mandatory nonbinding arbitration with the DBPR before proceeding to
court, as required by statute. The court emphasized that the statutory scheme mandates exhaustion of the administrative remedy as a precondition to judicial
action in these contexts.
Similarly, in Neate v. Cypress Club Condominium, Inc., 718 So.2d 390 (Fla. App. 1998), the court explained that disputes between unit owners and associations
over board authority must be submitted to nonbinding arbitration before a lawsuit may be filed. The arbitration decision is final unless a party files for a trial de
novo within 30 days, underscoring the procedural nature of the requirement.
Sterling Condominium Ass'n, Inc. v. Herrera, 690 So.2d 703 (Fla. App. 1997) further clarifies that, while the statute requires nonbinding arbitration before
litigation, this does not deprive the circuit court of subject matter jurisdiction. The arbitration process is intended to reduce costs and delays, but parties retain the
right to a trial de novo unless they have agreed to binding arbitration.
These cases collectively establish that exhaustion of DBPR arbitration is a mandatory procedural step for many disputes, and failure to comply can bar judicial
relief.
2. Nature and Effect of DBPR Arbitration
The statutory and regulatory framework, as interpreted by the courts, makes clear that DBPR arbitration is generally nonbinding unless the parties expressly
agree otherwise. The purpose is to provide a fair, efficient, and less costly alternative to litigation, particularly for unit owners who may be at a financial
disadvantage compared to associations.
In Cwelt-2008 Series 1045 LLC v. Park Gardens Ass'n, Inc., 305 So.3d 618 (Fla. App. 2020), the court highlighted the legislative intent behind the statutory
scheme: to increase judicial economy, reduce litigation costs, and provide a more accessible forum for unit owners. The court noted that the DBPR is authorized
to employ attorneys as arbitrators and that the arbitration decision is nonbinding unless the parties agree otherwise. The parties are not foreclosed from seeking a
trial de novo in court.
Sterling Condominium Ass'n, Inc. v. Herrera, 690 So.2d 703 (Fla. App. 1997) also emphasized that the nonbinding nature of the arbitration preserves the parties’
right to a jury trial and does not affect the court’s jurisdiction.
The administrative rules (e.g., Fla. Admin. Code Ann. R. 61B-45.001, 61B-50.101, 61B-80.101) reinforce this structure, specifying that the rules are designed to
ensure just, speedy, and inexpensive resolution of disputes, and clarifying the scope of eligible disputes and the procedures for initiating arbitration.
3. Limits on DBPR Authority
The DBPR’s authority in the context of arbitration is strictly limited to what is provided by statute. In Lennar Homes Inc. v. Dep't of Bus. & Prof'l Regulation, 888
So.2d 50 (Fla. App. 2004), the court reversed a declaratory statement by the DBPR’s Division of Land Sales, Condominiums and Mobile Homes that purported to
declare a mandatory arbitration provision in a condominium purchase agreement void as against public policy. The court held that the Division lacked authority to
make such a broad policy pronouncement through a declaratory statement proceeding, and that its powers are limited to those expressly granted by statute.
This case is significant because it delineates the boundaries of the DBPR’s power: the agency cannot invalidate arbitration clauses or set general policy outside
the scope of its statutory mandate. Its role is to administer the arbitration process as provided by law, not to act as a general arbiter of public policy regarding
arbitration agreements.
4. General Arbitration Principles
Florida courts apply general principles of arbitration law to disputes under the DBPR’s jurisdiction. In Seifert v. US Home Corp., 750 So.2d 633 (Fla. 1999), the
Florida Supreme Court articulated the three elements courts must consider when ruling on a motion to compel arbitration: (1) the existence of a valid written
agreement to arbitrate, (2) the presence of an arbitrable issue, and (3) whether the right to arbitration has been waived. The court emphasized that arbitration is a
matter of contract, and no party can be compelled to arbitrate a dispute they did not agree to arbitrate.
This principle is reinforced by the Florida Arbitration Code, which provides that arbitration agreements are valid and enforceable except on grounds that exist at
law or in equity for the revocation of a contract (Fla. Stat. § 682.02). The Code also sets out procedures for compelling arbitration, staying judicial proceedings,
and challenging or enforcing arbitration awards (Fla. Stat. §§ 682.03, 682.13, 682.12).
The courts have also addressed the severability of arbitration clauses from the rest of a contract, following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Buckeye Check
Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, which held that challenges to the validity of a contract as a whole are for the arbitrator to decide unless the arbitration clause itself is
specifically challenged (The impact of unlicensed contractor activities).
5. Procedural Framework and Eligible Disputes
The Florida Administrative Code provides detailed rules for the arbitration process under the DBPR. For example:
Fla. Admin. Code Ann. R. 61B-45.013: Specifies that only certain disputes are eligible for arbitration, generally those between unit owners and the
association or its board, unless the association is a party to the dispute.

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Fla. Admin. Code Ann. R. 61B-50.105: Sets out the procedure for initiating recall arbitration when board members are recalled in condominiums,
cooperatives, or mobile homeowners’ associations.
Fla. Admin. Code Ann. R. 61B-80.102 and 61B-80.103: Detail the procedures for filing petitions for recall and election dispute arbitration in homeowners’
associations.
Fla. Admin. Code Ann. R. 61B-45.018: Outlines the process for processing arbitration petitions, including jurisdictional determinations and compliance with
filing requirements.
These rules ensure that the arbitration process is accessible, fair, and efficient, and they clarify the types of disputes that fall within the DBPR’s jurisdiction.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the requirement to exhaust DBPR arbitration is generally mandatory for eligible disputes, there are important caveats:
•
The arbitration is nonbinding unless the parties agree otherwise, so parties retain the right to seek a trial de novo in court.
•
The requirement to arbitrate does not deprive the courts of subject matter jurisdiction; it is a procedural precondition, not a jurisdictional bar (Sterling
Condominium Ass'n, Inc. v. Herrera, 690 So.2d 703 (Fla. App. 1997)).
•
The DBPR’s authority is limited to what is expressly provided by statute; it cannot declare arbitration clauses void as a matter of public policy outside its
statutory powers (Lennar Homes Inc. v. Dep't of Bus. & Prof'l Regulation, 888 So.2d 50 (Fla. App. 2004)).
•
Only certain types of disputes are eligible for DBPR arbitration, as defined by statute and administrative rule.
•
The general principles of contract law and the Florida Arbitration Code apply, including the requirement for a valid agreement to arbitrate and the standards for
challenging or enforcing arbitration awards.
Conclusion
Florida caselaw establishes a clear framework for arbitration under the DBPR, particularly in the context of condominium and homeowners’ association disputes.
Parties must generally exhaust mandatory nonbinding arbitration with the DBPR before proceeding to court, but retain the right to a trial de novo unless they have
agreed to binding arbitration. The DBPR’s authority is strictly limited to what is provided by statute, and the courts apply general arbitration principles, including
the requirement for a valid agreement to arbitrate and the severability of arbitration clauses. The procedural rules set out in the Florida Administrative Code
ensure that the arbitration process is fair, efficient, and accessible, but only certain disputes are eligible for arbitration under the DBPR’s jurisdiction. The overall
aim of this framework is to promote judicial economy, reduce litigation costs, and provide a fairer process for unit owners and associations alike.
Legal Authorities
Cornerstone 417, LLC v. Cornerstone Condo. Ass'n, Inc., 300 So.3d 1262 (Fla. App. 2020)
Florida District Court of Appeals
Extract
Cornerstone 417, LLC ('Cornerstone'), appeals the trial court's final judgment dismissing, with prejudice, its complaint against Cornerstone Condominium
Association, Inc., a Florida Not for Profit Corporation as Termination Trustee ('Association'), and LSREF2 OREO (DIRECT), LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability
Company ('Oreo') (collectively, 'Appellees'), for failure to exhaust its administrative remedies. On appeal, Cornerstone argues that the trial court erred in
dismissing the complaint based on its conclusion that Cornerstone was required, pursuant to section 718.117(16), Florida Statutes (2019), to timely file a petition
for mandatory nonbinding arbitration with the Department of Business and Professional Regulations ('DBPR') prior to filing its claim in the circuit court. We affirm.
... Appellees moved to dismiss Cornerstone's complaint, arguing that pursuant to section 718.117(16), Florida Statutes, a unit owner who intends to contest a
condominium termination plan must file a petition for mandatory nonbinding arbitration pursuant to section 718.1255, Florida Statutes (2019), within ninety days
after the date that the termination plan is recorded; otherwise, the owner is barred from prosecuting their claim in the circuit court. The record reflects that
Cornerstone had petitioned for mandatory nonbinding arbitration but that the DBPR dismissed Cornerstone's petition as untimely and procedurally flawed. The
trial court dismissed Cornerstone's complaint.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the requirement under Florida law for a unit owner to file a petition for mandatory nonbinding arbitration with the DBPR before
pursuing a claim in circuit court. This requirement is outlined in section 718.117(16) and section 718.1255 of the Florida Statutes. The case illustrates the
consequences of failing to meet this requirement, as the court dismissed Cornerstone's complaint for not exhausting administrative remedies.

The question remains then, whether there was an agreement between the parties to arbitrate future disputes within the meaning of section 682.02, Florida 
Statutes (1985). Arbitration agreements are valid and enforceable, and public policy favors arbitration as an alternative to litigation. Larry Kent Homes, Inc. v. 
Empire of America FSA, 474 So.2d 868 (Fla. 5th DCA 1985), rev. denied, Anderton v. Larry Kent Homes, Inc., 484 So.2d 7 (Fla.1986). The constitution and

by-laws of a voluntary association, when subscribed or assented to by the members, becomes a contract between each member and the association. Sult v.
Gilbert, 148 Fla. 31, 3 So.2d 729 (1941).
Summary
Enforceability of arbitration agreements under Florida law, specifically referencing section 682.02, Florida Statutes. It highlights that arbitration agreements are
favored by public policy and are enforceable. The passage also notes that the constitution and by-laws of a voluntary association, when agreed to by members,
constitute a binding contract to arbitrate disputes. This is relevant to understanding how arbitration agreements are treated under Florida law, which is pertinent to
the question about arbitration under the Florida DBPR.

Florida District Court of Appeals
Extract
Contract provisions for arbitration of all claims, disputes or other matters arising out of or relating to a construction contract are enforceable in accordance with the
Florida Arbitration Code. Mills v. Robert W. Gottfried, Inc., 272 So.2d 837 (Fla. 4th DCA 1973). Any party to a construction contract subject to the Arbitration Code
may apply to the circuit court for an order to compel arbitration. Section 682.03, Florida Statutes (1977). A motion to compel arbitration requires determination of
the existence of a valid agreement to arbitrate, the existence of arbitrable issues and whether arbitration has been waived. Bigge Crane and Rigging Co. v.
Docutel Corporation, 371 F.Supp. 240 (E.D.N.Y.1973). Any action or proceeding involving an issue subject to arbitration should be stayed if an order for
arbitration or an application thereof has been made.
Summary
Process for compelling arbitration, including the need for a valid agreement, arbitrable issues, and the absence of waiver. It also references relevant case law and
statutory provisions, indicating its applicability to similar cases involving construction contracts.
Cwelt-2008 Series 1045 LLC v. Park Gardens Ass'n, Inc., 305 So.3d 618 (Fla. App. 2020)
Florida District Court of Appeals
Extract
Chapter 718 of the Florida Statutes is known as the Condominium Act. As expressly provided in section 718.102, the purpose of this chapter is: This court has
further recognized that 'the intent of the statute is to increase judicial economy and to reduce the cost of litigation for the parties, especially the unit owner, without
eliminating either party's right to a trial by jury.' Sterling Condo. Ass'n, Inc. v. Herrera, 690 So. 2d 703, 704 (Fla. 3d DCA 1997) (emphasis added). See also §
718.1255(3), Fla. Stat. (2015) (providing: 'The Legislature finds that unit owners are frequently at a disadvantage when litigating against an association. ... The
high cost and significant delay of circuit court litigation faced by unit owners in the state can be alleviated by requiring nonbinding arbitration and mediation in
appropriate cases'). To that end, section 718.1255 provides alternative methods (including nonbinding arbitration) for resolving certain condominium-related
disputes, and authorizes the Division of Florida Condominiums, Timeshares, and Mobile Homes (a division of the Department of Business and Professional
Regulation) to employ attorneys as arbitrators to conduct the arbitration hearings under chapter 718. Section 718.1255 also provides that the decision of an
arbitrator, while final, is nonbinding. The parties are not foreclosed from proceeding in a trial de novo unless the parties have agreed that the arbitration shall be
binding. Finally, and most relevant to the instant case, section 718.1255(4)(a) provides: 'Prior to the institution of court litigation, a party to a dispute shall petition
the division for nonbinding arbitration.'
Summary
Chapter 718 of the Florida Statutes, known as the Condominium Act, provides for nonbinding arbitration as a method to resolve disputes related to
condominiums. This is intended to increase judicial economy and reduce litigation costs. The Division of Florida Condominiums, Timeshares, and Mobile Homes,
part of the DBPR, is authorized to conduct these arbitration hearings. The decision from such arbitration is nonbinding unless agreed otherwise by the parties,
and parties must petition for nonbinding arbitration before proceeding to court litigation.
Paid Prescriptions v. Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services, 350 So.2d 100 (Fla. App. 1977)
Florida District Court of Appeals
Extract
We are unable to agree with the above finding as the basis for enjoining arbitration. As far as has been shown by this record, the legislature has constitutionally 
enacted the Florida Arbitration Code, Chapter 682, Florida Statutes (1975). § 682.02 thereof provides as follows: 'Arbitration agreements made valid, irrevocable, 
and enforceable; scope. Two or more parties may agree in writing to submit to arbitration any controversy existing between them at the time of the agreement, or 
they may include in a written contract a provision for the settlement by arbitration of any controversy thereafter arising between them relating to such contract or 
the failure or refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof. Such agreement or provision shall be valid, enforceable, and irrevocable without regard to the 
justiciable character of the controversy; provided that this act shall not apply to any such agreement or provision to arbitrate in which it is stipulated that this law

shall not apply or to any arbitration or award thereunder.'
Summary
Validity and enforceability of arbitration agreements under the Florida Arbitration Code, Chapter 682, Florida Statutes. It highlights that arbitration agreements are
valid, enforceable, and irrevocable, which is relevant to understanding the legal framework for arbitration in Florida. This is pertinent to the question as it provides
a legal basis for arbitration agreements, which would include those under the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR).
Bari Builders, Inc. v. Hovstone Props. Fla., LLC, 155 So.3d 1160 (Fla. App. 2014)
Florida District Court of Appeals
Extract
Appellant, Bari Builders, Inc., appeals the trial court's denial of its motion to compel arbitration pursuant to a subcontract between it and Appellee, Hovstone
Properties Florida, LLC. Because the subcontract contains an unambiguous arbitration provision, we reverse. ... '[T]here are three elements for courts to consider
in ruling on a motion to compel arbitration of a given dispute: (1) whether a valid written agreement to arbitrate exists; (2) whether an arbitrable issue exists; and
(3) whether the right to arbitration was waived.' Seifert v. U.S. Home Corp., 750 So.2d 633, 636 (Fla.1999). This appeal only concerns the first element—whether
a valid written agreement to arbitrate exists. As this determination rests on the construction of the arbitration provision, we review it under the de novo standard of
review. ... Arbitration clauses are construed according to basic contract interpretation principles. ... 'Arbitration is a preferred method of dispute resolution, so any
doubt regarding the scope of an arbitration clause should be resolved in favor of arbitration.' ... In sum, we hold that under the laws of contract interpretation,
specifically the law favoring the enforcement of an arbitration provision, the presence of an additional dispute resolution clause does not render an otherwise valid
arbitration clause ambiguous if the two can be read in a complementary fashion.
Summary
The passage provides insight into how arbitration clauses are interpreted under Florida law, emphasizing the preference for arbitration as a method of dispute
resolution. It outlines the elements considered by courts when ruling on motions to compel arbitration and highlights the principle that any ambiguity in arbitration
clauses should be resolved in favor of arbitration. This is relevant to understanding how arbitration is approached in legal disputes under the jurisdiction of Florida,
including those potentially involving the DBPR.
Bill Heard Chevrolet Corp. v. Wilson, 877 So.2d 15 (Fla. App. 2004)
Florida District Court of Appeals
Extract
It is now an axiom of federal and Florida law that written agreements to arbitrate are binding and enforceable, and that in the absence of waiver a court must
compel arbitration when an arbitration agreement and an arbitrable issue exist. Public policy favors arbitration as an efficient means of settling disputes, because
it avoids the delays and expenses of litigation. KFC Nat'l Mgmt., 739 So.2d at 631. In view of that public policy, all questions concerning the scope or waiver of
the right to arbitrate should be resolved in favor of arbitration rather than against it. E.g., Royal Prof'l Builders, Inc. v. Roggin, 853 So.2d 520 (Fla. 4th DCA 2003);
Benedict v. Pensacola Motor Sales, Inc., 846 So.2d 1238 (Fla. 1st DCA 2003); Beverly Hills Dev. Corp. v. George Wimpey of Fla., Inc., 661 So.2d 969, 971 (Fla.
5th DCA 1995).
Summary
The case discusses the enforceability of arbitration agreements under both federal and Florida law. It highlights that arbitration is favored as a means of dispute
resolution due to its efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The passage also references other cases that support the notion that any doubts regarding the scope or
waiver of arbitration should be resolved in favor of arbitration. This is relevant to understanding the general legal framework and public policy regarding arbitration
in Florida, which may be applicable to cases under the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR) if they involve arbitration
agreements.
Lennar Homes Inc. v. Dep't of Bus. & Prof'l Regulation , 888 So.2d 50 (Fla. App. 2004)
Florida District Court of Appeals
Extract
Lennar Homes, Inc. (Lennar), appeals a declaratory statement issued by the Department of Business and Professional Regulation, Division of Land Sales,
Condominiums and Mobile Homes (Division), ruling that a mandatory arbitration provision in a condominium purchase and sale agreement is prohibited by
sections 718.111(3), 718.303 and 718.506, Florida Statutes (2002), and that the arbitration language in Lennar's agreement is void as against public policy. For
the reasons that follow, we hold that the Division was without authority to interpret and declare void Lennar's contractual arbitration provision in a declaratory
statement proceeding under section 120.565 and to announce a general policy of far-reaching applicability against arbitration provisions in a declaratory
statement proceeding. Accordingly, we reverse.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The Florida District Court of Appeals found that the DBPR's Division of Land Sales, Condominiums and Mobile Homes did not have the authority to declare a
mandatory arbitration provision in a condominium purchase and sale agreement void as against public policy. The court reversed the Division's declaratory
statement, emphasizing that the Division cannot announce a broad policy against arbitration provisions through a declaratory statement proceeding. This case
clarifies the limits of the DBPR's authority in interpreting and enforcing arbitration provisions in contracts.
Wick v. Orange Park Mgt, LLC, 327 So.3d 369 (Fla. App. 2021)
Florida District Court of Appeals
Extract
The Florida Arbitration Code (FAC) provides: Two or more parties may agree in writing to submit to arbitration any controversy existing between them at the time
of the agreement, or they may include in a written contract a provision for the settlement by arbitration of any controversy thereafter arising between them relating
to such contract or the failure or refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof. § 682.02, Fla. Stat. (2010). In Florida, arbitration agreements are favored. See
Jackson v. Shakespeare Found., Inc., 108 So. 3d 587, 593 (Fla. 2013) ('Courts generally favor [arbitration] provisions, and will try to resolve an ambiguity in an
arbitration provision in favor of arbitration.'). A party to an arbitration agreement may file a motion in the trial court seeking to compel the parties to proceed to
arbitration. See § 682.03(1), Fla. Stat. (2010). When evaluating a motion to compel arbitration, a trial court must consider three factors: '(1) whether a valid written
agreement to arbitrate exists; (2) whether an arbitrable issue exists; and (3) whether the right to arbitrate was waived.'
Summary
Clear explanation of the Florida Arbitration Code's provisions regarding arbitration agreements, including the conditions under which parties may agree to
arbitration and the factors a court must consider when evaluating a motion to compel arbitration. This is relevant to understanding the legal framework for
arbitration under Florida law, which would include cases under the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR).
Seifert v. US Home Corp., 750 So.2d 633 (Fla. 1999)
Florida Supreme Court
Extract
Under both federal statutory provisions and Florida's arbitration code, there are three elements for courts to consider in ruling on a motion to compel arbitration of
a given dispute: (1) whether a valid written agreement to arbitrate exists; (2) whether an arbitrable issue exists; and (3) whether the right to arbitration was
waived. ... A natural corollary of this rule is that no party may be forced to submit a dispute to arbitration that the party did not intend and agree to arbitrate.
Summary
Three key elements that courts consider when ruling on a motion to compel arbitration under Florida's arbitration code. These elements are crucial in determining
whether a dispute is subject to arbitration. The passage also emphasizes that arbitration is a matter of contract interpretation and that parties cannot be forced
into arbitration for disputes they did not agree to arbitrate. This is relevant to understanding how arbitration is approached in Florida, including under the DBPR.
LEN-CG South, LLC v. Champions Club Condominium Association, Inc., 336 So.3d 1245 (Fla. App. 2022)
Florida District Court of Appeals
Extract
LEN-CG South, LLC and Lennar Homes, LLC (collectively, 'Appellants') appeal the trial court's nonfinal order denying Appellants' motion to compel arbitration
against Champions Club Condominium Association, Inc. ('the Association'). We have jurisdiction. See Fla. R. App. P. 9.130(a)(3)(C)(iv). Because the Declaration
of Condominium ('the Declaration') compelled arbitration between the parties, we reverse. ... Appellants sought to compel the Association to arbitrate the lawsuit,
alleging valid arbitration provisions existed in four documents: 1) the Declaration; 2) the purchase and sale agreements of the individual unit owners; 3) the units'
limited warranties; and 4) the units' special warranty deeds. ... We review de novo the interpretation of an arbitration provision and a condominium declaration.
See 4927 Voorhees Rd., LLC v. Tesoriero, 291 So. 3d 668, 670 (Fla. 2d DCA 2020) ; Courvoisier Cts., LLC v. Courvoisier Cts. Condo. Ass'n, 105 So. 3d 579,
580 (Fla. 3d DCA 2012). A trial court must grant a motion to compel arbitration if it determines: 1) a valid agreement to arbitrate exists; 2) an arbitrable issue
exists; and 3) the right to arbitration has not been waived. See Seifert v. U.S. Home Corp., 750 So. 2d 633, 636 (Fla. 1999).
Summary
The passage discusses a case where the Florida District Court of Appeals reversed a trial court's decision, compelling arbitration based on the Declaration of
Condominium and other related documents. It outlines the criteria for compelling arbitration: a valid agreement, an arbitrable issue, and no waiver of the right to
arbitration. This is relevant to understanding how arbitration clauses are enforced in Florida, particularly in the context of condominium associations, which may
fall under the purview of the Florida DBPR.

Angels Senior Living at Connerton Court, LLC v. Gundry, 210 So.3d 257 (Fla. App. 2017)
Florida District Court of Appeals
Extract
Connerton argues that the trial court lacked authority to determine whether the arbitration agreement was valid; the delegation clause, it tells us, vested that
power in the arbitrator. See Rent–A–Center, W., Inc. v. Jackson, 561 U.S. 63, 74, 130 S.Ct. 2772, 177 L.Ed.2d 403 (2010). Generally, when an '[arbitration]
[a]greement contains a delegation provision, we only retain jurisdiction to review a challenge to that particular provision. Absent a direct challenge, we must treat
the delegation provision as valid and allow the arbitrator to determine the issue of arbitrability.' Parnell v. CashCall, Inc., 804 F.3d 1142, 1148 (11th Cir. 2015)
(citing Rent–A–Center, 561 U.S. at 72, 130 S.Ct. 2772 ).
Summary

Avid Engineering, Inc. v. Orlando Marketplace Ltd., 809 So.2d 1 (Fla. App. 2001)
Florida District Court of Appeals
Extract
In Seifert v. U.S. Home Corp., 750 So.2d 633, 636 (Fla.1999), the Florida Supreme Court stated: Under both federal statutory provisions and Florida's arbitration
code, there are three elements for courts to consider in ruling on a motion to compel arbitration of a given dispute: (1) whether a valid written agreement to
arbitrate exists; (2) whether an arbitrable issue exists; and (3) whether the right to arbitration was waived. See Terminix Int'l Co. L.P. v. Ponzio, 693 So.2d 104,
106 (Fla. 5th DCA 1997).
Summary
Clear framework for understanding how courts in Florida approach motions to compel arbitration. It outlines three critical elements that must be considered: the
existence of a valid written agreement to arbitrate, the presence of an arbitrable issue, and whether the right to arbitration has been waived. This framework is
applicable to arbitration cases under the Florida Arbitration Code, which would include cases related to the Florida Department of Business and Professional
Regulation (DBPR) if they involve arbitration.
Neate v. Cypress Club Condominium, Inc., 718 So.2d 390 (Fla. App. 1998)
Florida District Court of Appeals
Extract
The rewritten statute newly required that disputes between a unit owner and condominium association involving the authority of the board to require or forbid unit
owners to take action must first be submitted to nonbinding arbitration before a lawsuit may be filed. Section 718.1255(4)(a) states in part that: '[p]rior to the
institution of court litigation, a party to a dispute shall [e.s.] petition the division for nonbinding arbitration.' Equally important, it provides that the decision of the
arbitrators is final unless a party to the dispute files a complaint for a trial de novo within 30 days after the arbitration decision has been presented in writing.
Summary
The statute requires disputes between unit owners and condominium associations to be submitted to nonbinding arbitration before any court litigation can be
initiated. This requirement is part of Section 718.1255(4)(a) of the Florida Statutes. The arbitration decision is considered final unless a party files for a trial de
novo within 30 days of the written arbitration decision. This process is intended to streamline dispute resolution and reduce litigation costs.
Florida Power Corp. v. City of Casselberry, 793 So.2d 1174 (Fla. App. 2001)
Florida District Court of Appeals
Extract
Arbitration provisions are generally favored by the courts; however, because arbitration provisions are contractual in nature, construction of such provisions and 
the contracts in which they appear remains a matter of contract interpretation. See Seifert v. U.S. Home Corp., 750 So.2d 633, 636 (Fla.1999) (citations omitted); 
see also R.W. Roberts Constr. Co., Inc. v. St. Johns River Water Management Dist. for Use and Ben. of McDonald Elec., 423 So.2d 630, 632 (Fla. 5th DCA 
1982). Accordingly, the determination of whether an arbitration clause requires arbitration of a particular dispute necessarily 'rests on the intent of the parties.' Id.; 
see also Regency Group, Inc. v. McDaniels, 647 So.2d 192, 193 (Fla. 1st DCA 1994). 'The general rule is that where an arbitration agreement exists between the 
parties, arbitration is required only of those controversies or disputes which the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration.' Miller v. Roberts, 682 So.2d 691, 692

(Fla. 5th DCA 1996). Under both federal statutory provisions and Florida's Arbitration Code, there are three elements for courts to consider in ruling on a motion
to compel arbitration of a given dispute: (1) whether a valid written agreement to arbitrate exists; (2) whether an arbitrable issue exists; and (3) whether the right
to arbitration was waived. See Seifert, 750 So.2d at 636; Terminix Int'l Co., L.P. v. Ponzio, 693 So.2d 104, 106 (Fla. 5th DCA 1997).
Summary
The passage provides insight into how arbitration clauses are interpreted under Florida law, emphasizing that they are contractual in nature and depend on the
intent of the parties involved. It outlines the general rule that arbitration is required only for disputes the parties have agreed to arbitrate. It also specifies the three
elements considered by courts when ruling on motions to compel arbitration: the existence of a valid agreement, the presence of an arbitrable issue, and whether
the right to arbitration was waived. This information is relevant to understanding arbitration under the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation
(DBPR) as it provides a legal framework for arbitration agreements in Florida.
Manorcare Health Services, Inc. v. Stiehl, 22 So.3d 96 (Fla. App. 2009)
Extract
In challenging the validity of an arbitration agreement, a party must assert defenses applicable to all contracts—defenses such as fraud, duress, or
unconscionability. Global Travel Mktg., Inc. v. Shea, 908 So.2d 392, 397 (Fla.2005); see also Gainesville Health Care Ctr., Inc. v. Weston, 857 So.2d 278, 283
(Fla. 1st DCA 2003) (observing that both the Federal Arbitration Act and the Florida Arbitration Code permit a challenge to the validity of an arbitration provision
based upon state-law contract defenses). A trial court is to review those defenses which go to the validity of the arbitration agreement itself, rather than to the
enforceability of the contract as a whole.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the legal framework for challenging arbitration agreements in Florida, highlighting that defenses such as fraud, duress, or
unconscionability can be used to contest the validity of such agreements. This is relevant to understanding how arbitration agreements are treated under Florida
law, which is pertinent to the question about arbitration under the Florida DBPR.
Mills v. Robert W. Gottfried, Inc., 272 So.2d 837 (Fla. App. 1973)
Florida District Court of Appeals
Extract
'All claims, disputes and other matters in question arising out of, or relating to, this Contract or the breach thereof,. .. shall be decided by arbitration in accordance
with the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then obtaining unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.. . .' These
provisions for arbitration are not contrary to the public policy of this state (see Section 682.02, F.S.1971, F.S.A.) and should be enforced in accordance with the
Florida Arbitration Code, Chapter 682, F.S.1971, F.S.A. However, both the agreement and the Florida Arbitration Code contemplate the submission to arbitration
of real Controversies--not questions simply of academic interest. When the motion to dismiss was filed in the present case, there was no controversy to submit to
arbitration. As noted above, the defendants' answer had not been filed. Hence, all the trial judge had before him was an uncontroverted claim for the payment of a
sum certain and a demand for a lien to enforce the payment. The trial judge, therefore, did not err in denying the defendants' alternative motion for arbitration.
Summary
The case discusses the enforceability of arbitration agreements under the Florida Arbitration Code. The court affirmed that arbitration provisions are not contrary
to public policy and should be enforced according to the Florida Arbitration Code. However, the court also noted that arbitration is intended for real controversies,
not merely academic questions. In this case, the court found no controversy to arbitrate, as the defendants had not filed an answer, leading to the denial of the
motion for arbitration.
ROYAL PROFESSIONAL BUILDERS, INC. v. Roggin, 853 So.2d 520 (Fla. App. 2003)
Florida District Court of Appeals
Extract
In ruling on a motion to compel arbitration, a trial court must decide three issues: (1) whether a valid written agreement exists containing an arbitration clause; (2)
whether an arbitrable issue exists; and (3) whether the right to arbitration was waived. See Pulte Home Corp. v. Smith, 823 So.2d 305, 308-09 (Fla. 2d DCA
2002)(citing Seifert v. U.S. Home Corp., 750 So.2d 633, 636 (Fla. 1999)). Because arbitration provisions are contractual in nature, construction of such provisions
and the contracts in which they appear remains a matter of contract interpretation. See Seifert, 750 So.2d at 636. The general rule is that where an arbitration
agreement exists between the parties, arbitration is required only of those controversies or disputes which the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration. See
Fla. Power Corp. v. City of Casselberry, 793 So.2d 1174 (Fla. 5th DCA 2001). Because the arbitration provision in the agreement did not provide for the
arbitration panel to decide whether the claim is arbitrable, the trial court, rather than the arbitration panel, should make that determination. See Premier Med.
Mgmt., Ltd. v. Salas, 830 So.2d 959, 960 n. 2 (Fla. 1st DCA 2002).

Criteria that a trial court must consider when ruling on a motion to compel arbitration, which includes determining the existence of a valid arbitration agreement,
the presence of an arbitrable issue, and whether the right to arbitration has been waived. It also emphasizes that arbitration provisions are subject to contract
interpretation and that only disputes agreed upon by the parties are subject to arbitration. Additionally, it clarifies that the trial court, not the arbitration panel,
should decide the arbitrability of a claim unless the agreement specifies otherwise. This information is relevant to understanding how arbitration is approached
under Florida law, which is pertinent to the operations of the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR) when arbitration is involved.
Larry Kent Homes, Inc. v. Empire of America FSA, 474 So.2d 868, 10 Fla. L. Weekly 1969 (Fla. App. 1985)
Florida District Court of Appeals
Extract
As Larry Kent correctly points out, arbitration agreements are valid and enforceable and public policy favors arbitration as an alternative to litigation. Midwest Mut.
Ins. Co. v. Santiesteban, 287 So.2d 665 (Fla.1973). Arbitration clauses have been enforced in cases similar to the present one. See, e.g., Walter L. Keller &
Assoc. v. Health Management Foundation, 438 So.2d 1076 (Fla. 2d DCA 1983); Post Tensioned Engineering v. Fairways Plaza, 412 So.2d 871 (Fla. 3d DCA
1982).
Summary
Arbitration agreements are considered valid and enforceable in Florida, and there is a public policy that favors arbitration as an alternative to litigation. This is
supported by references to other cases where arbitration clauses have been enforced. The context of the passage is a legal case from the Florida District Court of
Appeals, which provides a precedent for the enforceability of arbitration agreements. The scope is broad as it applies to arbitration agreements in general, not
limited to a specific type of case or industry.
Beverly Hills Development Corp. v. George Wimpey of Florida, Inc., 661 So.2d 969 (Fla. App. 1995)
Florida District Court of Appeals
Extract
We start our analysis by noting that Florida law favors arbitration over litigation to resolve private disputes. North American Van Lines v. Collyer, 616 So.2d 177,
178 (Fla. 5th DCA 1993). There is a strong public policy favoring arbitration. Lapidus v. Arlen Beach Condominium Ass'n., Inc., 394 So.2d 1102 (Fla. 3d DCA
1981). All questions concerning the scope or waiver of the right to arbitrate under contracts should be resolved in favor of arbitration rather than against it.
Ronbeck Construction Co., Inc. v. Savanna Club Corp., 592 So.2d 344 (Fla. 4th DCA 1992).
Summary
The passage highlights the general legal principle in Florida that favors arbitration as a means to resolve disputes, which is relevant to understanding the broader
legal context in which the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR) operates. The passage does not specifically mention the DBPR
but provides insight into the legal environment regarding arbitration in Florida.
Sterling Condominium Ass'n, Inc. v. Herrera, 690 So.2d 703 (Fla. App. 1997)
Florida District Court of Appeals
Extract
Section 718.1255(4)(a) requires that '[p]rior to the institution of court litigation, the [condominium association and the unit owner] shall petition the division for
nonbinding arbitration.' Herrera argues that, based on this requirement for mandatory nonbinding arbitration of disputes, the circuit court lacked subject matter
jurisdiction. We disagree for several reasons. First, section 718.1255(3), recites the following 'Legislative Findings:' (a) ... that unit owners are frequently at a
disadvantage when litigating against an association. Specifically, a condominium association, with its statutory assessment authority, is often more able to bear
the costs and expenses of litigation than the unit owner who must rely on his own financial resources to satisfy the costs of litigation against the association. (b) ...
that the courts are becoming overcrowded with condominium and other disputes, and ... that alternative dispute resolution has been making progress in reducing
court dockets and trials and in offering a more efficient, cost-effective option to court litigation.... (c) [that] [t]here exists a need to develop a means of alternative
dispute resolution. (d) [that] [t]he high cost and significant delay of circuit court litigation faced by unit owners in the state can be alleviated by requiring nonbinding
arbitration, thereby reducing delay and attorney's fees while preserving the right of either party to have its case heard by a jury, if applicable, in a court of law. ...
Secondly, because the arbitration is 'nonbinding' and because the statute explains that 'nothing in this provision shall be construed to foreclose parties from
proceeding in a trial de novo,' § 718.1255(4), Florida Statutes, we find that the statute is not jurisdictional and that, therefore, the circuit court did not lack subject
matter jurisdiction to hear this dispute.
Summary
Florida law requires condominium associations and unit owners to engage in nonbinding arbitration before proceeding to court litigation. This requirement is
intended to alleviate the disadvantages faced by unit owners, reduce court congestion, and provide a cost-effective alternative to litigation. However, because the
arbitration is nonbinding, it does not preclude parties from seeking a trial de novo in court, and thus, it does not affect the court's subject matter jurisdiction.

Benedict v. Pensacola Motor Sales, Inc., 846 So.2d 1238 (Fla. App. 2003)
Florida District Court of Appeals
Extract
Arbitration clauses are to be given the 'broadest possible interpretation to accomplish the salutory purpose of resolving controversies out of court.' Royal
Caribbean Cruises, Ltd. v. Universal Employment Agency, 664 So.2d 1107, 1108 (Fla. 3d DCA 1996). When parties contractually agree to arbitrate, a court must
give effect to that agreement, and all arbitrable issues must be resolved through arbitration unless arbitration has been waived. All questions regarding waiver of
arbitration should be construed in favor of arbitration. See Zager Plumbing, Inc. v. JPI Nat'l Constr., Inc., 785 So.2d 660, 662 (Fla. 3d DCA 2001).
Summary
Interpretation of arbitration clauses in contracts, emphasizing that they should be given the broadest possible interpretation to resolve disputes out of court. It also
highlights that courts must enforce arbitration agreements unless there is a waiver, and any questions about waiver should favor arbitration. This is relevant to
understanding how arbitration is approached in Florida, including under the DBPR, as it provides a general legal framework for arbitration agreements.
Jackson v. Shakespeare Found., Inc., 108 So. 3d 587 (Fla. 2013)
Florida Supreme Court
Extract
Generally, the three fundamental elements that must be considered when determining whether a dispute is required to proceed to arbitration are: (1) whether a
valid written agreement to arbitrate exists; (2) whether an arbitrable issue exists; and (3) whether the right to arbitration was waived. See Seifert v. U.S. Home
Corp., 750 So.2d 633, 636 (Fla.1999). Arbitration provisions are contractual in nature and remain a matter of contractual interpretation. See id. The intent of the
parties to a contract, as manifested in the plain language of the arbitration provision and contract itself, determines whether a dispute is subject to arbitration. See
id. Courts generally favor such provisions, and will try to resolve an ambiguity in an arbitration provision in favor of arbitration. See id.; see also Qubty v. Nagda,
817 So.2d 952, 956 (Fla. 5th DCA 2002).
Summary
General framework for arbitration in Florida, which is relevant to understanding arbitration under the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation

Shotts v. OP Winter Haven, Inc., 86 So. 3d 456 (Fla. 2012)
Florida Supreme Court
Extract
In Florida, an arbitration clause in a contract involving interstate commerce is subject to the Florida Arbitration Code (FAC), to the extent the FAC is not in conflict
with the FAA. This Court in Seifert v. U.S. Home Corp., 750 So.2d 633 (Fla.1999), held that, in a hearing on a motion to compel arbitration, the inquiry follows the
same three-step process regardless whether the inquiry is conducted under the FAC or the FAA: Under both federal statutory provisions and Florida's arbitration
code, there are three elements for courts to consider in ruling on a motion to compel arbitration of a given dispute: (1) whether a valid written agreement to
arbitrate exists; (2) whether an arbitrable issue exists; and (3) whether the right to arbitration was waived. Seifert, 750 So.2d at 636.
Summary
The passage provides insight into how arbitration clauses are treated under Florida law, specifically in the context of contracts involving interstate commerce. It
outlines the three-step process used by courts to determine whether arbitration should be compelled, which is relevant to understanding arbitration under the
Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR) as it relates to the broader legal framework governing arbitration in Florida.

Extract
Before accepting appointment, an individual who is requested to serve as an arbitrator, after making a reasonable inquiry, shall disclose to all parties to the 
agreement to arbitrate and arbitration proceeding and to any other arbitrators any known facts that a reasonable person would consider likely to affect the

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
existing or past relationship with any of the parties to the agreement to arbitrate or the arbitration proceeding, their counsel or representative, a witness, or
another arbitrator. An arbitrator has a continuing obligation to disclose to all parties to the agreement to arbitrate and arbitration proceeding and to any other
arbitrators any facts that the arbitrator learns after accepting appointment that a reasonable person would consider likely to affect the impartiality of the arbitrator.
If an arbitrator discloses a fact required by subsection or subsection to be disclosed and a party timely objects to the appointment or continued service of the
arbitrator based upon the fact disclosed, the objection may be a ground under s. 682.13(b) for vacating an award made by the arbitrator. If the arbitrator did not
disclose a fact as required by subsection or subsection, upon timely objection by a party, the court may vacate an award under s. 682.13(b). An arbitrator
appointed as a neutral arbitrator who does not disclose a known, direct, and material interest in the outcome of the arbitration proceeding or a known, existing,
and substantial relationship with a party is presumed to act with evident partiality under s. 682.13(b). If the parties to an arbitration proceeding agree to the
procedures of an arbitration organization or any other procedures for challenges to arbitrators before an award is made, substantial compliance with those
procedures is a condition precedent to a motion to vacate an award on that ground under s. 682.13(b).
Summary
Disclosure obligations of arbitrators in Florida, which are crucial for maintaining impartiality in arbitration proceedings. It specifies that arbitrators must disclose
any financial or personal interests and any relationships with parties involved in the arbitration. Failure to disclose such information can lead to the vacating of an
arbitration award under s. 682.13(b). This is generally applicable to all arbitration proceedings under the Florida Arbitration Code, making it relevant to
understanding the caselaw related to arbitration under the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR).

Extract
An arbitrator or an arbitration organization acting in that capacity is immune from civil liability to the same extent as a judge of a court of this state acting in a
judicial capacity. The immunity afforded under this section supplements any immunity under other law. The failure of an arbitrator to make a disclosure required
by s. 682.041 does not cause any loss of immunity under this section. In a judicial, administrative, or similar proceeding, an arbitrator or representative of an
arbitration organization is not competent to testify, and may not be required to produce records as to any statement, conduct, decision, or ruling occurring during
the arbitration proceeding, to the same extent as a judge of a court of this state acting in a judicial capacity. This subsection does not apply: (a) To the extent
necessary to determine the claim of an arbitrator, arbitration organization, or representative of the arbitration organization against a party to the arbitration
proceeding; or (b) To a hearing on a motion to vacate an award under s. 682.13(a) or (b) if the movant establishes prima facie that a ground for vacating the
award exists. If a person commences a civil action against an arbitrator, arbitration organization, or representative of an arbitration organization arising from the
services of the arbitrator, organization, or representative or if a person seeks to compel an arbitrator or a representative of an arbitration organization to testify or
produce records in violation of subsection , and the court decides that the arbitrator, arbitration organization, or representative of an arbitration organization is
immune from civil liability or that the arbitrator or representative of the organization is not competent to testify, the court shall award to the arbitrator, organization,
or representative reasonable attorney fees and other reasonable expenses of litigation.
Summary
The statute provides immunity to arbitrators and arbitration organizations from civil liability, similar to the immunity judges have. It also outlines the conditions
under which arbitrators are not competent to testify about arbitration proceedings. This is relevant to understanding the legal protections and limitations on
arbitrators within the context of arbitration under the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation.
Fla. Stat. § 682.13 Fla. Stat. § 682.13 Vacating an Award

prejudicing the rights of a party to the arbitration proceeding; (c) An arbitrator refused to postpone the hearing upon showing of sufficient cause for postponement,
refused to hear evidence material to the controversy, or otherwise conducted the hearing contrary to s. 682.06, so as to prejudice substantially the rights of a
party to the arbitration proceeding; (d) An arbitrator exceeded the arbitrator's powers; (e) There was no agreement to arbitrate, unless the person participated in
the arbitration proceeding without raising the objection under s. 682.06 not later than the beginning of the arbitration hearing; or (f) The arbitration was conducted
without proper notice of the initiation of an arbitration as required in s. 682.032 so as to prejudice substantially the rights of a party to the arbitration proceeding.

Fla. Stat. § 682.031 Fla. Stat. § 682.031 Provisional Remedies
Extract
Before an arbitrator is appointed and is authorized and able to act, the court, upon motion of a party to an arbitration proceeding and for good cause shown, may
enter an order for provisional remedies to protect the effectiveness of the arbitration proceeding to the same extent and under the same conditions as if the
controversy were the subject of a civil action. After an arbitrator is appointed and is authorized and able to act: (a) The arbitrator may issue such orders for
provisional remedies, including interim awards, as the arbitrator finds necessary to protect the effectiveness of the arbitration proceeding and to promote the fair
and expeditious resolution of the controversy, to the same extent and under the same conditions as if the controversy were the subject of a civil action. (b) A party
to an arbitration proceeding may move the court for a provisional remedy only if the matter is urgent and the arbitrator is not able to act timely or the arbitrator
cannot provide an adequate remedy. A party does not waive a right of arbitration by making a motion under this section. If an arbitrator awards a provisional
remedy for injunctive or equitable relief, the arbitrator shall state in the award the factual findings and legal basis for the award. A party may seek to confirm or
vacate a provisional remedy award for injunctive or equitable relief under s. 682.081.
Summary
The passage provides guidance on the availability and process for obtaining provisional remedies in arbitration proceedings under the Florida Arbitration Code. It
outlines the roles of both the court and the arbitrator in issuing such remedies, ensuring the effectiveness of the arbitration process. This is relevant to

The impact of unlicensed contractor activities.
Florida Bar Journal - Florida Bar - Dudley, Frederick R. - 2007-12-01
Extract
Lastly, this section has been applied to cases involving arbitration clauses. While there are numerous conflicting cases (16) declaring whether it is for the courts
or the arbitrators to determine the 'validity' of a contract containing an arbitration clause, all of them appear to have been resolved by Buckeye Check Cashing,
Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U.S. 440 (2006). In Buckeye, the Court overturned the Florida Supreme Court's decision (17) and held that 1) the arbitration provision is
'severable' from the remainder of the contract; and 2) a claim that the contract was void by reason of usury had to be determined by the arbitrators, not the court,
in the absence of an attack on the arbitration clause itself (such as, the portion of the contract that was procured by fraud in the inducement).
Summary
Application of arbitration clauses in contracts, specifically referencing the Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna case, which is a significant decision in
arbitration law. This case established that arbitration provisions are severable from the rest of the contract, meaning that issues of contract validity are to be
determined by arbitrators unless the arbitration clause itself is challenged. This principle is applicable to contracts under the jurisdiction of the Florida Department
of Business and Professional Regulation, particularly in the construction industry.
The Florida homeowners construction recovery fund: how to collect from an uncollectible contractor.
Florida Bar Journal - Florida Bar - Perera, Diane S. - 2017-01-01

=== PAGE 23 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
The Fund's legislative purpose is to 'compensate an aggrieved claimant who contracted for the construction or improvement of the homeowner's residence
located within this state and who has obtained a final judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction, was awarded restitution by the Florida Construction Industry
Licensing Board (CILB), or received an award in arbitration against a licensee based on specified acts.'
Summary
The Florida Homeowners' Construction Recovery Fund can compensate claimants who have received an arbitration award against a licensed contractor. This
suggests that arbitration is a recognized method for resolving disputes under the DBPR, and awards from such arbitrations can lead to compensation from the
Fund.
Legal Challenges to Arbitration Awards.
Florida Bar Journal - Florida Bar - Spero, Donald J. - 2019-05-01
Extract
Application of FAA Standards to Awards Decided in Arbitrations Governed by F.S. [section]682.13, et seq.--The FAC is modeled after the Florida Arbitration Act
(FAA). It follows that decisions in cases challenging the validity of arbitration awards where the FAA governs should apply the same interpretive principals as
those applied by courts in similar cases governed by the FAA. When both or either statute may be applicable, the FAC is limited by the provisions of the FAA. As
the Florida Supreme Court stated in Shotts v. OP Winter Haven, Inc., 86 So. 3d 456, 463-64 (Fla. 2011), 'In Florida, an arbitration clause in a contract involving
interstate commerce is subject to the Florida Arbitration Code to the extent the FAC is not in conflict with the FAA.'
Summary
Application of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) standards to arbitration awards governed by the Florida Arbitration Code (FAC). It highlights that the FAC is
modeled after the FAA, and when both statutes may apply, the FAC is limited by the FAA's provisions. The Florida Supreme Court's decision in Shotts v. OP
Winter Haven, Inc. is cited to illustrate that arbitration clauses in contracts involving interstate commerce are subject to the FAC as long as it does not conflict with
the FAA. This information is relevant to understanding how arbitration awards are challenged and reviewed in Florida, which is pertinent to the question about
arbitration under the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR).

Florida's High Court Clarifies That Incorporating AAA Rules Into An Arbitration Provision Delegates Arbitrability To Arbitrator
Extract
The Florida Supreme Court took up the case to correct this 'outlier.' The general rule is that a court decides arbitrability unless the arbitration provision at issue
contains 'clear and unmistakable' evidence of the parties' intent to delegate the issue of arbitrability to the arbitrator. Applying this rule, the Florida Supreme Court
held that the arbitration provision's integration of the AAA Rules constituted 'clear and unmistakable' evidence that the parties intended for an arbitrator to decide
arbitrability. ... In sum, the Florida Supreme Court's decision in Airbnb brings clarity to lower courts in Florida when faced with a previously well-settled
issue-under the FAA, when an arbitration provision integrates the AAA Rules, the issue of arbitrability is delegated to the arbitrator. Airbnb thus reminds parties
entering agreements containing arbitration provisions to check whether their arbitration provision integrates the AAA Rules and to understand the ramifications of
this integration.
Summary

=== PAGE 24 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The passage provides insight into a Florida Supreme Court decision clarifying that when an arbitration provision incorporates the AAA Rules, it constitutes clear
evidence that the parties intended for an arbitrator to decide on arbitrability. This decision is applicable to arbitration cases in Florida, including those under the
Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR), as it sets a precedent for how arbitrability is determined when AAA Rules are integrated.
Who Decides If A Dispute Is Subject To Arbitration?
Extract
The Florida Supreme Court on March 31, 2022, found that the incorporation by reference of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) arbitration rules in
Airbnb's Terms of Service constitutes clear and unmistakable evidence of the parties' intent to delegate questions of arbitrability away from the court and to the
arbitrator.
Summary
The passage provides insight into how the Florida Supreme Court views the incorporation of arbitration rules, specifically the AAA rules, as clear evidence of the
parties' intent to delegate arbitrability questions to arbitrators. This is relevant to understanding arbitration under the Florida Department of Business and
Professional Regulation (DBPR) as it highlights a significant legal precedent regarding arbitration agreements in Florida.
Court Holds Contractors Must Provide Sufficient Proof To Compel Association Claims To Arbitration
Extract
Arbitration provisions are becoming more common in construction contracts, but a recent court decision reveals that enforcing these provisions requires more
than just placing them in a contract. Contractors, especially those seeking to arbitrate claims involving multiple property owners or an entire homeowner or
condominium association, must sufficiently establish that enough of the property owners agreed to arbitrate their claims.
Summary
A recent court decision has clarified the requirements for enforcing arbitration provisions in construction contracts. Specifically, it highlights the necessity for
contractors to provide sufficient proof that a significant number of property owners have agreed to arbitration, especially in cases involving homeowner or
condominium associations. This suggests that simply including an arbitration clause in a contract is not enough; there must be demonstrable agreement from the
involved parties.
