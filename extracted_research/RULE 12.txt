Question
Pleadings have been filed on Petitioner’s behalf by an attorney (Roderick D.
Marx) who is not named as counsel of record, while the authority of the
purported attorney of record (Cooper L. Carter) has been under challenge
and remains unaddressed. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12 requires
attorneys to show authority to act in a case when challenged. Failure to do
so may result in the striking of pleadings and other sanctions. The continued
filing of critical pleadings by an attorney lacking proper appearance, and the
failure to address a Rule 12 challenge, demonstrates a disregard for
procedural rules and the orderly administration of justice, further
compounding the egregiousness of Petitioner’s and her counsel’s conduct.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12, when an attorney’s authority to act
is challenged and remains unaddressed, the court must refuse to permit that
attorney’s appearance and strike pleadings if no authorized counsel
appears; continued filings by an attorney lacking proper authority or
appearance violate procedural rules and may result in sanctions. The
described conduct reflects a disregard for the orderly administration of
justice and exposes the pleadings to being struck under established Texas
law.
Summary
Texas law, as codified in Rule 12 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and
consistently interpreted by Texas appellate courts, provides a clear
mechanism for challenging an attorney’s authority to act in a case. When
such a challenge is made by sworn motion and remains unresolved, the
burden is on the challenged attorney to prove authority; failure to do so
requires the court to refuse the attorney’s appearance and strike pleadings
if no authorized representative appears.
Filing pleadings by an attorney who is not counsel of record, while the
authority of the purported attorney of record is under unresolved challenge,
contravenes these procedural safeguards. This conduct not only risks the
striking of pleadings and other sanctions but also demonstrates a disregard
for the procedural rules designed to ensure the integrity and orderly
administration of justice in Texas courts.

Background and Relevant Law
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12
The central legislative authority is Rule 12 of the Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure, which governs challenges to an attorney’s authority to act in a
case. Rule 12 provides that any party may, by sworn written motion,
challenge the authority of an attorney prosecuting or defending a suit. Upon
such a challenge, the attorney must be cited to appear before the court and
show authority to act. The burden of proof is on the challenged attorney. If
the attorney fails to show sufficient authority, the court is required to refuse
to permit the attorney to appear and must strike the pleadings if no
authorized person appears to prosecute or defend the case, as set out in 
Rule 12. Attorney to Show Authority, Tex. R. Civ. P. 12.
Case Law Interpreting Rule 12
Texas appellate and Supreme Court decisions have repeatedly affirmed the
mandatory nature of Rule 12’s procedures and remedies:
The Texas Supreme Court in Angelina County v. McFarland, 374 S.W.2d
417 (Tex. 1964) explained that Rule 12 is the exclusive method for
challenging an attorney’s authority, places the burden on the
challenged attorney, and requires the court to refuse the appearance
and dismiss the case if no authorized person appears.
In re Murrin Bros. 1885, Ltd., 603 S.W.3d 53 (Tex. 2019) reaffirmed
that, upon a Rule 12 challenge, the attorney must show authority, and
failure to do so mandates refusal of appearance and striking of
pleadings.
Numerous appellate cases, including Ellis v. Courtney Prince; LVTRise,
Inc., 02-25-00162-CV (Tex. App. Aug 14, 2025), Catt v. Middleton, 698
S.W.3d 66, Choudhri v. Abdullatif, 14-23-00679-CV, 14-23-00680-CV
(Tex. App. Aug 07, 2025), and Benit v. Primalend Capital Partners, LP,
05-21-00024-CV (Tex. App. May 06, 2022), have consistently held that
the court must enforce these requirements and that continued filings by
an attorney lacking proper authority or appearance are procedurally
improper.
These authorities collectively establish that the orderly administration of
justice requires strict adherence to Rule 12’s procedures, and that disregard
for these rules can result in severe consequences, including the striking of
pleadings and other sanctions.
Analysis
1. The Rule 12 Challenge: Mechanism and Burden
Rule 12 is designed to protect parties from unauthorized litigation and to
ensure that only attorneys with actual authority prosecute or defend cases.
When a party files a sworn motion under Rule 12, the challenged attorney
must appear before the court and demonstrate authority to act on behalf of
•

•

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the client. The burden of proof is squarely on the challenged attorney, as
confirmed in Benit v. Primalend Capital Partners, LP, 05-21-00024-CV (Tex.
App. May 06, 2022) and Wheelock v. Kerr Cnty., 04-22-00349-CV (Tex. App.
Feb 22, 2023).
The presumption that an attorney acts with authority is rebuttable, and once
challenged, the attorney must provide evidence—typically an affidavit or
testimony from the client—demonstrating that the attorney was retained to
provide representation (Nolana Open MRI Ctr., Inc. v. Pechero, NUMBER
13-13-00552-CV (Tex. App. Feb 12, 2015)). If the attorney fails to meet this
burden, the court is required to refuse to permit the attorney to appear and
must strike the pleadings if no authorized person appears (Rule 12. Attorney
to Show Authority, Tex. R. Civ. P. 12; In re Murrin Bros. 1885, Ltd., 603 S.W.
3d 53 (Tex. 2019)).
2. Consequences of Failing to Address a Rule 12 Challenge
The consequences of failing to address a Rule 12 challenge are mandatory
and severe. If the challenged attorney does not appear or fails to show
authority, the court must refuse to permit the attorney’s appearance and
strike the pleadings if no authorized substitute appears (Plant v. Cleveland
Reg'l Med. Ctr. (In re Gravitt), 371 S.W.3d 465 (Tex. App. 2012); Phillips v.
Phillips, 244 S.W.3d 433 (Tex. App. 2007)). This is not a discretionary
remedy; the rule’s language and the case law interpreting it make clear that
the court is required to take these steps.
The Texas Supreme Court in Angelina County v. McFarland, 374 S.W.2d 417
(Tex. 1964) emphasized that Rule 12 was intended to discourage and dismiss
suits brought without authority, protecting parties from groundless
litigation. The court in Ellis v. Courtney Prince; LVTRise, Inc., 02-25-00162-
CV (Tex. App. Aug 14, 2025) further confirmed that continued filings by an
unauthorized attorney after a Rule 12 challenge and court order striking
pleadings constitute unauthorized practice and justify the court’s refusal to
permit further participation.
3. Filing by Non-Record Attorneys and Unresolved Authority
The scenario described—where pleadings are filed by an attorney (Roderick
D. Marx) who is not counsel of record, while the authority of the purported
attorney of record (Cooper L. Carter) is under unresolved challenge—falls
squarely within the concerns addressed by Rule 12 and the case law. Texas
courts recognize that an attorney may appear of record without actual
authority, and Rule 12 exists to address precisely this situation (In re Users
Systems Serv., 22 S.W.3d 331 (Tex. 1999)).
If the authority of the attorney of record is challenged and remains
unaddressed, and another attorney who is not counsel of record files
pleadings, those filings are procedurally improper. The court is required to
refuse to permit the appearance of any attorney who has not demonstrated
authority and to strike pleadings if no authorized counsel appears (Catt v.
Middleton, 698 S.W.3d 66; Choudhri v. Abdullatif, 14-23-00679-CV,
14-23-00680-CV (Tex. App. Aug 07, 2025)).

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The exclusive method for challenging an attorney’s authority is through Rule
12, and the court must resolve such challenges before allowing further
participation by any attorney whose authority is in question (Fulcher v.
Texas State Bd. of Public Accountancy, 571 S.W.2d 366 (Tex. Ct. App. 1978); 
Tanner v. Black, 464 S.W.3d 23 (Tex. App. 2015)). Failure to do so
undermines the integrity of the proceedings and the rights of the parties.
4. Disregard for Procedural Rules and the Administration of Justice
The continued filing of critical pleadings by an attorney lacking proper
appearance, while a Rule 12 challenge to the authority of the attorney of
record remains unresolved, is not merely a technical violation. Texas courts
have repeatedly emphasized that such conduct demonstrates a disregard for
the procedural rules that safeguard the orderly administration of justice
(Ellis v. Courtney Prince; LVTRise, Inc., 02-25-00162-CV (Tex. App. Aug 14,
2025); Plant ex rel. Gravitt v. Cleveland Reg'l Med. Ctr. (In re Gravitt), NO.
14-11-00075-CV, NO. 14-11-00526-CV (Tex. App. May 15, 2012)).
The purpose of Rule 12 is to ensure that only those with actual authority
prosecute or defend cases, and to protect parties from groundless or
unauthorized litigation (Angelina County v. McFarland, 374 S.W.2d 417 (Tex.
1964)). When attorneys ignore or fail to resolve Rule 12 challenges, they
undermine these fundamental protections and expose their clients to the
risk of having their pleadings struck and their claims or defenses dismissed.
Exceptions and Caveats
While Rule 12 is the exclusive method for challenging an attorney’s
authority, and its procedures are mandatory, there are procedural
requirements that must be met for a Rule 12 challenge to be effective. The
motion must be sworn and served on the challenged attorney at least ten
days before the hearing (Benit v. Primalend Capital Partners, LP,
05-21-00024-CV (Tex. App. May 06, 2022)). However, courts have sometimes
excused technical defects in the motion if the substance of the challenge is
clear and no timely objection is made (Sloan v. Rivers, 693 S.W.2d 782 (Tex.
App. 1985)).
Additionally, if a party fails to raise a Rule 12 challenge before trial, the right
to challenge may be waived (Pratt v. State, 13-22-00030-CV (Tex. App. Apr
27, 2023)). However, in the scenario described, the challenge has been
made and remains unaddressed, so these exceptions do not apply.
It is also important to note that the court’s obligation to strike pleadings and
refuse appearance applies only if the challenged attorney fails to show
authority and no other authorized person appears. If a new attorney with
proper authority appears, the court may permit that attorney to proceed
(Plant v. Cleveland Reg'l Med. Ctr. (In re Gravitt), 371 S.W.3d 465 (Tex. App.
2012)).

Conclusion
Texas law is unequivocal: when an attorney’s authority to act is challenged
under Rule 12 and the challenge remains unresolved, the court must refuse
to permit that attorney’s appearance and strike pleadings if no authorized
counsel appears. Filing pleadings by an attorney who is not counsel of
record, while the authority of the purported attorney of record is under
challenge and unaddressed, violates these procedural requirements and
exposes the pleadings to being struck. This conduct reflects a disregard for
the rules designed to ensure the orderly administration of justice and may
result in significant sanctions, including the dismissal of claims or defenses.
The authorities cited above leave no doubt that strict adherence to Rule 12
is essential to maintaining the integrity of Texas civil proceedings.
Legal Authorities
Tanner v. Black, 464 S.W.3d 23 (Tex. App. 2015)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
When a party to a lawsuit believes that the suit is being prosecuted or
defended without authority, she may file a sworn motion questioning the
attorney's authority to act. Tex.R. Civ. P. 12. 'Rule 12 has long been the
exclusive method for questioning the authority of an attorney to bring a
suit.'... Upon the filing of a motion to show authority, the challenged attorney
bears the burden to 'show sufficient authority to prosecute or defend the
suit on behalf of the other party.' ... If the challenged attorney fails to show
authority to act, 'the court shall ... strike the pleadings if no person who is
authorized to prosecute or defend appears.'
Summary
The passage confirms: (1) Rule 12 is the exclusive vehicle to challenge an
attorney’s authority; (2) once challenged, the attorney must prove authority;
and (3) failure mandates striking pleadings if no authorized person appears.
This supports arguing that filings by an attorney who has not properly
appeared, combined with failure to resolve a pending Rule 12 challenge to
counsel of record, justifies striking pleadings and supports sanctions for
disregard of procedural rules.

Extract
Rule 12 provides that a party may, by sworn written motion stating that he
believes an attorney is prosecuting or defending a suit or proceeding
without authority, cause the attorney to be cited to appear before the court
and show his authority to act. Tex.R. Civ. P. 12. At the hearing on the motion,
the burden of proof is on the challenged attorney to show sufficient
authority to prosecute or defend the suit on behalf of the other party. Id. If
the challenged attorney fails to show authority, the court “shall refuse to
permit the attorney to appear in the cause, and shall strike the pleadings if
no person who is authorized to prosecute or defend appears.” Id." ... "That
same day, the trial court signed an order finding that the plaintiffs filed no
response, the plaintiff's counsel had not appeared despite receiving notice,
and the plaintiffs' attorneys did not show authority to act on behalf of James.
The trial court also ordered 'that John Phelps and John Leija shall not be
allowed to appear on behalf of James Gravitt through Dinah Plant as next
friend.' The trial court further ordered that if new counsel with authority did
not appear by 5:00 p.m. the next day, July 20, 2010, the plaintiffs' pleadings
'shall be stricken pursuant to Rule 12.'" ... "The trial court granted the
biological father's Rule 12 motion, struck the attorney purporting to act as
next friend, struck the pleadings the unauthorized attorney filed, and
dismissed the case.
Summary
The opinion states the Rule 12 procedure, the attorney’s burden when
authority is challenged, and the mandatory consequence—refusal to permit
appearance and striking pleadings—if authority is not shown. It illustrates
enforcement where counsel failed to respond/appear and the court barred
them from appearing and ordered pleadings struck. It further cites a case
where pleadings filed by an unauthorized attorney were struck and the case
dismissed. This supports arguments that continued filings by a non-
appearing or unauthorized lawyer and failure to address a pending Rule 12
challenge violate procedural requirements and warrant striking pleadings/
sanctions.

to show sufficient authority to prosecute the suit and ... no one authorized to
prosecute the suit appeared at the hearing.
Summary
The opinion quotes Rule 12’s mechanism, burden, and mandatory remedies
(refuse appearance and strike pleadings). It shows application: when
attorneys failed to show authority, the court prohibited their appearance and
ordered pleadings stricken; a cited case confirms striking pleadings filed by
an unauthorized attorney and dismissal when no authorized counsel
appears. This supports that filing pleadings without proper authority and
failing to address a Rule 12 challenge warrants striking pleadings and
sanctions, and underscores disregard for procedural rules.

Sloan v. Rivers, 693 S.W.2d 782 (Tex. App. 1985)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Although such motion was not verified as required by TEX.R.CIV.P. 12, its
substance sufficiently put the Court on notice of a possible irregularity
worthy of further inquiry by the Court. No exception having been taken, the
requirement of verification is deemed waived... At that time he freely
admitted in open court that he did not have the authority of either Denise E.
Sloan or Patricia Ruffin to prosecute the action for injunction... Under these
circumstances, we agree with Respondent Rivers that the provisions of
TEX.R.CIV.P. 12 apply... At the hearing on the motion, the burden of proof
shall be upon the challenged attorney to show sufficient authority to
prosecute or defend the suit on behalf of the other party. Upon his failure to
show such authority, the court shall refuse to permit the attorney to appear
in the cause, and shall strike the pleadings if no person who is authorized to
prosecute or defend appears.
Summary
The court recognized that a Rule 12 challenge triggers the attorney’s
burden to show authority. It affirmed that lack of authority requires the
court to refuse the attorney’s appearance and to strike pleadings if no
authorized person appears. It also shows courts may proceed on the
substance of a Rule 12 challenge to address irregularities in representation.
This supports the proposition that filings by an attorney without proper
authority/appearance, coupled with failure to address a Rule 12 challenge,
warrants striking pleadings and reflects disregard for procedural rules.

Summary
The passage confirms that under Texas Rule 12, once authority is
challenged, the attorney must personally appear and carry the burden to
show authority before continuing to act. This supports arguments that filings
by an attorney who has not properly appeared or whose authority is under
challenge are procedurally improper and subject to sanctions such as
striking pleadings.
Angelina County v. McFarland, 374 S.W.2d 417 (Tex. 1964)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
‘Any defendant in any suit or proceeding pending in any court of this state
may, by sworn written motion stating that such defendant believes that such
suit or proceeding was instituted against him or is being prosecuted against
him without authority on the part of the plaintiff’s attorney, cause such
attorney to be cited to appear before such court and show his authority for
same... Upon the hearing of such motion, the burden of proof shall be upon
the attorney appearing for the plaintiff to show sufficient authority... Upon
his failure to show such authority, the court shall refuse to permit such
attorney to appear in said cause, and shall dismiss the same if no person
who is authorized to prosecute said cause appears... Rule 12 was taken from
Article 320... Its apparent purpose was to discourage and to cause the
dismissal of suits brought without authority. It was to protect defendants
from groundless suits. It was thought that a person who was sued was
entitled to known that the named plaintiff had in fact authorized the suit.
The statute and the Rule were plainly worded to give this right to
defendants; to authorize defendants to challenge the bringing of the suit...
In Victory v. State... this Court held that Article 320 (now Rule 12) ‘provides
for the exclusive method of questioning the authority of an attorney to bring
suit.’
Summary
The Court quotes Rule 12’s mechanism requiring an attorney to show
authority when challenged and states the consequence of failure (refusal to
permit appearance and dismissal if no authorized prosecutor appears). It
affirms Rule 12 as the exclusive method to challenge an attorney’s authority
and explains its purpose to prevent suits prosecuted without authority. This
supports arguments that: (1) a Rule 12 challenge must be adjudicated in the
trial court; (2) when challenged, the burden is on the plaintiff’s attorney to
prove authority; (3) failure to show authority leads to striking the attorney’s

Extract
Rule 12, the alleged basis for Primalend's motion, says that when a party to
a lawsuit believes the suit or proceeding is being prosecuted or defended
without authority, it may file a sworn written motion questioning the
attorney's authority to act. Tex.R.Civ.P. 12. Rule 12 motions must be sworn
and served on the challenged attorney at least 10 days before the hearing on
the motion. ... The primary purpose of rule 12 is to enforce a party's right to
know who authorized the suit. ... Rule 12 protects parties from groundless
suits and permits dismissal of suits instituted without authority. ... The
challenged attorney has the burden of proof to show sufficient authority to
represent the client. ... If the challenged attorney does not meet his or her
burden of proof, the trial court is required (1) to bar the challenged attorney
from appearing in the case and (2) to strike the pleadings if an authorized
person does not appear. ... Typically, an attorney satisfies the burden to
establish his or her authority by presenting evidence the client retained him
to provide representation in the case.
Summary
The passage explains Rule 12’s mechanism to challenge an attorney’s
authority, the burden on the challenged attorney to prove authority, and
mandatory consequences—barring the attorney and striking pleadings—if
the burden is not met. This supports the proposition that continued filings by
an attorney lacking proper appearance and failure to resolve a Rule 12
challenge contravene procedural rules and risk striking of pleadings and
related sanctions.

cites precedent recognizing attorneys may appear of record without
authority, justifying Rule 12 enforcement. This supports arguments that

Failing to follow Rule 12 results in waiver. Kindle, 151 S.W.3d at 210

Summary
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12 is the exclusive mechanism to challenge an
attorney’s authority to act. When such authority is challenged, the attorney
must show authority; failure to comply has consequences (including
potential waiver if not timely raised, and under Rule 12 itself, striking of
pleadings and other sanctions when the challenged attorney cannot show
authority). The passage squarely supports the necessity of addressing a Rule
12 challenge to counsel’s authority and underscores the procedural
importance of proper appearance and authority before filing pleadings.
Phillips v. Phillips, 244 S.W.3d 433 (Tex. App. 2007)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
On the day of hearing on Patricia's motion for new trial, Mauzy filed a
motion to show authority under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12... The trial
court found that Hood lacked authority and struck Patricia's motion for new
trial... Rule 12 has long been the exclusive method for questioning the
authority of an attorney to bring a suit. Angelina County v. McFarland, 374
S.W.2d 417, 423 (Tex. 1964).
Summary
The case confirms that Rule 12 is the proper and exclusive vehicle to
challenge an attorney’s authority to act, and that when a court finds counsel
lacks authority, it may strike filed pleadings (here, a motion for new trial).
This supports the proposition that continued filing by an attorney without
established authority, particularly while a Rule 12 challenge is pending or
unaddressed, violates procedural norms and can result in striking pleadings.
Boudreau v. Federal Trust Bank, 115 S.W.3d 740 (Tex. App. 2003)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Texas civil procedure rule 12 allows a party to argue before the trial court
that the law suit is being prosecuted or defended without authority. Tex.R.
Civ. P. 12. The challenged attorney must appear before the court and show
his authority to act. Id. At the hearing on the motion, the burden of proof is
on the challenged attorney to show sufficient authority to prosecute or
defend the suit on behalf of his client, a party to the law suit. Id. If the
challenged attorney fails to show authority, the trial court must refuse to
permit the attorney to appear in the cause and must strike the pleadings if

no other authorized person appears. Id. A trial should not be unnecessarily
continued or delayed for a rule 12 hearing. Id.
Summary
The opinion recites the requirements and consequences of Texas Rule 12:
when an attorney’s authority is challenged, the attorney must appear and
prove authority; the burden is on the challenged attorney; failure to prove
authority requires the court to refuse the appearance and strike pleadings if
no authorized person appears; and Rule 12 hearings should not delay
proceedings. This directly supports arguments that continued filings by an
attorney who has not properly appeared and has not addressed a pending
Rule 12 challenge violate procedural requirements and risk striking of
pleadings.
Ellis v. Courtney Prince; LVTRise, Inc., 02-25-00162-CV (Tex. App. Aug 14,
2025)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12 provides in pertinent part that [a] party in a
suit or proceeding pending in a court of this state may, by sworn written
motion stating that he believes the suit or proceeding is being prosecuted or
defended without authority, cause the attorney to be cited to appear before
the court and show his authority to act.. .. At the hearing on the motion, the
burden of proof shall be upon the challenged attorney to show sufficient
authority to prosecute or defend the suit on behalf of the other party. Upon
his failure to show such authority, the court shall refuse to permit the
attorney to appear in the cause[] and shall strike the pleadings if no person
who is authorized to prosecute or defend appears." ... "Ellis's arguments
ignore the fact that Rule 12, which is set forth in the Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure, is an authorized procedure[] and that he could have mooted
LVTRise's motion by hiring an attorney and having that attorney appear at
the hearing. Instead, Ellis neither responded to LVTRise's motion nor
appeared for the hearing on the motion but rather continued in the
unauthorized practice of law by filing documents on his daughter's behalf
after the trial court rendered its order striking his pleadings and dismissing
his claims. We therefore overrule Ellis's remaining four issues.
Summary
The court quotes Rule 12’s mechanism, burden, and remedy—on failure to
show authority, the court must refuse the appearance and strike pleadings if
no authorized person appears. The court further emphasizes Rule 12 as an
authorized procedure and affirms striking pleadings where filings continued
without proper authority. This supports that when the authority of the
purported attorney of record is challenged and not addressed, the court can

refuse the appearance and strike pleadings, and continued filings without
proper appearance reflect disregard of procedural rules.
Fulcher v. Texas State Bd. of Public Accountancy, 571 S.W.2d 366 (Tex. Ct.
App. 1978)
Texas Civil Court of Appeals
Extract
Rule 12 is the exclusive method for questioning the authority of an attorney
to bring a suit. Angelina County v. McFarland, 374 S.W.2d 417, 423 (Tex.Sup.
1964); Cook v. City of Booker, 167 S.W.2d 232, 233 (Tex.Civ.App. Amarillo
1942, no writ). In order for Fulcher to have properly challenged the
authority of the Attorney General to represent the Texas State Board of
Public Accountancy it was his duty to invoke Rule 12 by filing a sworn
written motion contesting the Attorney General's authority.... In Cook, supra,
the court stated that a plea in abatement was not sufficient to challenge an
attorney's authority to represent a plaintiff, but that a Rule 12 motion is the
exclusive method for challenging this authority. ... 'Any defendant in any suit
or proceeding pending in any court of this state may, by sworn written
motion stating that such defendant believes that such suit or proceeding was
instituted against him or is being prosecuted against him without authority
on the part of the plaintiff's attorney, cause such attorney to be cited to
appear before such court and show his authority for same... Upon the
hearing of such motion, the burden of proof shall be upon the attorney
appearing for the plaintiff to show sufficient authority... Upon his failure to
show such authority, the court shall refuse to permit such attorney to appear
in said cause, and shall dismiss the same if no person who is authorized to
prosecute said cause appears.'
Summary
The case confirms that Rule 12 is the exclusive vehicle to challenge an
attorney’s authority, requires a sworn motion, places the burden on the
challenged attorney to prove authority, and authorizes the court to refuse
the appearance and dismiss if authority is not shown. This supports
arguments that (1) counsel’s authority must be addressed when challenged;
(2) filing pleadings without established authority violates procedural
requirements; and (3) courts may strike appearances and dismiss if
authority is lacking—underscoring the seriousness of continued filings by an
unauthorized attorney.
Nolana Open MRI Ctr., Inc. v. Pechero, NUMBER 13-13-00552-CV (Tex. App.
Feb 12, 2015)
Texas Court of Appeals

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
There is a general presumption that an attorney is acting with authority;
however, that presumption is rebuttable... Rule 12 of the Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure permits any party to challenge an attorney's authority to
prosecute or defend a lawsuit: [A party] may, by sworn written motion...
cause the attorney to be cited to appear before the court and show his
authority to act... The challenged attorney must appear before the trial court
to show his authority to act on behalf of his client... At the hearing on the
motion, the challenged attorney bears the burden of proof to show the
requisite authority... Typically, a challenged attorney satisfies his burden if
he produces an affidavit or testimony from his client indicating the attorney
was retained to provide representation in the case.
Summary
Texas Rule 12 allows a party to challenge an attorney’s authority, requires
the challenged attorney to appear and show authority, and places the burden
on that attorney to prove authority, typically via client affidavit/testimony.
This supports the proposition that an attorney filing pleadings without
proper appearance or unaddressed authority must demonstrate authority
and, if failing to do so, faces consequences (including striking pleadings
under Rule 12, as recognized in Texas practice). The appellate standard
underscores courts must apply these guiding rules, reinforcing the orderly
administration of justice rationale.
In re Sassin, 511 S.W.3d 121 (Tex. App. 2014)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Rule 12 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure permits any party to challenge
an attorney's authority to prosecute or defend a lawsuit. TEX.R.CIV.P. 12.
The Rule's primary purpose is to enforce a party's right to know who
authorized the suit... The challenged attorney must appear before the trial
court to show his authority to act on behalf of his client... At the hearing on
the motion, the challenged attorney bears the burden of proof to show the
requisite authority.
Summary
The passage confirms that (1) any party may challenge an attorney’s
authority under Rule 12; (2) the challenged attorney must personally appear
and prove authority; and (3) the burden rests on the challenged attorney.
This supports arguments that filings by an attorney who has not appeared or
shown authority after a Rule 12 challenge are improper and subject to
remedial measures (including striking), reinforcing the need to resolve the
challenge before further critical filings.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Rule 12 allows a party to argue before the trial court that a suit is being
prosecuted or defended without authority. Tex.R. Civ. P. 12; ... When a party
files a rule 12 motion to show authority, the challenged attorney must
appear before the trial court to show his authority to act on behalf of his
client. Tex.R. Civ. P. 12; ... The motion may be heard and determined at any
time before the parties have announced ready for trial. Tex.R. Civ. P. 12. The
primary purpose of rule 12 is to enforce a party's right to know who
authorized the suit." ... "The current version of rule 12 allows either a
defendant or a plaintiff to file a rule 12 motion. Tex.R. Civ. P. 12 ('A party in a
suit or proceeding pending in a court of this state may, by sworn written
motion stating he believes the suit or proceeding is being prosecuted or
defended without authority, cause the attorney to be cited to appear before
the court and show his authority to act.') (emphasis supplied).
Summary
The court explains Rule 12’s mechanism: when authority is challenged, the
attorney must appear and show authority. It confirms any party may file a
Rule 12 motion. This supports arguing that continued filings by an attorney
who has not properly appeared and whose authority is under a Rule 12
challenge violate procedural requirements, exposing pleadings to being
struck and sanctions under Rule 12’s enforcement of authorized
representation.
In re Users Systems Serv., 22 S.W.3d 331 (Tex. 1999)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The court was also troubled that Cannan's responsibilities as counsel of
record under Rules 8 and 10 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure could not
be terminated by Frazier's letter to Gulde but only by notice to the trial
court, which was not given, so that Cannan remained Frazier's counsel of
record during the meeting with Landreth and Gulde." ... "Nor is the client's
right to terminate the relationship limited by the attorney's responsibilities
to a court as counsel of record for the client. Rule 8 of the Texas Rules of
Civil Procedure makes a party's 'attorney in charge' 'responsible for the suit
as to such party', and Rule 10 specifies when and how counsel may
withdraw. But neither rule speaks to the client's right to terminate the
representation or requires that notice first be given to the court. On the
other hand, the procedure prescribed by Rule 12 for requiring an attorney to

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
show his authority to act for a party presupposes the possibility that an
attorney can be counsel of record for a party he is not authorized to
represent. The rules contemplate that authorization may not have existed or
may cease before the attorney has withdrawn from the case.
Summary
The Court recognizes that (1) counsel of record remains responsible until
proper withdrawal by notice to the court; (2) Rule 12 exists because an
attorney of record may lack actual authority; and (3) the rules contemplate
periods when filings may be made by someone without authority or when
counsel of record lacks authority. This supports arguments that filings by a
non-appearing lawyer, and failure to resolve a Rule 12 challenge to the
purported attorney of record’s authority, violate procedural requirements
and warrant remedial measures (including striking pleadings).
Nicholas v. Envtl. Sys. (Int'l) Ltd., 499 S.W.3d 888 (Tex. App. 2016)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
We review a trial court's ruling on a Rule 12 motion to show authority for an
abuse of discretion. ... Rule 12, titled 'Attorney to Show Authority,' provides,
in pertinent part: A party in a suit or proceeding pending in a court of this
state may, by sworn written motion stating that he believes the suit or

Summary
The passage confirms that, when challenged under Rule 12, an attorney
must show authority to act; the burden is on the challenged attorney; and
failure to show authority requires the court to refuse to permit the attorney
to act—supporting consequences such as striking pleadings or disallowing
further participation. This aligns with the proposition that continued filings
by an attorney without proper authority and failure to resolve a Rule 12
challenge contravene procedural rules.
Rule 12. Attorney to Show Authority

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
A party in a suit or proceeding pending in a court of this state may, by sworn
written motion stating that he believes the suit or proceeding is being
prosecuted or defended without authority, cause the attorney to be cited to
appear before the court and show his authority to act. ... At the hearing on
the motion, the burden of proof shall be upon the challenged attorney to
show sufficient authority to prosecute or defend the suit on behalf of the
other party. Upon his failure to show such authority, the court shall refuse to
permit the attorney to appear in the cause, and shall strike the pleadings if
no person who is authorized to prosecute or defend appears.
Summary
Texas Rule 12 provides a mechanism to challenge an attorney’s authority
and places the burden on the challenged attorney to prove authority. If the
challenged attorney cannot show authority, the court must refuse that
attorney’s appearance and strike pleadings absent an authorized
representative. This directly supports the proposition that filing pleadings by
an attorney without proper authority—especially while a Rule 12 challenge
remains unresolved—violates procedural requirements and can lead to
striking pleadings, evidencing disregard for orderly procedure.
