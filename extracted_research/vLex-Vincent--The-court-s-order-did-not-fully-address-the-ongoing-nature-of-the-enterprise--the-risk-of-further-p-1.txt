Question
The court’s order did not fully address the ongoing nature of the enterprise,
the risk of further predicate acts, or the open-ended continuity required
under RICO. A motion for reconsideration under Rule 59(e) is appropriate
where the court has overlooked material facts or controlling law, or where
necessary to prevent manifest injustice (Servants of Paraclete v. Does, 204 F.
3d 1005, 1012 (10th Cir. 2000)). Because the court overlooked material
allegations and controlling law regarding open-ended continuity,
reconsideration should be granted to allow the case to proceed on the merits
or, at minimum, to permit amendment of the complaint. 
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
A motion for reconsideration under Rule 59(e) is well-supported where the
court has overlooked material allegations and controlling law regarding
open-ended continuity under RICO, as the pattern requirement demands a
careful analysis of the ongoing nature of the enterprise and the risk of future
predicate acts. The authorities provided demonstrate that reconsideration is
appropriate to address these overlooked aspects, either to allow the case to
proceed on the merits or to permit amendment of the complaint.
Summary
The RICO statute requires plaintiffs to establish a "pattern of racketeering
activity," which, as interpreted by the Supreme Court and the Tenth Circuit,
includes both a relationship among predicate acts and a threat of continuing
criminal activity—either through closed-ended or open-ended continuity.
Open-ended continuity, in particular, is satisfied where the predicate acts
pose a threat of future repetition or are part of the regular way an ongoing
enterprise conducts its business, and courts must conduct a fact-specific
inquiry to determine whether this standard is met.
If a court fails to address the ongoing nature of the enterprise, the risk of
further predicate acts, or the open-ended continuity requirement, it
overlooks material facts and controlling law central to the RICO analysis. In
such circumstances, Rule 59(e) provides a mechanism for reconsideration to
prevent manifest injustice, and the authorities confirm that such a motion is
appropriate to ensure the case is properly adjudicated or, at minimum, to
allow amendment of the complaint to cure any deficiencies.

Background and Relevant Law
RICO’s Pattern Requirement and Continuity
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) requires a
plaintiff to demonstrate a "pattern of racketeering activity," which is not
satisfied merely by alleging two or more predicate acts. Instead, the
Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. established
that a pattern requires both a relationship among the predicate acts and
continuity, which can be either closed-ended or open-ended, depending on
the facts of the case (H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229
(1989), as discussed in Watchous Enterprrises, LLC v. Pac. Nat'l Capital,
LLC, Case No. 16-1432-JTM (D. Kan. Jul 25, 2018); List Interactive, Ltd. v.
Knights of Columbus, 303 F.Supp.3d 1065 (D. Colo. 2018); and summarized
in RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31)).
Closed-ended continuity refers to a series of related predicate acts
extending over a substantial period, while open-ended continuity refers to
conduct that, by its nature, projects into the future with a threat of
repetition (List Interactive, Ltd. v. Knights of Columbus, 303 F.Supp.3d 1065
(D. Colo. 2018); Friedlob v. Trustees of Alpine Mut. Fund Trust, 905 F.Supp.
843 (D. Colo. 1995); Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of Action). Open-ended
continuity may be established by showing that the predicate acts are part of
an ongoing entity’s regular way of doing business or that there is a specific
threat of repetition extending indefinitely into the future (RICO: A Primer
(2022-01-31); Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of Action).
The Tenth Circuit and district courts within its jurisdiction have consistently
applied this framework, requiring plaintiffs to allege not only multiple
predicate acts but also facts demonstrating a threat of continuing
racketeering activity, particularly when open-ended continuity is at issue
(Taylor v. Chesapeake Operating, Inc., Case No. CIV-18-565-D (W.D. Okla.
Nov 20, 2019); Apache Tribe of Okla. v. Brown, 966 F.Supp.2d 1188 (W.D.
Okla. 2013); Pti Grp., Inc. v. Gift Card Impressions, LLC, Case No. 14-2063-
CM (D. Kan. Sep 16, 2014); Gotfredson v. Larsen Lp, 432 F.Supp.2d 1163 (D.
Colo. 2006)).
Rule 59(e) Standard
A motion for reconsideration under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) is
appropriate where the court has overlooked material facts or controlling
law, or where necessary to prevent manifest injustice (Servants of Paraclete
v. Does, 204 F.3d 1005, 1012 (10th Cir. 2000), as referenced in the user’s
question). This standard is met when the court’s order fails to address
essential elements of a claim, such as the ongoing nature of the enterprise
or the risk of future predicate acts in a RICO case.

Analysis
The Court’s Duty to Address Open-Ended Continuity
The authorities make clear that a court must conduct a fact-specific inquiry
into whether the alleged predicate acts pose a threat of continued
racketeering activity, especially when open-ended continuity is alleged. The
Supreme Court’s decision in H.J. Inc. and its progeny require courts to look
beyond the mere number of predicate acts and to consider whether those
acts are related and whether they demonstrate a threat of ongoing criminal
conduct (Watchous Enterprrises, LLC v. Pac. Nat'l Capital, LLC, Case No.
16-1432-JTM (D. Kan. Jul 25, 2018); List Interactive, Ltd. v. Knights of
Columbus, 303 F.Supp.3d 1065 (D. Colo. 2018); RICO: A Primer
(2022-01-31)).
Open-ended continuity is established where the predicate acts are part of
the regular way an ongoing enterprise conducts its business or where the
acts themselves pose a specific threat of repetition into the future (Chapter
4. Elements of Cause of Action; Gotfredson v. Larsen Lp, 432 F.Supp.2d 1163
(D. Colo. 2006)). The Tenth Circuit has repeatedly emphasized that
continuity is a central, temporal concept in the RICO context, and that the
threat of continued racketeering activity is a function of the particular facts
of each case (List Interactive, Ltd. v. Knights of Columbus, 303 F.Supp.3d
1065 (D. Colo. 2018); Friedlob v. Trustees of Alpine Mut. Fund Trust, 905
F.Supp. 843 (D. Colo. 1995)).
If the court’s order failed to analyze whether the alleged enterprise’s
conduct projected into the future with a threat of repetition, or whether the
predicate acts were part of the regular way the enterprise conducted its
business, it overlooked a material element of the RICO claim. This is not a
mere technicality; the pattern requirement is fundamental to RICO liability,
and failure to address it constitutes an error of law and fact (Watchous
Enterprrises, LLC v. Pac. Nat'l Capital, LLC, Case No. 16-1432-JTM (D. Kan.
Jul 25, 2018); Apache Tribe of Okla. v. Brown, 966 F.Supp.2d 1188 (W.D.
Okla. 2013)).
Application of Rule 59(e) in This Context
Rule 59(e) allows a court to alter or amend a judgment where it has
overlooked material facts or controlling law, or to prevent manifest injustice
(Servants of Paraclete v. Does, 204 F.3d 1005, 1012 (10th Cir. 2000)). The
failure to address open-ended continuity—where the complaint alleges facts
supporting a threat of future racketeering activity or that the predicate acts
are part of the enterprise’s regular business—constitutes such an oversight.
The authorities confirm that courts must examine whether the facts alleged
support a finding of open-ended continuity, and that this inquiry is inherently
fact-specific (RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31); Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of
Action; Gotfredson v. Larsen Lp, 432 F.Supp.2d 1163 (D. Colo. 2006)). If the
court’s order summarily dismissed the RICO claim without engaging with

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
these allegations, a motion for reconsideration is not only appropriate but
necessary to ensure the claim is properly adjudicated.
Moreover, the authorities recognize that, where a complaint’s deficiencies
are curable, leave to amend should be freely granted, especially in the
context of a motion for reconsideration that highlights overlooked facts or
law (Pti Grp., Inc. v. Gift Card Impressions, LLC, Case No. 14-2063-CM (D.
Kan. Sep 16, 2014)). Thus, at a minimum, the court should permit
amendment of the complaint to address any perceived deficiencies
regarding open-ended continuity.
Synthesis of the Authorities
The Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit authorities, as well as district court
decisions within the circuit, are uniform in their insistence that the pattern
requirement under RICO is not satisfied by a mechanical tally of predicate
acts. Instead, courts must consider whether the acts are related and
whether they pose a threat of continued criminal activity, with open-ended
continuity being established by a threat of future repetition or by showing
that the acts are part of the regular way the enterprise conducts its business
(Watchous Enterprrises, LLC v. Pac. Nat'l Capital, LLC, Case No. 16-1432-
JTM (D. Kan. Jul 25, 2018); List Interactive, Ltd. v. Knights of Columbus, 303
F.Supp.3d 1065 (D. Colo. 2018); Gotfredson v. Larsen Lp, 432 F.Supp.2d
1163 (D. Colo. 2006); Friedlob v. Trustees of Alpine Mut. Fund Trust, 905
F.Supp. 843 (D. Colo. 1995); Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of Action).
Secondary materials reinforce this point, emphasizing that open-ended
continuity is satisfied where the threat of continued criminal activity is
present, and that courts must examine the facts of each case to determine
whether this standard is met (RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31); Racketeer
influenced and corrupt organizations (2011-03-22); Racketeer influenced
and corrupt organizations (2023-07-01)).
If the court’s order did not address these issues, it failed to apply controlling
law and overlooked material facts, justifying reconsideration under Rule
59(e).
Exceptions and Caveats
While the authorities are clear that open-ended continuity is a fact-specific
inquiry, courts have also cautioned that not every scheme involving a small
number of acts or a single victim will satisfy the continuity requirement
(Skurkey v. Daniel (W.D. Okla. 2023)). However, this does not diminish the
necessity for the court to engage with the allegations and to explain why the
facts do or do not establish a threat of continued racketeering activity.
Additionally, courts have recognized that a single fraudulent effort, even if
implemented by several acts, may not constitute a pattern if it does not pose
a threat of ongoing criminal activity (Professional Assets Manage. v. Penn
Square Bank, 616 F.Supp. 1418 (W.D. Okla. 1985)). Nevertheless, the key

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
point is that the court must make this determination based on the facts
alleged, not by ignoring the open-ended continuity analysis altogether.
Conclusion
In sum, the authorities provided uniformly support the proposition that a
court’s failure to address the ongoing nature of the enterprise, the risk of
further predicate acts, or the open-ended continuity required under RICO
constitutes an oversight of material facts and controlling law. Rule 59(e) is
designed to remedy such errors, and reconsideration is appropriate to
ensure that the RICO claim is properly evaluated on the merits or, at a
minimum, to allow amendment of the complaint to cure any deficiencies.
The pattern requirement under RICO is a nuanced, fact-specific inquiry, and
courts must engage with the allegations regarding continuity—especially
open-ended continuity—before dismissing a claim. Failure to do so warrants
reconsideration to prevent manifest injustice and to ensure the proper
application of RICO’s substantive requirements.

To establish a pattern under RICO, plaintiff must also show that the alleged
predicate acts amount to, or otherwise constitute a threat of, 'continuing
racketeering activity.' Id. 'Continuity' is both a closed-ended and open-ended
concept. Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir.
1993). Plaintiff 'may demonstrate continuity over a closed period by proving
a series of related predicates extending over a substantial period of time.'
Id. (citing H.J., Inc., 492 U.S. at 242, 109 S.Ct. at 2902); see Phelps, 886 F.2d
at 1273. In contrast, 'open-ended continuity depends upon the facts of each
case, and may be established by showing that the predicates themselves

Summary
Requirement under RICO to establish a pattern of racketeering activity,
which includes demonstrating continuity. It distinguishes between closed-
ended and open-ended continuity, emphasizing that open-ended continuity
involves a threat of long-term racketeering activity. This directly relates to
the proposition that the court may have overlooked the ongoing nature of
the enterprise and the risk of further predicate acts, which are essential to
establishing open-ended continuity under RICO.

The recent case of Northern Trust Bank/O'Hare v. Inryco, Inc., 615 F.Supp.
828 (N.D.Ill.1985), applied Sedima's interpretation of RICO to a kickback
scheme including several separate entities, payments and bank accounts.
The Inryco court reasoned that '`pattern' ... connotes a multiplicity of
events. Surely the continuity inherent in the term presumes repeated
criminal activity, not merely repeated acts to carry out the same criminal
activity. It places a real strain on the language to speak of a single
fraudulent effort, implemented by several fraudulent acts, as a 'pattern of
racketeering activity.' (citation).
Summary
Interpretation of "pattern" under RICO, emphasizing the need for continuity
and repeated criminal activity rather than isolated acts. This supports the

=== PAGE 7 ===

proposition that the court may have overlooked the ongoing nature of the
enterprise and the risk of further predicate acts, which are essential for
establishing a RICO pattern. The passage suggests that a single fraudulent
effort does not meet the RICO pattern requirement, implying that the court
should reconsider its decision if it failed to address these aspects.

“[T]o satisfy RICO's pattern requirement, [a plaintiff must] allege not only
that the defendants had committed two or more predicate acts, but also that
the predicates themselves amount to, or that they otherwise constitute a
threat of, continuing racketeering activity.” Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d 751,
761 (10th Cir.2010) (quoting Hall v. Witteman, 584 F.3d 859, 867 (10th Cir.
2009)) (emphasis in original). “ ‘[T]he term pattern itself requires the
showing of a relationship between the predicates and of the threat of
continuing activity,’ so that it is ‘ continuity plus relationship which
combines to produce a pattern.’ ”
Summary
The passage emphasizes the requirement under RICO to demonstrate not
just multiple predicate acts, but also a threat of ongoing racketeering
activity, which aligns with the concept of open-ended continuity. This
supports the proposition that the court may have overlooked the ongoing
nature of the enterprise and the risk of further predicate acts, which are
crucial for establishing a RICO pattern. The passage underscores the
necessity of showing both continuity and relationship between predicate
acts, which is central to the argument for reconsideration.
Skurkey v. Daniel

The same holds true if the Court considers whether Plaintiff has alleged
continuity under an open-ended theory because Plaintiff has not alleged
facts that show a clear threat of future criminal conduct related to past
criminal conduct. H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 242. Courts have uniformly and
consistently held that schemes involving a single, narrow purpose and one
or few participants directed towards a single victim do not satisfy the RICO
requirement of a closed or open pattern of continuity.

Summary
The court in "Skurkey v. Daniel" addressed the issue of open-ended
continuity under RICO. The court noted that the plaintiff failed to allege
facts showing a clear threat of future criminal conduct, which is necessary
to establish open-ended continuity. This aligns with the proposition that the
court may have overlooked material allegations regarding open-ended
continuity, which is a critical component of a RICO claim. The passage
supports the argument that a motion for reconsideration could be
appropriate if the court did not fully consider these aspects.

A pattern of activity under the RICO statute means 'a series of related
predicates that together demonstrate the existence or threat of continued
criminal activity.' RJR Nabsico v. European Community, 136 S.Ct. 2090, 2096
(2016). This threat of continuity may be shown by demonstrating that 'the
predicate acts or offenses are part of an ongoing entity's regular way of
doing business.' H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 249 (1989).
Summary
Definition of a "pattern of activity" under the RICO statute, emphasizing the
need to demonstrate a "series of related predicates" that show a "threat of
continued criminal activity." It further explains that this continuity can be
shown if the predicate acts are part of an ongoing entity's regular business.
This directly relates to the proposition that the court's order did not fully
address the ongoing nature of the enterprise or the open-ended continuity
required under RICO. The passage supports the argument that the court
may have overlooked these aspects, which are crucial for establishing a
RICO claim.
Schrag v. Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543 (D. Kan. 1992)
U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
With respect to the 'continuity' requirement, the Supreme Court stated that
the predicate acts must amount to, or pose a threat of, continuing
racketeering activity. Id. According to the Supreme Court, continuity 'is both
a closed- and open-ended concept, referring to a closed period of repeated
conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
threat of repetition.' Id. A RICO plaintiff 'may demonstrate continuity over a
closed period by proving a series of related predicates extending over a
substantial period of time.' Id. Predicates extending over merely a few
weeks or months, on the other hand, may satisfy the continuity element if
there is a threat of repetition in the future. This latter concept of continuity,
which occurs over an 'open period,' is established by showing that the
predicate acts are a 'regular way of conducting the enterprise's ongoing
business.'
Summary
Concept of "continuity" in the context of RICO, explaining that it can be
either closed-ended or open-ended. The open-ended continuity is
particularly relevant to the proposition, as it involves a threat of future
repetition of predicate acts, which aligns with the argument that the court's
order did not fully address the ongoing nature of the enterprise or the risk
of further predicate acts. The passage supports the idea that if the court
overlooked these aspects, a motion for reconsideration could be appropriate.

established by showing that the predicates themselves involve a distinct
threat of long-term racketeering activity, either implicit or explicit, or that
the predicates are a regular way of conducting the defendant's ongoing
legitimate business or the RICO enterprise.' Id. Open-ended continuity
requires a clear threat of future criminal conduct. Erikson v. Farmers Group,
Inc., 151 Fed.Appx. 672, 677 (10th Cir.2005) (citing Phelps v. Wichita Eagle-
Beacon, 886 F.2d 1262, 1273 [10th Cir.1989]).
Summary
Concept of open-ended continuity in RICO cases, emphasizing that it can be
established by showing a threat of long-term racketeering activity or that
the predicates are a regular way of conducting business. This directly
relates to the proposition that the court may have overlooked material
allegations regarding open-ended continuity, which is a crucial element in
RICO claims. The passage supports the argument that if the court did not

Extract
However, even if UKnight met its burden to show a relationship between the
predicate acts, it has failed to sufficiently allege 'continuity' of the alleged
racketeering activities. As the Supreme Court has explained, Continuity is
both a closed- and open-ended concept, referring either to a closed period of
repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition. It is, in either case, centrally a temporal
concept—and particularly so in the RICO context, where what must be
continuous, RICO's predicate acts or offenses, and the relationship these
predicates must bear one to another, are distinct requirements. H.J., 492
U.S. at 241–42, 109 S.Ct. 2893. The Supreme Court has determined 'that
when Congress said predicates must demonstrate ‘continuity’ before they
may form a RICO pattern, it expressed an intent that RICO reach activities
that amount to or threaten long-term criminal activity.' Bixler v. Foster, 596

2893 ). As such, UKnight must show that the alleged Insurance Fraud
Enterprise's activities 'amount to or threaten long-term criminal activity.'
Summary
Requirement of "continuity" in RICO cases, which is a central issue in the
proposition. It explains that continuity can be either closed-ended or open-
ended, with the latter involving conduct that projects into the future with a
threat of repetition. The passage cites Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit
cases to emphasize that RICO is intended to address activities that threaten
long-term criminal activity. This directly relates to the proposition's
argument that the court overlooked the ongoing nature of the enterprise
and the risk of further predicate acts, which are essential for establishing
open-ended continuity under RICO.

The 'continuity' prong is satisfied by proof of either closed-ended continuity
or open-ended continuity. Closed-ended continuity in the RICO context may
be demonstrated 'by proving a series of related predicates extending over a
substantial period of time.' Open-ended continuity in the RICO context is
conduct that may last only a short period of time but nonetheless, poses a
threat of extending into the future. The Court suggested a case-by-case
examination of this issue, noting that the existence of a 'threat of continued
racketeering activity' is a function of particular facts.
Summary
The passage explains the concept of open-ended continuity under RICO,
which is relevant to the proposition that the court overlooked material
allegations regarding this aspect. The passage highlights that open-ended
continuity involves conduct that poses a threat of extending into the future,
which aligns with the argument that the court did not fully address the
ongoing nature of the enterprise and the risk of further predicate acts. The
passage also emphasizes the need for a case-by-case examination,
suggesting that the court may have failed to consider specific facts that
demonstrate a threat of continued racketeering activity.

Extract
The 'continuity' component is met by either closed-ended continuity, defined
as 'a series of related predicates extending over a substantial period of
time,' or open-ended continuity, defined as conduct that poses a threat of
extending into the future. The Court suggested a case-by-case examination
of this issue, noting that the existence of a 'threat of continued racketeering
activity' is a function of particular facts. The Court offered a non-exhaustive
list of situations that may constitute a pattern, and stated 'development of
these concepts must await future cases.'
Summary
Concept of continuity under RICO, which is central to the proposition. It
explains that continuity can be either closed-ended or open-ended, with
open-ended continuity involving conduct that poses a threat of extending
into the future. This directly relates to the proposition's assertion that the
court did not fully address the ongoing nature of the enterprise or the risk of
further predicate acts. The passage also notes that the determination of
continuity is a case-by-case issue, which supports the argument for
reconsideration if the court overlooked these aspects.

Summary
Detailed explanation of the "continuity" requirement under RICO,
distinguishing between closed-ended and open-ended continuity. It
emphasizes that open-ended continuity involves conduct that poses a threat
of extending into the future, which is relevant to the proposition that the
court overlooked material allegations regarding open-ended continuity. The
passage also references specific cases where courts have found a threat of
continued racketeering activity, supporting the argument that the court's
order may have failed to fully address this aspect.

Summary
Definition of open-ended continuity under RICO, which is relevant to the
proposition that the court's order did not fully address this aspect. The
passage emphasizes that open-ended continuity involves conduct that poses
a threat of extending into the future, which aligns with the argument that
the court overlooked material allegations regarding the ongoing nature of
the enterprise and the risk of further predicate acts. The passage also notes
that the existence of a threat of continued racketeering activity is a function
of particular facts, supporting the need for a case-by-case examination,
which the court may have failed to conduct.

Extract
The Supreme Court introduced the closed-ended and open-ended standards
in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. to underscore the Court’s
view that 'there is something to a RICO pattern beyond simply the number
of predicate acts involved.' The Court announced a two-prong 'continuity
plus relationship' test to determine what constitutes a pattern under the
statute. ... Second, the 'continuity' prong is satisfied either by a series of
related predicate acts extending over a significant period of time (closed-
ended conspiracy), or a short-lived series of acts that also establish a threat
of long-term activity (open-ended conspiracy). The 'threat' of continued
racketeering activity may be shown by evidence that the predicate acts are
part of the RICO defendant’s 'regular way of doing business' or that they are
'a regular means of conducting or participating in an ongoing RICO
enterprise.' The Court called for a case-by-case examination of this issue.
Summary
The Supreme Court has established a "continuity plus relationship" test for
determining a pattern of racketeering under RICO. The "continuity" prong
can be satisfied by demonstrating either a closed-ended or open-ended
conspiracy. The open-ended conspiracy is particularly relevant here, as it
involves a short-lived series of acts that pose a threat of long-term activity,
which the court may have overlooked. This supports the argument that the
court's order did not fully address the ongoing nature of the enterprise or
the risk of further predicate acts, justifying a motion for reconsideration.

Extract
The 'continuity' prong is satisfied by proof of either closed-ended continuity
or open-ended continuity. Closed-ended continuity in the RICO context may
be demonstrated 'by proving a series of related predicates extending over a
substantial period of time.' Open-ended continuity in the RICO context is
conduct that may last only a short period of time but nonetheless poses a
threat of extending into the future. The Court suggested a case-by-case
examination of this issue, noting that the existence of a 'threat of continued
racketeering activity' is a function of particular facts.
Summary
The passage explains the concept of "continuity" under RICO, which can be
either closed-ended or open-ended. Open-ended continuity is particularly
relevant to the proposition because it involves conduct that poses a threat of
continuing into the future, which the court may have overlooked. The
passage also emphasizes the need for a case-by-case examination,
suggesting that the court should have considered the specific facts of the
case to determine the threat of continued racketeering activity.

Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of Action
Civil RICO: A Definitive Guide. Fifth Edition - American Bar
Association - Gregory P. Joseph
Extract
Under the “less inflexible approach” adopted in H.J. Inc., continuity is “both
a closed- and open-ended concept.” Id. at 241. Closed-ended continuity
refers “to a closed period of repeated conduct,” while open-ended continuity
denotes “past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a
threat of repetition.” ... Open-ended continuity, in contrast, requires proof of
“a threat of continued racketeering activity.” Id. at 242. Under H.J. Inc.,
open-ended continuity may be established in various ways. The Court
furnished some examples. First, a small number of related predicates
occurring close together in time will establish open-ended continuity if “the
racketeering acts themselves include a specific threat of repetition
extending indefinitely into the future, and thus supply the requisite threat of
continuity.” Second, the threat of continuity may be established with a
“showing that the predicate acts or offenses are part of an ongoing entity’s
regular way of doing business.” Third, continuity is proved “if the predicates
can be attributed to a defendant operating as part of a long‑term association
that exists for criminal purposes.”
Summary
The passage from the guide explains the concept of continuity under RICO,
distinguishing between closed-ended and open-ended continuity. It provides
examples of how open-ended continuity can be established, such as when
predicate acts are part of an ongoing entity's regular way of doing business
or when there is a specific threat of repetition. This directly supports the
proposition that the court may have overlooked material allegations
regarding open-ended continuity, which is a critical element in RICO cases.

The continuity requirement is likewise satisfied where the predicates are a
regular way of conducting the defendant's ongoing legitimate business (in
the sense that it is not a business that exists for criminal purposes), or of
conducting or participating in an ongoing and legitimate RICO 'enterprise.'
A plaintiff may demonstrate a pattern by establishment that the predicate
acts pose a threat of continued criminal activity, which is generally
demonstrated by showing either: * Closed-ended continuity. Proving 'a series

Open-ended continuity. A threat of 'continuing criminal activity extending

Summary
The continuity requirement under RICO can be satisfied by demonstrating
either closed-ended or open-ended continuity. Open-ended continuity
involves a threat of continuing criminal activity extending indefinitely into
the future, which is relevant to the proposition that the court overlooked
material allegations regarding open-ended continuity. This supports the
argument for reconsideration under Rule 59(e) due to the court's oversight
of these aspects.
