Question
The presiding judge is the subject of a recusal motion and has failed to refer
the motion to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Texas as required by
statute. Tex. Gov’t Code § 25.00255 requires that if the presiding judge is
the subject of a recusal motion, the motion must be referred to the Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court for assignment of another judge to hear and
rule on the motion. Failure to do so is a violation of statutory law and due
process. Judge Evans’s failure to follow this mandatory referral procedure is
itself grounds for recusal and for vacating any orders issued in violation of
the statute.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
Judge Evans’s failure to refer a recusal motion against himself to the Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court of Texas, as mandated by Tex. Gov’t Code §
25.00255, constitutes a violation of statutory law and due process. This
procedural failure is itself grounds for recusal and renders any orders issued
by Judge Evans after the improper handling of the motion void.
Summary
Texas law requires that when a presiding judge is the subject of a recusal
motion, the judge must either recuse themselves or refer the motion to the
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court for assignment of another judge to hear
and rule on the motion. The Texas Supreme Court has repeatedly held that
this referral procedure is mandatory, and a judge’s failure to comply with it
is a violation of both statutory law and due process, resulting in the
invalidation of any subsequent orders issued by that judge.
In the scenario described, Judge Evans’s failure to follow the mandatory
referral procedure under Tex. Gov’t Code § 25.00255 is itself a basis for
recusal and for vacating any orders he issued in violation of the statute. The
relevant statutory provisions, administrative regulations, and controlling
case law all support this conclusion, and there are no recognized exceptions
that would excuse noncompliance with these requirements.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
The central statutory authority governing the recusal or disqualification of
judges in Texas statutory probate courts is Tex. Gov’t Code § 25.00255. The
statute explicitly provides that if a presiding judge is the subject of a recusal
or disqualification motion, the judge must sign and file an order referring

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the motion to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. The Chief Justice is
then responsible for assigning another qualified judge to hear and rule on
the motion. This process is not discretionary; the statute’s language is
mandatory and leaves no room for alternative procedures or judicial
discretion in this context (Tex. Gov’t Code § 25.00255).
Complementing this statutory requirement, 1 Tex. Admin. Code § 155.152
provides that if the presiding judge does not voluntarily disqualify or recuse
themselves, the Chief Judge or their designee must assign another judge to
consider and rule on the motion. This regulatory provision reinforces the
statutory mandate and underscores the importance of impartiality and
procedural fairness in the adjudication of recusal motions (1 Tex. Admin.
Code § 155.152).
Case Law
The Texas Supreme Court has repeatedly interpreted and enforced the
mandatory nature of the recusal referral process. In Gonzalez v. Guilbot, 315
S.W.3d 533 (Tex. 2010), the court held that under Tex. Gov’t Code §
25.00255, a judge who is the subject of a recusal motion has only two
options: grant the motion or refer it to another judge for a ruling. The court
found that when a judge improperly rules on their own recusal motion,
rather than referring it as required, all subsequent orders issued by that
judge are void.
Similarly, in Hudson v. Texas Children’s Hosp., 177 S.W.3d 232 (Tex. 2005),
the Texas Supreme Court reaffirmed that the recuse-or-refer procedure is
mandatory. The court emphasized that once a recusal motion is filed, the
judge must either recuse themselves or request that the presiding judge
assign another judge to hear the motion, and that any deviation from this
process constitutes a violation of statutory law and due process.
In Perritt, In re, 992 S.W.2d 444 (Tex. 1999), the court explained that Rule
18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure requires a trial judge who does not
agree to recusal to refer the matter to the presiding judge of the
administrative judicial district, who then has the authority to hear the
motion or designate another judge to do so. The court clarified that this
authority is derived from Chapter 74 of the Government Code, not merely
from the rules of civil procedure, further highlighting the statutory basis for
the referral requirement.
Additional secondary materials and pretrial motion authorities echo these
principles, consistently stating that a judge faced with a recusal motion must
either recuse themselves or refer the motion to the appropriate presiding
authority for assignment to another judge (Pretrial motions (2022-05-05); 
Pretrial Motions (2021-08-16)).

Analysis
Statutory and Regulatory Requirements
The statutory language of Tex. Gov’t Code § 25.00255 is unequivocal: when a
presiding judge is the subject of a recusal motion, the judge must refer the
motion to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court for assignment of another
judge. This is not a matter of judicial discretion or procedural preference; it
is a mandatory legal requirement. The administrative regulation at 1 Tex.
Admin. Code § 155.152 reinforces this mandate by specifying that if the
presiding judge does not voluntarily recuse or disqualify themselves, the
Chief Judge or their designee must assign another judge to consider and
rule on the motion.
The rationale behind this strict procedural requirement is to ensure
impartiality and maintain public confidence in the judiciary. Allowing a judge
to rule on their own recusal motion would create an appearance of
impropriety and undermine the fairness of the proceedings. The statutory
and regulatory framework is designed to prevent such conflicts of interest
and to guarantee that recusal motions are adjudicated by a neutral and
independent judge.
Judicial Interpretation and Consequences of
Noncompliance
The Texas Supreme Court’s decisions in Gonzalez v. Guilbot and Hudson v.
Texas Children’s Hosp. are directly on point. In both cases, the court held
that the recuse-or-refer procedure is mandatory and that a judge’s failure to
comply with this requirement constitutes a violation of statutory law and due
process. The court in Gonzalez v. Guilbot went further, holding that when a
judge improperly rules on their own recusal motion, all subsequent orders
issued by that judge are void. This is a strong remedy, reflecting the
seriousness with which Texas law treats violations of the recusal referral
process.
The court’s reasoning is grounded in the principle that a judge who is the
subject of a recusal motion cannot be the arbiter of their own impartiality.
The mandatory referral procedure ensures that the question of recusal is
decided by a judge who is not personally implicated in the motion, thereby
safeguarding the integrity of the judicial process.
The decision in Perritt, In re further clarifies that the authority to assign
another judge to hear a recusal motion comes from Chapter 74 of the
Government Code, not merely from procedural rules. This underscores the
statutory nature of the referral requirement and reinforces the conclusion
that noncompliance is a violation of statutory law.
Application to Judge Evans
Applying these authorities to the scenario involving Judge Evans, the
analysis is straightforward. Judge Evans, as the presiding judge and the

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
subject of a recusal motion, was required by Tex. Gov’t Code § 25.00255 to
refer the motion to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court for assignment of
another judge. His failure to do so is a clear violation of the statute and the
corresponding administrative regulation.
Under the Texas Supreme Court’s decisions, this procedural failure is itself
grounds for recusal. Moreover, any orders issued by Judge Evans after the
improper handling of the recusal motion are void and subject to vacatur. The
law does not recognize any exceptions or justifications for a judge’s failure
to comply with the mandatory referral procedure in this context.
Due Process Considerations
The mandatory referral procedure is not merely a technical requirement; it
is a fundamental component of due process in the adjudication of recusal
motions. By ensuring that recusal motions are heard by a neutral judge, the
law protects the parties’ right to a fair and impartial tribunal. A judge’s
failure to follow this procedure deprives the parties of this right and
undermines the legitimacy of the judicial process.
The Texas Supreme Court’s decisions make clear that due process is
violated when a judge who is the subject of a recusal motion fails to refer
the motion as required by law. The remedy for such a violation is the recusal
of the judge and the invalidation of any orders issued in violation of the
statute.
Supporting Secondary Materials
Secondary materials and pretrial motion authorities consistently reinforce
the statutory and case law requirements. They state that once a sufficient
motion to recuse has been filed, the judge must either recuse themselves or
request the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district to assign
another judge to hear the motion. These materials confirm that the referral
procedure is mandatory and that failure to comply is a violation of statutory
law and due process (Pretrial motions (2022-05-05); Pretrial Motions
(2021-08-16)).
Exceptions and Caveats
The authorities provided do not recognize any exceptions to the mandatory
referral requirement in cases where the presiding judge is the subject of a
recusal motion. The statutory language is clear and unambiguous, and the
Texas Supreme Court has consistently enforced the requirement without
exception. There is no indication in the case law or secondary materials that
a judge may excuse noncompliance with the referral procedure based on
exigent circumstances, harmless error, or any other justification.
It is also important to note that the authorities provided do not indicate any
subsequent negative treatment of the controlling cases. The decisions in 
Gonzalez v. Guilbot, Hudson v. Texas Children’s Hosp., and Perritt, In re

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
remain good law and continue to govern the handling of recusal motions in
Texas statutory probate courts.
Conclusion
In summary, Texas law is unequivocal in requiring that when a presiding
judge is the subject of a recusal motion, the judge must refer the motion to
the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court for assignment of another judge. This
referral procedure is mandatory and is grounded in both statutory law and
due process principles. The Texas Supreme Court has held that a judge’s
failure to comply with this requirement is itself grounds for recusal and
renders any subsequent orders issued by the judge void.
Judge Evans’s failure to follow the mandatory referral procedure under Tex.
Gov’t Code § 25.00255 is a clear violation of statutory law and due process.
As a result, he is subject to recusal, and any orders he issued after the
improper handling of the recusal motion are void and should be vacated.
The authorities provided leave no room for doubt or exception on this point,
and the law is firmly established in favor of strict compliance with the
recusal referral procedure.
Legal Authorities
Perritt, In re, 992 S.W.2d 444 (Tex. 1999)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Rule 18a requires a trial judge who does not agree to recusal to refer the
matter to the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district, who in
turn may hear the motion or designate another judge to do so. TEX.R. CIV. P.
18a(d). When the presiding judge assigns the matter to another judge, he or
she does so under authority as presiding judge of the administrative judicial
district. Chapter 74 of the Government Code furnishes that authority in this
instance, not our rules of civil procedure.
Summary
Rule 18a mandates a trial judge to refer a recusal motion to the presiding
judge of the administrative judicial district if the judge does not agree to
recuse themselves. This referral is a procedural requirement, and the
presiding judge's authority to assign another judge to hear the motion is
derived from Chapter 74 of the Government Code. This supports the
proposition that failure to follow the mandatory referral procedure is a
violation of statutory law.

P. 18a(d). When the presiding judge assigns the matter to another judge, he

Summary
Rule 18a mandates a trial judge who does not agree to recusal to refer the
matter to the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district. This
aligns with the proposition that a presiding judge, when subject to a recusal
motion, must follow a specific referral procedure. The passage also
emphasizes that the authority for assigning another judge comes from
Chapter 74, reinforcing the statutory requirement for proper referral and
assignment.
Gonzalez v. Guilbot, 315 S.W.3d 533 (Tex. 2010)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The court of appeals held that under the general 'recuse or refer' rule in
Government Code section 25.00255(f), a judge against whom a recusal
motion has been filed 'has only two options: grant the motion to recuse or
refer the motion to another judge for a ruling.' Thus, the court concluded,
'Judge Herman erred when he ruled on his own motion to recuse' rather
than referring the motion to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court
pursuant to Government Code section 74.057(a) and Texas Rule of Civil
Procedure 18a(g). 'Because Judge Herman did not have the power to rule on
his own recusal motion,' the court reasoned, 'all subsequent orders he
entered are void.'
Summary
The passage clearly states that under Texas Government Code section
25.00255(f), a judge who is the subject of a recusal motion must either grant
the motion or refer it to another judge. The failure to do so, as in the case of
Judge Herman, results in the orders issued by the judge being void. This
directly supports the proposition that Judge Evans's failure to refer the
recusal motion is a violation of statutory law and due process, and it
provides grounds for recusal and vacating orders.

Hudson v. Texas Children's Hosp., 177 S.W.3d 232 (Tex. 2005)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Once a motion to recuse is filed in statutory probate court, the trial judge
has two options before taking any other action: (1) recuse himself or (2)
request that the presiding judge of the statutory probate courts assign a
judge to hear the motion to recuse. Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 25.00255(f)
(Vernon 2004); TEX.R. CIV. P. 18a(c). The Texas Supreme Court has held that
the recuse or refer procedure is mandatory.
Summary
The passage clearly states that when a motion to recuse is filed, the trial
judge must either recuse themselves or refer the motion to the presiding
judge for assignment to another judge. This is described as a mandatory
procedure under Tex. Gov't Code § 25.00255(f) and Texas Rule of Civil
Procedure 18a(c). The Texas Supreme Court's interpretation underscores
the obligatory nature of this process, which directly supports the proposition
that failure to follow this procedure is a violation of statutory law and due
process.

Disqualification of Judge
Extract
if the presiding judge is the subject of the motion of recusal or
disqualification, shall sign and file with the clerk an order referring the
motion to the chief justice of the supreme court for assignment of a

and rule on the motion, subject to Subdivisions and.
Summary
The passage clearly states that if the presiding judge is the subject of a
recusal motion, they are required to refer the motion to the Chief Justice of
the Supreme Court for assignment of another judge. This is a mandatory
procedure outlined in the statute. Failure to comply with this requirement
would constitute a violation of statutory law, as the statute explicitly
mandates this referral process. Therefore, if Judge Evans did not follow this
procedure, it would be grounds for recusal and could potentially invalidate
any orders issued in violation of the statute.

Summary
The passage clearly outlines the procedure that must be followed if a
presiding judge is the subject of a recusal motion. Specifically, it mandates
that if the presiding judge does not voluntarily disqualify or recuse
themselves, the Chief Judge or their designee must assign another judge to
consider and rule on the motion. This aligns with the proposition that failure
to follow such a procedure is a violation of statutory law and due process, as
it ensures impartiality and fairness in judicial proceedings.

statutory requirement that the motion must be referred to the Chief Justice
of the Supreme Court for assignment of another judge. Failure to follow this
procedure is a violation of statutory law and due process, supporting the
proposition that Judge Evans's failure to do so is grounds for recusal and for
vacating any orders issued in violation of the statute.
