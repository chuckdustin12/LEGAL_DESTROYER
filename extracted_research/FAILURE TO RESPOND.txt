Question
Petitioner has failed to respond to or rebut specific, documented allegations
of financial misconduct and misrepresentation, despite being given notice
and opportunity to do so. Under Texas law, a party’s failure to respond to
material allegations may result in those allegations being deemed admitted,
especially when supported by documentary evidence and not contradicted
by sworn testimony. This failure to engage with the factual record, coupled
with the continued assertion of false claims, reflects a willful disregard for
truth and candor to the court, further evidencing egregious and
sanctionable conduct.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
Under Texas law, a party’s failure to respond to or rebut specific,
documented allegations—particularly when given notice and opportunity—
can result in those allegations being deemed admitted, and such conduct
may support findings of willful disregard for truth and sanctionable
misconduct. Courts routinely treat unrefuted, material allegations as
admitted and may impose severe sanctions, including adverse presumptions,
fee awards, or even striking pleadings, especially where the non-responding
party continues to assert false claims.
Summary
Texas law provides that when a party fails to respond to material,
documented allegations—such as those involving financial misconduct or
misrepresentation—after proper notice and opportunity, those allegations
may be deemed admitted by operation of law. This principle is most clearly
established in the context of requests for admission and default judgments,
but it also extends to broader litigation conduct, where courts may draw
adverse inferences or impose sanctions for willful non-engagement with the
factual record.
The failure to rebut or address such allegations, especially when coupled
with continued assertion of false claims, is treated by Texas courts as
evidence of bad faith, lack of candor, and sanctionable conduct. Courts have
broad authority to impose remedies ranging from adverse evidentiary
presumptions to striking pleadings and awarding attorney’s fees,
particularly where the conduct reflects a pattern of misrepresentation or
obstruction. The legal framework is supported by both procedural rules and
case law, with only limited exceptions where due process or the interests of
justice require otherwise.

Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
Texas procedural law, particularly the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure,
establishes that a party’s failure to respond to requests for admission results
in those matters being deemed admitted. Under Rule 198, if a party does not
timely serve a sworn denial or detailed explanation, the requested facts are
conclusively established for the case (Alejos v. Vance, 08-23-00321-CV (Tex.
App. Sep 04, 2024); Civil Litigation (2022-05-05)). This mechanism is
designed to streamline litigation and prevent parties from evading the
factual record.
Similarly, in administrative disciplinary contexts, such as proceedings before
the Texas Board of Nursing, regulations require respondents to specifically
admit or deny each allegation. Failure to answer after proper notice results
in default, with all factual allegations deemed admitted and sanctions
imposed accordingly (22 Tex. Admin. Code § 213.16). While this is specific to
administrative law, it reflects a broader Texas principle: non-response to
material allegations, after notice and opportunity, leads to deemed
admissions and default sanctions.
Case Law
Texas appellate courts have repeatedly affirmed that failure to respond to
requests for admission or to otherwise rebut material allegations can result
in those allegations being deemed admitted and used as the basis for
dispositive rulings. In Alejos v. Vance, 08-23-00321-CV (Tex. App. Sep 04,
2024), the court held that untimely responses to requests for admission
were properly deemed admitted by operation of law, and the trial court
could rely on those admissions to render judgment. The court further
explained that withdrawal of deemed admissions is only permitted for good
cause, and that merits-preclusive sanctions are generally barred absent
flagrant bad faith or callous disregard for the rules.
In Texaco, Inc. v. Phan, 137 S.W.3d 763 (Tex. App. 2004), the court
recognized that a party’s failure to answer or appear can result in the
material allegations of the petition being treated as admitted, particularly in
the context of default judgments. The court noted, however, that in certain
contexts (such as divorce), proof may still be required despite default, but
outside such exceptions, uncontroverted allegations—especially those
involving misrepresentation—may be taken as admitted.
The principle extends beyond requests for admission and default judgments.
In Darnell v. Broberg, 565 S.W.3d 450 (Tex. App. 2018), the court found that
a party’s failure to object to or rebut unsworn statements allowed those
statements to be treated as evidence refuting the party’s allegations. The
court concluded that the party’s refusal to justify his allegations, despite
contrary evidence, supported sanctions for filing pleadings without
evidentiary support and for repeated misrepresentations.

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Similarly, in Zenergy, Inc., In re, 968 S.W.2d 1 (Tex. App. 1997), the court
affirmed severe sanctions, including striking pleadings, where parties
intentionally withheld material evidence, misrepresented compliance with
discovery, and gave false testimony. The court held that such conduct
justified presumptions against the parties’ claims and supported the
imposition of sanctions for willful disregard of truth and candor.
Other cases reinforce these principles. In CherCo Properties, Inc. v. Law,
Snakard & Gambill, P.C., 985 S.W.2d 262 (Tex. App. 1999), the court
explained that Texas law requires specific, substantive responses to requests
for admission, and that evasive or inadequate responses can trigger
sufficiency challenges and sanctions. In Contico Intern., Inc. v. Alvarez, 910
S.W.2d 29 (Tex. App. 1995), the court linked failure to respond to serious
allegations with professional misconduct and emphasized that sanctions are
mandatory to deter such conduct. However, it is important to note that 
Contico Intern., Inc. v. Alvarez was overruled on other grounds by a North
Carolina case (State v. Linney, 138 N.C. App. 169, 531 S.E.2d 245 (N.C. App.
2000)), but the overruling does not affect its discussion of Texas law
regarding sanctions for non-responsiveness and misrepresentation.
Administrative Decisions
Administrative decisions, while not binding, provide persuasive support for
the principle that failure to respond to requests for admission results in
those matters being deemed admitted, unless excusable neglect is shown or
a motion to withdraw is filed (Armida Winery Inc. v. Cuban, LLC, 080118
USTTAB, 92065105 (2018-08-01)). This mirrors Texas law and underscores
the expectation that parties must engage with the factual record or face
adverse consequences.
Secondary Materials
Secondary materials are not directly cited here, as the primary and case law
authorities sufficiently establish the relevant principles.
Analysis
Deemed Admissions and Adverse Inferences
Texas law is clear that a party’s failure to respond to requests for admission,
or to otherwise rebut material, documented allegations, results in those
matters being deemed admitted. This is codified in the Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure and confirmed by appellate decisions. The deemed admission is
not merely procedural; it has substantive effect, allowing courts to treat the
admitted facts as conclusively established for purposes of summary
judgment or trial (Alejos v. Vance, 08-23-00321-CV (Tex. App. Sep 04, 2024);
Civil Litigation (2022-05-05)).
The rationale is to prevent parties from evading the factual record and to
promote judicial efficiency. When a party is given notice and opportunity to
respond, but fails to do so, the law presumes the truth of the unrefuted

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
allegations. This is particularly compelling when the allegations are
supported by documentary evidence and not contradicted by sworn
testimony (Texaco, Inc. v. Phan, 137 S.W.3d 763 (Tex. App. 2004)).
The principle also applies outside the context of formal requests for
admission. When serious factual allegations are made in a party’s presence
and circumstances call for a reply, a total or partial failure to respond
permits the court to presume the truth of those allegations (Evidence
(2022-05-05)). This adverse inference is especially strong where the non-
responding party continues to assert false claims or misrepresentations, as
it evidences a willful disregard for truth and candor.
Sanctionable Conduct
Texas courts have broad authority to impose sanctions for conduct that
reflects bad faith, obstruction, or lack of candor. Sanctions may include
adverse evidentiary presumptions, fee awards, striking of pleadings, or even
dismissal of claims (Zenergy, Inc., In re, 968 S.W.2d 1 (Tex. App. 1997); 
Darnell v. Broberg, 565 S.W.3d 450 (Tex. App. 2018)). The courts look to the
totality of the conduct, including repeated misrepresentations, filing of
frivolous pleadings, and direct disobedience of court orders.
In Zenergy, Inc., In re, the court upheld severe sanctions where parties
withheld material evidence, misrepresented compliance, and gave false
testimony. The court reasoned that such conduct justified presumptions
against the parties’ claims and supported the imposition of sanctions for
willful disregard of truth and candor. Similarly, in Darnell v. Broberg, the
court found that a party’s refusal to justify allegations, despite contrary
evidence, supported sanctions for filing unsupported pleadings and for
repeated misrepresentations.
The ethical dimension is also significant. Texas Disciplinary Rule of
Professional Conduct 8.04 prohibits conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,
deceit, or misrepresentation, and authorizes sanctions for such conduct
(Contico Intern., Inc. v. Alvarez, 910 S.W.2d 29 (Tex. App. 1995)). Although 
Contico Intern., Inc. v. Alvarez was overruled on other grounds by a North
Carolina case, its discussion of Texas law regarding sanctions for non-
responsiveness and misrepresentation remains persuasive.
Procedural Safeguards and Withdrawal of Admissions
While the law is strict regarding deemed admissions, Texas courts recognize
that due process requires some flexibility. A party may seek to withdraw
deemed admissions by showing good cause, such as accidental failure to
answer rather than intentional or conscious indifference (Alejos v. Vance,
08-23-00321-CV (Tex. App. Sep 04, 2024); Wheeler v. Green, 157 S.W.3d 439
(Tex. 2005)). However, withdrawal is generally not permitted where the
failure to respond is the result of bad faith or callous disregard for the rules.
The Texas Supreme Court in Wheeler v. Green, 157 S.W.3d 439 (Tex. 2005)
emphasized that trial courts have broad discretion to permit or deny
withdrawal of deemed admissions, but must do so in accordance with

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
guiding rules and principles. The court also noted that merits-preclusive
sanctions are generally barred absent flagrant bad faith or callous
disregard, ensuring that cases are not decided on technicalities where the
interests of justice require otherwise. However, this does not undermine the
core principle that failure to respond to material allegations, after notice
and opportunity, results in those allegations being deemed admitted and
may support sanctions.
Application to Financial Misconduct and Misrepresentation
The principles outlined above apply with particular force to allegations of
financial misconduct and misrepresentation. Where a party is accused of
such conduct and fails to respond or rebut the allegations—especially when
the allegations are supported by documentary evidence and not contradicted
by sworn testimony—the court may deem the allegations admitted and
impose sanctions.
In Texaco, Inc. v. Phan, the court treated fraud allegations as admitted due
to the party’s failure to respond, supporting the proposition that non-
response results in deemed admissions of material allegations, including
those involving misrepresentation. In Darnell v. Broberg, the court found
that repeated misrepresentations and failure to confront the factual record
justified fee sanctions and a finding that the pleadings were unsupported.
The failure to engage with the factual record, coupled with continued
assertion of false claims, is treated as willful disregard for truth and candor.
Courts have not hesitated to impose severe sanctions in such circumstances,
including striking pleadings and awarding attorney’s fees (Zenergy, Inc., In
re).
Exceptions and Caveats
There are limited exceptions to the general rule that failure to respond
results in deemed admissions. Texas courts recognize that due process may
require withdrawal of deemed admissions where the failure to respond was
accidental or where merits-preclusive sanctions would be unjust (Wheeler v.
Green, 157 S.W.3d 439 (Tex. 2005)). However, these exceptions do not apply
where the failure to respond is the result of bad faith, callous disregard, or a
pattern of misrepresentation.
Additionally, in certain contexts—such as divorce proceedings—proof may
still be required notwithstanding default or deemed admissions (Texaco, Inc.
v. Phan, 137 S.W.3d 763 (Tex. App. 2004)). Outside such exceptions, the
general rule applies.
It is also important to note that while Contico Intern., Inc. v. Alvarez was
overruled on other grounds by a North Carolina case, its discussion of Texas
law regarding sanctions for non-responsiveness and misrepresentation
remains persuasive and is consistent with other Texas authorities.

Conclusion
Texas law is unequivocal that a party’s failure to respond to or rebut
specific, documented allegations—after proper notice and opportunity—
results in those allegations being deemed admitted, particularly when
supported by documentary evidence and not contradicted by sworn
testimony. This principle is enforced through procedural rules, case law, and
ethical standards, and courts have broad authority to impose sanctions for
willful disregard of truth and candor. The failure to engage with the factual
record, especially when coupled with continued assertion of false claims, is
treated as egregious and sanctionable conduct, justifying adverse
presumptions, fee awards, and even striking of pleadings. Only in limited
circumstances—such as accidental failure to respond or where due process
requires—will courts permit withdrawal of deemed admissions or decline to
impose sanctions. The legal framework is robust and well-supported by both
procedural and substantive authorities.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The Owners' allegations in their petition, which allegations are now deemed
admitted by Texaco, stated that Texaco made the representations with
knowledge of their falsity. Therefore, the Owners sufficiently pleaded their
fraud claim. See id." ... "See id. (holding that, as general rule, no evidence is
required to support default judgment... respondent's failure to answer or to
appear is taken as admission of allegations in petition relating only to
residence and domicile and ... petitioner must adduce proof to support
material allegations in petition).
Summary
The court recognizes that when a party fails to respond, the material
allegations in the petition can be deemed admitted. Here, the court treated
the fraud allegations (including knowledge of falsity) as admitted due to
Texaco’s failure, supporting the proposition that non-response results in
deemed admissions of material allegations. The case also acknowledges
contexts where proof remains necessary, reinforcing that, outside such
exceptions, uncontroverted allegations—especially of misrepresentation—
may be taken as admitted.

Extract
Although Darnell complained that Zimprich’s statements were self-serving,
he did not make a timely objection to his unsworn testimony. Instead,
Darnell argued he did not need to justify his allegations nor could he do so
at that time. Failing to object, Darnell waived the oath requirement and
Zimprich’s statements qualify as evidence that the factual allegations in the
third-party petition were false. ... Therefore, we conclude that there was
sufficient evidence for the trial court to hold that the factual statements
made in the third-party petition were patently false, and without any
evidentiary basis. ... Here, the record clearly supports a finding that Darnell
violated Chapter 10 when he filed the third-party petition. His own client’s
testimony demonstrated that had Darnell made inquiry by asking his own
clients, he would have learned that the factual allegations contained in the
petition had no evidentiary support. ... The record contains evidence that
Darnell engaged in repeated instances of sanctionable conduct in the trial
court—repeated misrepresentations, filing of frivolous pleadings, and
directly disobeying a court order...
Summary
The court held that (1) by failing to object, Darnell allowed unsworn
statements to be treated as evidence refuting his allegations; (2) sworn
testimony later in the record expressly contradicted his claims, rendering
them patently false and unsupported; (3) his stance that he need not justify
allegations, despite contrary evidence, supported sanctions under Chapter
10; and (4) repeated misrepresentations and frivolous filings justified fee
sanctions. This aligns with the proposition that ignoring and failing to rebut
specific factual showings—particularly when supported by testimony or
documentation—permits the court to accept those showings, deem pleadings
unsupported, and sanction willful disregard for truth and candor.

Texas Supreme Court
Extract
We recognize that trial courts have broad discretion to permit or deny
withdrawal of deemed admissions, but they cannot do so arbitrarily,
unreasonably, or without reference to guiding rules or principles. ... While
requests for admissions were at one time unique in including an automatic
sanction for untimely responses, failure to comply with any discovery
requests now bears similar consequences. See Tex.R. Civ. P. 193.6(a).
Nevertheless, we have held for all other forms of discovery that absent
flagrant bad faith or callous disregard for the rules, due process bars merits-
preclusive sanctions, and have applied this rule to: • depositions, see
TransAmerican Natural Gas Corp. v. Powell, 811 S.W.2d 913, 918-19 (Tex.
1991); ... The rule governing admissions includes as part of the undue-
prejudice inquiry that the 'presentation of the merits [must] be subserved'

by permitting withdrawal. Tex.R. Civ. P. 198.3(b). The two are different sides
of the same coin, as presentation of the merits will suffer (1) if the
requesting party cannot prepare for trial, and also (2) if the requestor can
prepare but the case is decided on deemed (but perhaps untrue) facts
anyway.
Summary
The passage confirms that failure to timely respond to requests for
admissions can result in deemed admissions and that noncompliance with
discovery carries consequences, supporting the premise that unresponded
material allegations may be treated as admitted. It also frames when
withdrawal should be allowed, highlighting that cases may be decided on
deemed facts if unchallenged, aligning with the notion that failure to rebut
supported allegations can be outcome-determinative. The discussion of due
process limits on merits-preclusive sanctions tempers the argument but does
not negate the core point that deemed admissions arise from failure to
respond and can control absent withdrawal.

Neither do the Rules address a lawyer's failure to respond to such squarely
leveled allegations. Rule 8.04, however, expresses the noble ethos of the
profession by proscribing a variety of unseemly conduct. The Rule prevents
a lawyer from directly or vicariously violating other disciplinary rules, from
committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on one's honesty,
trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer, from engaging in conduct that
involves dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation, and from engaging
in conduct that constitutes obstruction of justice. TEX. DISCIPLINARY R.
PROF. CONDUCT 8.04 (1994)." ... "Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 215
provides for the imposition of sanctions on parties who abuse the discovery
process." ... "we recently held that Rule 215 is broad enough to allow for the
sanctioning of lawyers who engage in trickery and deceit in the course of
representing a client... 'Sanctions imposed to deter such abominable
conduct are not only permissible, they are mandatory.'
Summary
The court notes a "failure to respond to such squarely leveled allegations"
and ties such non-responsiveness to professional misconduct under Rule
8.04 (dishonesty, fraud, misrepresentation, obstruction). It further
underscores that Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 215 authorizes sanctions for
abuse, including deceit and obstruction, with sanctions deemed mandatory
to deter such conduct. This supports the proposition that failure to engage
with and rebut documented allegations—particularly when coupled with

misrepresentation—reflects willful disregard for truth and is sanctionable
under Texas law.

Extract
Rule 169 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure sets forth the response that
may be given to a request for an admission... if a party does not admit a
matter, it must specifically deny the matter, or set forth in detail the reasons
that the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny the matter... a
party may not give lack of information or knowledge as a reason for failure
to admit or deny unless it states that it has made reasonable inquiry... The
rule also provides that the requesting party may move to determine the
sufficiency of the responding party's answers, and that expenses incurred in
relation to such a motion may be awarded in accordance with Rule 215.3...
Under Rule 215.3 if the trial court determines that a party's response or
answer in the discovery process is unreasonably frivolous or made for the
purposes of delay, the court may impose any appropriate sanction, including
attorney's fees.
Summary
The passages establish that Texas law requires specific, substantive
responses to requests for admissions; non-answers or evasive answers are
insufficient and sanctionable. While the excerpt does not expressly say
“deemed admissions,” it underscores that inadequate responses can trigger
sufficiency challenges and sanctions under Rule 215.3, supporting the
proposition that failure to engage with material allegations in discovery is
sanctionable misconduct. This aligns with the broader point that ignoring or
failing to rebut documented allegations can have adverse procedural
consequences and evidences disregard for candor.

After the Alejoses apparently faxed their responses 29 minutes late, the trial

instead relied on the deemed admissions in rendering judgment for Vance. ...

when the deemed admissions act as a merits-preclusive sanction, unless the
trial court finds the party seeking withdrawal acted in bad faith or with
callous disregard. ... '[A]bsent flagrant bad faith or callous disregard for the
rules, due process bars merits-preclusive sanctions.'
Summary
The passages confirm that under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 198, failure
to timely respond to requests for admission results in the matters being
deemed admitted by operation of law and can be relied upon to render
judgment. This directly supports the proposition that a party’s failure to
respond to material allegations can result in those allegations being treated
as admitted, especially when used to support summary judgment. The
opinion also frames the standards for withdrawing deemed admissions and
references bad faith/callous disregard, which aligns with arguments about
willful disregard and sanctionable conduct when the failure is not excused.

Extract
Judge Evins concluded that a direct relationship existed between the
sanctions imposed and the offensive conduct of relators. He reasoned (1)
that relators intentionally withheld material evidence in response to valid
discovery requests while misrepresenting to the court and Neuhaus that
these same requests had been fully answered; (2) that relators filed a
Motion for Summary Judgment on the very issues which were affected by
the withheld information; and (3) that relators gave false testimony
concerning their failure to comply with discovery requests... • Plaintiffs and
their Austin Counsel deliberately withheld relevant information...
• ...misrepresented their compliance to the court and Neuhaus. • ...The
record reflects that Davidson stated no such documentation exists. Thus, the
claim appears to be a fabrication. • ...represented in open court, in filed
motions, depositions, and correspondence with Neuhaus that the
interrogatory answers were true and complete. • Austin counsel knew and
participated in plaintiffs' incomplete and knowingly false interrogatory and
discovery answers. In addition, counsel made deliberate misrepresentations
to the court concerning the completeness and accuracy of the discovery
responses... The sanctions order also states that 'false testimony, refusal to
comply with the Court's orders, obstruction of the discovery process and
failure to provide any evidence of actual damages ... justifies the
presumption that their claims lack merit.' As a result, Judge Evins struck
plaintiffs' pleadings.

Summary
The court affirmed severe sanctions, including striking pleadings, based on
parties’ failure to provide and rebut material, documented information,
misrepresentations about discovery compliance, and false testimony—
conduct evidencing willful disregard for truth and candor. The opinion
recognizes presumptions against a party’s claims where they obstruct
discovery and provide no supporting documentation.

Summary
Texas administrative procedure for Board of Nursing discipline requires a
respondent to answer and specifically admit/deny allegations. Failure to
respond after proper notice results in default, with all factual allegations
deemed admitted and sanctions imposed accordingly. This supports the
proposition that under Texas law, failure to respond to material allegations
can lead to those allegations being deemed admitted, particularly when
proper notice is given and no sworn rebuttal is offered. While limited to the
Board of Nursing context, it exemplifies Texas’s broader legal consequence
for non-response: deemed admissions and default sanctions, reinforcing
arguments about willful disregard and sanctionable conduct when parties
ignore the factual record.

Summary
The Texas case excerpt shows that when serious factual allegations are
made and understood, and the circumstances call for a reply, a party’s total
or partial failure to reply permits a presumption against that party. This
supports arguing that unrefuted, documented allegations may be treated as
admitted or give rise to adverse inferences, and that refusal to engage with
the record can evidence sanctionable misconduct.

admitted unless a sworn statement is delivered to the party or the party’s
attorney requesting these admissions within 30 days after delivery of these
requests, either denying specifically the matters of which an admission is
requested or setting forth in detail the reasons the party cannot truthfully
either admit or deny these matters.
Summary
The quoted passage establishes that failure to timely respond with a sworn
denial or explanation results in deemed admissions of the requested factual
matters. This directly supports the proposition that a party’s failure to
respond to material, documented allegations (e.g., financial misconduct
supported by exhibits) may result in those facts being deemed admitted.

Summary
When a party fails to respond to requests for admission and does not move
to withdraw or show excusable neglect, the matters are deemed admitted.
This supports the proposition’s core point that non-response to material
allegations can be treated as admissions. While the forum is TTAB and cites
Fed. R. Civ. P. 36, Texas has an analogous rule (Tex. R. Civ. P. 198) and
similar case law treating unanswered requests as deemed admissions,
supporting the proposition’s Texas-law framing. The passage also
underscores willful non-engagement with the record.
