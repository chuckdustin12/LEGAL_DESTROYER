Question
What claims can be made in federal court under diversity jurisdiction if a
victim sues a perpetrator for $90,000 in damages, alleging that the
perpetrator facilitated fraudulent divorce paperwork, made false statements
leading to deprivation of children, home, and business, and transferred
$1,576 through PayPal?
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
A victim can sue in federal court under diversity jurisdiction for state law
claims like fraud, misrepresentation, or intentional infliction of emotional
distress as the $90,000 damages sought exceeds the $75,000 threshold
required by 28 U.S.C. § 1332, provided the parties are citizens of different
states. The specific state law claims available will depend on the substantive
law of the relevant state jurisdiction.
Summary
Diversity jurisdiction allows federal courts to hear state law claims when the
amount in controversy exceeds $75,000 and there is complete diversity of
citizenship between the parties, meaning no plaintiff is a citizen of the same
state as any defendant. In this case, the victim's claim for $90,000 in
damages meets the amount in controversy requirement under 28 U.S.C. §
1332. If the victim and perpetrator are citizens of different states, the
federal court would have subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case.
The allegations involving fraudulent divorce paperwork, false statements
leading to deprivation of children, home, and business, and the unauthorized
transfer of funds through PayPal could potentially give rise to several state
law claims. These might include common law fraud, misrepresentation,
intentional infliction of emotional distress, conversion (for the PayPal funds),
and potentially other tort claims depending on the specific facts and the
applicable state law. The federal court would apply the substantive law of
the relevant state while following federal procedural rules.
Background and Relevant Legislation
The cornerstone of diversity jurisdiction in federal courts is 28 U.S.C. §
1332. This statute provides federal district courts with original jurisdiction
over civil actions where the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000,
exclusive of interest and costs, and is between citizens of different states.
According to 28 U.S.C. § 1332, "The district courts shall have original
jurisdiction of all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds the
sum or value of $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and is between—

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
citizens of different States; citizens of a State and citizens or subjects of a
foreign state, except that the district courts shall not have original
jurisdiction under this subsection of an action between citizens of a State
and citizens or subjects of a foreign state who are lawfully admitted for
permanent residence in the United States and are domiciled in the same
State."
This federal statute establishes two primary requirements for diversity
jurisdiction:
The amount in controversy must exceed $75,000, exclusive of interest
and costs.
The parties must be citizens of different states, establishing what
courts refer to as "complete diversity."
Case Law on Federal Diversity Jurisdiction
Amount in Controversy Requirement
The case law consistently confirms that for federal diversity jurisdiction to
exist, the amount in controversy must exceed $75,000, exclusive of interest
and costs.
In Roberts v. Moline Hous. Auth. (C.D. Ill. 2024), the court stated: "District
courts have diversity jurisdiction over civil actions where the amount in
controversy exceeds $75,000 and the suit is between citizens of different
states." This reaffirms the statutory requirement and its continuing
application in current jurisprudence.
Similarly, Beck v. Am. Honda Fin. Corp., Civil Action No. 19-cv-02712-PAB-
MEH (D. Colo. Jun 09, 2020) notes: "Pursuant to § 1332, 'district courts shall
have original jurisdiction of all civil actions where the matter in controversy
exceeds the sum or value of $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and is
between... citizens of different States.'"
Kamensky v. Estate of Weinstein, Case No. 10-cv-6605 (N.D. Ill. May 13,
2011) further emphasizes this point, stating: "Congress has provided that
'[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions where
the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $75,000 exclusive of
interests and costs' and where the action is between 'citizens of different
states.'"
In the scenario presented, the victim is seeking $90,000 in damages, which
clearly exceeds the statutory threshold of $75,000. Therefore, the amount in
controversy requirement for diversity jurisdiction would be satisfied.
Complete Diversity Requirement
The case law also consistently emphasizes the requirement of "complete
diversity" between the parties.

McIver v. Murray, 20-CV-10538 (LLS) (S.D. N.Y. Feb 05, 2021) explains:
"Under 28 U.S.C. § 1332, a case in which a citizen of one State sues a citizen
of another State or nation, and the amount in controversy is more than
$75,000, is a diversity case. In a diversity case, no defendant may be a
citizen of the same State as any plaintiff."
Beck v. Am. Honda Fin. Corp., Civil Action No. 19-cv-02712-PAB-MEH (D.
Colo. Jun 09, 2020) elaborates on this requirement: "Thus, 'diversity
jurisdiction exists only if no plaintiff and no defendant are citizens of the
same state—that is, there must be 'complete diversity between all plaintiffs
and all defendants.'' Middleton v. Stephenson, 749 F.3d 1197, 1200 (10th
Cir. 2014) (quoting Lincoln Prop. Co. v. Roche, 546 U.S. 81, 89 (2005))."
Nguyen v. Sound Solutions Grp., Inc., Case No. 18-cv-02225-BLF (N.D. Cal.
Jul 30, 2018) also notes: "Diversity jurisdiction requires 'complete diversity,'
that 'plaintiffs and each defendant be citizens of different states.' Allen v.
Boeing Co., 821 F.3d 1111, 1115 (9th Cir. 2016)."
For the scenario presented, complete diversity would exist if the victim and
the perpetrator are citizens of different states. Without specific information
about their citizenship, we cannot definitively state whether this
requirement is met. However, if they are citizens of different states, this
requirement would be satisfied.
Burden of Proof
It's important to note that the party invoking federal diversity jurisdiction
bears the burden of establishing that jurisdiction exists.
Beck v. Am. Honda Fin. Corp., Civil Action No. 19-cv-02712-PAB-MEH (D.
Colo. Jun 09, 2020) states: "'[A] party invoking diversity jurisdiction bears
the burden of proving its existence by a preponderance of the evidence.' Id."
Similarly, Marchese v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 917 F. Supp. 2d 452 (D.
Md. 2013) notes: "The removing party has the burden of proving the
existence of federal jurisdiction."
In the given scenario, if the victim files the lawsuit in federal court based on
diversity jurisdiction, they would bear the burden of proving that complete
diversity exists between the parties and that the amount in controversy
exceeds $75,000.
Administrative Decisions and Secondary
Materials on Pleading Requirements
Administrative decisions and secondary materials provide additional
guidance on the requirements for properly pleading diversity jurisdiction in
federal court.
H. Rept. 115-17 - Innocent Party Protection Act, 2017-02-24 defines diversity
jurisdiction as "the jurisdiction of Federal courts over cases where the

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
underlying claims arise solely under state law, but the parties are citizens of
different states. A plaintiff may file a case in Federal court on diversity
grounds or a defendant may remove a case filed in state court to Federal
court on such basis."
According to Pleading (2023-05-01), "In order to properly plead diversity
jurisdiction, the plaintiff must: (1) identify the citizenship of each party to
demonstrate that there is indeed diversity; and (2) allege that the amount in
controversy exceeds $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs. Additionally,
the plaintiff must indicate that diversity jurisdiction is based on the federal
statute authorizing diversity jurisdiction—28 U.S.C. §1332."
For the victim in our scenario, this means that when filing the complaint in
federal court, they must clearly identify their own citizenship and the
citizenship of the perpetrator to establish complete diversity, explicitly state
that the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000 (which would be satisfied
by the $90,000 claim), and cite 28 U.S.C. §1332 as the basis for federal
jurisdiction.
Analysis of Potential State Law Claims
Since diversity jurisdiction allows federal courts to hear state law claims
when the jurisdictional requirements are met, we need to analyze what state
law claims might arise from the victim's allegations. The federal court would
apply the substantive law of the relevant state while following federal
procedural rules.
Fraud Claims
Roberts v. Moline Hous. Auth. (C.D. Ill. 2024) clarifies that "fraud is a state
law claim" and cites examples of the elements for common law fraud from
Illinois law: "See, e.g., Connick v. Suzuki Motor Co., 675 N.E.2d 584, 591 (Ill.
1996) (stating the elements for common law fraud)." The court also notes
that common law fraud is "a traditional area of state regulation."
Based on the facts presented, the victim could potentially bring a fraud
claim against the perpetrator for facilitating fraudulent divorce paperwork
and making false statements that led to deprivation of children, home, and
business. While the specific elements of fraud vary by state, they typically
include:
A false statement of material fact
Knowledge by the defendant that the statement was false
Intent to induce the plaintiff to act
Reliance by the plaintiff
Damages resulting from that reliance
The allegation that the perpetrator facilitated fraudulent divorce paperwork
and made false statements suggests potential misrepresentation of material
facts. If the victim relied on these misrepresentations to their detriment,
resulting in the loss of children, home, and business, a fraud claim might be
appropriate.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Misrepresentation Claims
Closely related to fraud are claims for negligent or intentional
misrepresentation. The allegations that the perpetrator made false
statements leading to deprivation of children, home, and business could
potentially support such claims.
Intentional misrepresentation generally requires showing:
A false representation
Made with knowledge of its falsity or reckless disregard for the truth
Made with the intent to induce reliance
Actual reliance by the plaintiff
Resulting damages
Negligent misrepresentation typically requires:
A false representation made without reasonable basis for believing it to
be true
Made in the course of business or a transaction in which the defendant
has a pecuniary interest
Justifiable reliance by the plaintiff
Resulting damages
Given the allegation that the perpetrator made false statements leading to
significant losses for the victim, these claims might be appropriate
depending on the specific facts and applicable state law.
Conversion Claims
For the unauthorized transfer of $1,576 through PayPal, the victim could
potentially bring a conversion claim. Conversion is generally defined as the
wrongful exercise of dominion and control over another's personal property
in denial of or inconsistent with their rights in that property.
If the perpetrator transferred funds from the victim's PayPal account without
authorization, or induced the victim to make the transfer through fraud or
misrepresentation, this could potentially constitute conversion under state
law.
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
Depending on the specific facts and circumstances, the victim might also
have a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED). This tort
generally requires:
Extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant
The defendant's intention to cause, or reckless disregard of the
probability of causing, emotional distress
Severe emotional distress suffered by the plaintiff
Actual and proximate causation

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
If the perpetrator's actions in facilitating fraudulent divorce paperwork and
making false statements that led to the victim's loss of children, home, and
business were sufficiently extreme and outrageous, and caused severe
emotional distress, an IIED claim might be appropriate.
Other Potential Claims
Depending on the specific facts and circumstances, and the applicable state
law, other potential claims might include:
Tortious interference with family relations
Civil conspiracy
Unjust enrichment
Breach of fiduciary duty (if a fiduciary relationship existed)
The availability and elements of these claims would depend on the
substantive law of the relevant state and the specific facts of the case.
Geographical Scope of Claims
It's important to note that the victim's claim must be brought in the proper
federal district court. Under 28 U.S.C. § 1391, which governs venue in
federal courts, a civil action may be brought in:
A judicial district in which any defendant resides, if all defendants are
residents of the State in which the district is located;
A judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions
giving rise to the claim occurred; or
If there is no district in which an action may otherwise be brought, any
judicial district in which any defendant is subject to the court's
personal jurisdiction.
Given the facts provided, the most appropriate venue would likely be the
federal district court in which a substantial part of the events giving rise to
the claim occurred, which would likely be where the fraudulent divorce
paperwork was facilitated or where the false statements were made.
Limitations and Challenges
Proving Damages
While the victim is claiming $90,000 in damages, they will need to provide
sufficient evidence to support this amount. This could include financial
records, property valuations, and other documentation demonstrating the
losses incurred as a result of the perpetrator's actions.
Statute of Limitations
State law claims are subject to statutes of limitations, which vary by state
and by type of claim. The victim would need to ensure that their claims are
• 
• 
• 
• 
1. 
2.

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
brought within the applicable limitations period, which typically begins
running from the date the cause of action accrued or, in some cases, from
when the victim discovered or should have discovered the fraud or other
wrongful conduct.
Jurisdiction Over Children
It's important to note that federal courts generally lack jurisdiction over
domestic relations matters, including child custody disputes. This is known
as the "domestic relations exception" to federal jurisdiction. While the victim
can seek damages for the deprivation of children, the federal court would
not have jurisdiction to make or modify child custody determinations.
As noted in Roberts v. Moline Hous. Auth. (C.D. Ill. 2024), federal courts
have jurisdiction primarily over "those in which a plaintiff alleges a violation
of his rights under the Constitution or federal law (federal question
jurisdiction); and (2) those in which a citizen of one state alleges a violation
of his rights established under state law by a citizen of another state where
the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000 (diversity jurisdiction)."
Proving Fraud
Fraud claims typically must be pleaded with particularity under Rule 9(b) of
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. This means the victim would need to
state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud, including the
time, place, and content of the false representations, as well as the identity
of the person making the misrepresentation and what they obtained thereby.
Conclusion
Based on the provided materials, a victim can bring state law claims in
federal court under diversity jurisdiction if:
The amount in controversy exceeds $75,000 (which is satisfied by the
$90,000 damages claim);
The parties are citizens of different states (complete diversity exists);
and
The claims are properly pleaded in accordance with federal procedural
rules.
The specific state law claims available would depend on the substantive law
of the relevant state, but could potentially include:
Fraud related to the facilitation of fraudulent divorce paperwork and
false statements;
Misrepresentation (intentional or negligent) based on the false
statements;
Conversion for the unauthorized transfer of funds through PayPal;
Intentional infliction of emotional distress; and

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Other potential claims such as tortious interference with family
relations, civil conspiracy, unjust enrichment, or breach of fiduciary
duty, depending on the specific facts and applicable state law.
The victim would need to file their complaint in the appropriate federal
district court, pleading diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332 and
clearly identifying the citizenship of each party to establish complete
diversity. They would also need to ensure that their claims are brought
within the applicable statutes of limitations and that any fraud claims are
pleaded with particularity as required by Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure.
While federal courts can hear these state law claims under diversity
jurisdiction, they generally cannot make or modify child custody
determinations due to the domestic relations exception to federal
jurisdiction. The victim can seek damages for the deprivation of children,
but any actual custody matters would need to be addressed in state court.
Legal Authorities
Marchese v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 917 F. Supp. 2d 452 (D. Md. 2013)
U.S. District Court — District of Maryland
Extract
Federal courts have removal jurisdiction over state court actions “of which
the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction.” 28 U.S.C.
§ 1441(a) (2012). A district court has original jurisdiction over civil claims
arising under federal law, 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (2012); over civil actions where
the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000, exclusive of interests and costs,
and there is complete diversity of citizenship, 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a) (2012);
and over actions where the “putative state law claim has been totally
subsumed by federal law,” Barbour v. Int'l Union, 594 F.3d 315, 326 (4th Cir.
2010), abrogated on other grounds by28 U.S.C. § 1446(b)(2)(B) (2012). The
removing party has the burden of proving the existence of federal
jurisdiction.
Summary
Conditions under which federal courts have jurisdiction over civil actions,
specifically highlighting diversity jurisdiction. It states that a district court
has original jurisdiction over civil actions where the amount in controversy
exceeds $75,000 and there is complete diversity of citizenship. In the given
scenario, the victim is suing for $90,000, which satisfies the amount in
controversy requirement. If there is complete diversity of citizenship
between the parties, the federal court would have jurisdiction under 28
U.S.C. § 1332(a).

Under federal law, district courts are of limited jurisdiction and only have
the power to adjudicate cases that have either “federal question
jurisdiction” or “diversity jurisdiction.” 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1332(a). To have
diversity jurisdiction, the claimant must demonstrate that there is complete
diversity of citizenship between the parties and the amount in controversy
exceeds $75,000. 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a).

Jul 30, 2018)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of California
Extract
Turning to the whether there is diversity jurisdiction, the complaint must
allege that the matter in controversy is between citizens of different states
and the amount in controversy must exceed $75,000 to invoke diversity
jurisdiction in an action involving U.S. citizens. 28 U.S.C. §1332(a)(1).
Diversity jurisdiction requires 'complete diversity,' that 'plaintiffs and each
defendant be citizens of different states.' Allen v. Boeing Co., 821 F.3d 1111,
1115 (9th Cir. 2016).
Summary
For a claim to be made under diversity jurisdiction in federal court, the
matter must involve citizens of different states, and the amount in
controversy must exceed $75,000. The passage also emphasizes the
requirement of "complete diversity," meaning that all plaintiffs must be
citizens of different states from all defendants.

U.S. District Court — Southern District of New York

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
While Plaintiff invoked the Court's federal question jurisdiction, in its April
19, 2019 order, the Court construed Plaintiff's claims as brought under state
law under the Court's diversity jurisdiction. (ECF 7, p. 3.) The Court noted
that the parties were likely diverse - that Plaintiff is a citizen of New York
and Wells Fargo is probably a citizen of South Dakota. (Id. p. 4.) But it also
noted that it was unclear from the original complaint whether Plaintiff had
alleged sufficient facts to satisfy the jurisdictional amount in controversy for
a diversity action - an amount in excess of the sum or value of $75,000.
(Id.) ... The Court specified that Plaintiff had to 'show that she and the
defendant are citizens of different states and that the amount in controversy
exceeds the sum or value of $75,000.00.' (Id.)
Summary
Requirements for a federal court to have diversity jurisdiction over a case.
Specifically, it highlights that for diversity jurisdiction to be applicable, the
parties must be citizens of different states, and the amount in controversy
must exceed $75,000. This is relevant to the question because the victim's
claim of $90,000 in damages meets the amount in controversy requirement,
and if the parties are from different states, the case could potentially be
heard under diversity jurisdiction.
Roberts v. Moline Hous. Auth.
U.S. District Court — Central District of Illinois
Extract
Generally, district courts have the authority to hear two types of cases: (1)
those in which a plaintiff alleges a violation of his rights under the
Constitution or federal law (federal question jurisdiction); and (2) those in
which a citizen of one state alleges a violation of his rights established under
state law by a citizen of another state where the amount in controversy
exceeds $75,000 (diversity jurisdiction). See 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331-1332.
Plaintiff explicitly states that she is bringing suit for fraud, Mot. 1; Am.
Compl. 7, and has disclaimed any reliance on § 1983, Mot. 1. Fraud is a state
law claim. [] See, e.g., Connick v. Suzuki Motor Co., 675 N.E.2d 584, 591 (Ill.
1996) (stating the elements for common law fraud); Trs. of AFTRA Health
Fund v. Biondi, 303 F.3d 765, 775 (7th Cir. 2002) (noting that “common law
fraud[ is] a traditional area of state regulation”). The Court can typically
only hear state law claims if it has diversity jurisdiction over the case.
District courts have diversity jurisdiction over civil actions where the
amount in controversy exceeds $75,000 and the suit is between citizens of
different states.

Summary
Federal courts can hear cases under diversity jurisdiction if the amount in
controversy exceeds $75,000 and the parties are citizens of different states.
The passage also clarifies that fraud is a state law claim, which can be heard
in federal court under diversity jurisdiction if the aforementioned conditions
are met.

Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction (limited power). Generally,
only two types of cases can be heard in federal court: cases involving a
federal question and cases involving diversity of citizenship of the parties.
Under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, a case arising under the United States Constitution
or federal laws or treaties is a federal question case. Under 28 U.S.C. §

For a case to be heard in federal court under diversity jurisdiction, the
parties must be citizens of different states, and the amount in controversy
must exceed $75,000. The passage provides the legal basis for diversity
jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332, which is relevant to the question as it

Summary
Requirements for diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332. It specifies
that for a federal court to have diversity jurisdiction, the amount in
controversy must exceed $75,000, and there must be complete diversity
between the parties, meaning no plaintiff and no defendant can be citizens
of the same state. The party invoking diversity jurisdiction must prove its
existence by a preponderance of the evidence. This is relevant to the
question as it provides the legal basis for determining whether the federal
court can hear the case under diversity jurisdiction.

different states, the federal court would have jurisdiction under diversity
jurisdiction.
