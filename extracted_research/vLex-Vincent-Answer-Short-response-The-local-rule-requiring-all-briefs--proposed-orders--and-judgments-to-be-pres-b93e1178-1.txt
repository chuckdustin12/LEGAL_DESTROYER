Question
Answer Short response The local rule requiring all briefs, proposed orders,
and judgments to be presented to the Court Coordinator conflicts with the
Texas Rules of Judicial Administration because it imposes a procedural
requirement not authorized by, and potentially inconsistent with, the
Supreme Court’s statewide rules and the statutory framework governing
local court administration. Such a rule may interfere with judicial
independence, the uniformity of court procedures, and the efficient
administration of justice as mandated by the Texas Supreme Court and the
Texas Government Code. Summary The Texas Rules of Judicial
Administration, promulgated under the authority of the Texas Supreme
Court and the Texas Government Code, establish a comprehensive
framework for the uniform and efficient operation of courts statewide. These
rules require that local rules, forms, and standing orders must not be
inconsistent with statewide rules or laws, and they emphasize the
importance of judicial independence, fair case management, and the
avoidance of unnecessary procedural barriers. A local rule mandating that
all briefs, proposed orders, and judgments be presented to the Court
Coordinator creates a procedural step not contemplated by the statewide
rules and may impede the judge’s statutory authority to act independently
on matters before the court. This requirement risks undermining the
uniformity and efficiency sought by the Supreme Court’s rules, and if not
properly adopted or if it interferes with the judge’s ability to manage cases,
it is in direct conflict with the governing legal framework for court
administration in Texas. Background and Relevant Law Constitutional and
Statutory Framework The Texas Constitution vests the Supreme Court of
Texas with the responsibility for the efficient administration of the judicial
branch and the authority to promulgate rules of administration necessary for
the uniform and efficient operation of the courts, provided such rules are not
inconsistent with state law, as set out in Tex. Const. art. 5 § 31. This
constitutional mandate is implemented through statutory provisions, most
notably: Section 74.024 of the Texas Government Code, which authorizes the
Supreme Court to adopt rules of administration setting policies and
guidelines necessary or desirable for the operation and management of the
court system and for the efficient administration of justice (Tex. Gov't. Code
§ 74.024). Section 74.093 of the Texas Government Code, which requires
that local rules of administration be adopted by a majority vote of the
district and statutory county court judges in each county, and that such rules
must address specific administrative functions, including assignment,
docketing, transfer, hearing of cases, and the fair and equitable division of
caseloads (Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.093). Section 74.094 of the Texas
Government Code, which affirms the authority of district and statutory
county court judges to hear and determine matters, sign judgments or
orders, and have those actions be valid and binding, regardless of the
procedural steps taken by court staff (Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.094). Texas
Rules of Judicial Administration The Rules of Judicial Administration, as
updated effective August 1, 2025, are promulgated under the authority of
Section 74.024 and are binding on all Texas courts. Key provisions include:
Rule 10(a): Local rules, forms, and standing orders must not be inconsistent

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
with other laws or rules and must be published on the Office of Court
Administration’s website. Rule 10(e)-(f): The presiding judge of an
administrative judicial region or the Supreme Court may direct a court to
amend or withdraw a local rule, form, or standing order if it fails to comply
with statewide rules or is unfair or unduly burdensome. Rule 10(g): Courts
may not require the use of local forms to the exclusion of Supreme Court-
approved forms, ensuring access to justice is not denied due to local
procedural requirements. Rule 5 and Rule 7: Emphasize the presiding
judge’s responsibility for uniform local rules, efficient docket management,
and prompt disposition of cases, as well as the judge’s administrative
independence. Analysis 1. Inconsistency with Statewide Rules and Statutory
Authority The local rule in question requires that all briefs, proposed orders,
and judgments be presented to the Court Coordinator. This procedural
requirement is not found in the Texas Rules of Judicial Administration or in
the Texas Government Code provisions governing court administration.
Instead, the statewide rules and statutes are designed to ensure that local
rules do not create barriers to the efficient and uniform administration of
justice. Under Rule 10(a) of the Rules of Judicial Administration, local rules
must not be inconsistent with other laws or rules. The Supreme Court’s
rules, promulgated under Section 74.024, are intended to be uniform and to
avoid unnecessary procedural hurdles that could impede the administration
of justice (Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.024). By requiring all substantive filings to
be routed through the Court Coordinator, the local rule imposes an
additional step that is not contemplated by the statewide rules and may
delay or complicate the judge’s ability to act on matters before the court.
Furthermore, Section 74.093 requires that local rules be adopted by a
majority vote of the judges and address specific administrative functions. If
the local rule was not properly adopted or if it interferes with the equitable
division of caseloads or other administrative functions, it is in direct conflict
with the statutory requirements (Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.093). 2. Interference
with Judicial Independence and Efficiency Section 74.094 of the Government
Code grants district and statutory county court judges the authority to hear
and determine matters, sign judgments or orders, and have those actions be
valid and binding, regardless of whether the case is transferred or which
court the judge is sitting in (Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.094). The judge’s
authority is not contingent upon the presentation of documents to a Court
Coordinator. By requiring all briefs, proposed orders, and judgments to be
presented to the Court Coordinator, the local rule could interfere with the
judge’s ability to act independently and efficiently, as intended by the
statute. The Rules of Judicial Administration further emphasize the
importance of efficient docket management and the prompt disposition of
cases (see Rules 5 and 7). Any local rule that creates unnecessary
procedural steps or delays is contrary to these objectives. 3. Uniformity and
Access to Justice The Supreme Court’s rules are designed to promote
uniformity across the state’s courts. Rule 10 specifically prohibits local rules
that are inconsistent with statewide rules and provides mechanisms for the
presiding judge or the Supreme Court to require amendment or withdrawal
of such rules. The requirement that all filings be presented to the Court
Coordinator is not a uniform requirement across Texas courts and may
create confusion or barriers for litigants, particularly those unfamiliar with
local practices. Rule 10(g) also prohibits courts from requiring the use of
local forms to the exclusion of Supreme Court-approved forms, reinforcing

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the principle that access to justice should not be denied due to local
procedural requirements. While the local rule at issue does not directly
address forms, its imposition of a unique procedural step could similarly
impede access to the courts. 4. Adoption and Oversight of Local Rules
Section 74.093 and Rule 10 require that local rules be adopted by a majority
vote of the judges and be published on the Office of Court Administration’s
website. If the local rule requiring presentation to the Court Coordinator
was not properly adopted or published, it is invalid. Even if properly
adopted, the rule must still comply with the requirement that it not be
inconsistent with statewide rules or laws. The Rules of Judicial
Administration provide that the presiding judge of an administrative judicial
region or the Supreme Court may direct a court to amend or withdraw a
local rule if it is found to be unfair, unduly burdensome, or inconsistent with
statewide rules (Rule 10(e)-(f)). This oversight mechanism ensures that local
rules do not undermine the uniformity and efficiency of the court system. 5.
Potential Justifications and Counterarguments It could be argued that the
local rule is intended to facilitate efficient case management by ensuring
that the Court Coordinator is aware of all filings and can assist in scheduling
or administrative matters. However, the Rules of Judicial Administration
already provide mechanisms for efficient docket management and
administrative support without imposing mandatory procedural steps that
could interfere with judicial independence or the uniformity of court
procedures. Moreover, the Supreme Court’s rules and the Government Code
provide for the assignment of administrative responsibilities to judges and
court staff, but these responsibilities must be exercised in a manner
consistent with statewide rules and the judge’s statutory authority.
Exceptions and Caveats There may be circumstances in which a local rule
requiring presentation of documents to the Court Coordinator is
permissible, such as when it is limited to purely administrative matters (e.g.,
scheduling) and does not interfere with the judge’s authority to act on
substantive matters. However, any such rule must still be properly adopted,
published, and consistent with statewide rules and statutes. If the local rule
is interpreted or applied in a manner that does not delay or impede the
judge’s ability to act, and if it is limited to facilitating administrative
efficiency without creating barriers to access or judicial independence, it
may be permissible. However, the broad language of the rule as stated—
requiring all briefs, proposed orders, and judgments to be presented to the
Court Coordinator—suggests a mandatory procedural step that is
inconsistent with the governing legal framework. Conclusion The local rule
requiring all briefs, proposed orders, and judgments to be presented to the
Court Coordinator conflicts with the Texas Rules of Judicial Administration
and the Texas Government Code because it imposes a procedural
requirement not authorized by, and potentially inconsistent with, the
Supreme Court’s statewide rules and the statutory framework for court
administration. Such a rule may interfere with judicial independence,
undermine the uniformity and efficiency of court procedures, and create
unnecessary barriers to access to justice. Local rules must be consistent
with statewide rules, properly adopted, and must not impede the efficient
and uniform administration of justice as mandated by the Texas Supreme
Court and the Texas Government Code. -- HOW DOES A LITIGANT
CHALLENGE THIS RULE? --

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Answer (Texas)
Short response
A litigant may challenge a local rule requiring all briefs, proposed orders,
and judgments to be presented to the Court Coordinator by seeking a writ of
mandamus from the appropriate Texas court of appeals, arguing that the
rule is inconsistent with statewide rules or statutory authority. Alternatively,
the litigant may raise the issue in the trial court through a plea to the
jurisdiction or by objecting to the enforcement of the rule, preserving the
issue for appellate review.
Summary
Texas law provides several mechanisms for challenging local court rules that
conflict with statewide rules or statutory authority. The most direct and
effective method is to seek a writ of mandamus from the court of appeals,
which has explicit statutory authority to compel lower courts to comply with
the law and to invalidate local rules that are inconsistent with the Texas
Rules of Judicial Administration or the Texas Government Code.
Additionally, a litigant may challenge the rule in the trial court by raising a
plea to the jurisdiction or by objecting to the application of the rule, thereby
preserving the issue for appeal. The Texas Supreme Court and courts of
appeals have repeatedly affirmed that local rules must not conflict with
statewide rules or statutes, and that courts of appeals have the power to
grant mandamus relief when a trial court acts without authority or enforces
an invalid local rule.
Background and Relevant Law
Constitutional and Statutory Framework
The Texas Constitution vests the Supreme Court of Texas with the
responsibility for the efficient and uniform administration of the judicial
branch, including the authority to promulgate rules of administration as
necessary, provided they are not inconsistent with state law (Tex. Const. art.
5 § 31). This constitutional mandate is implemented through several key
statutory provisions:
Section 74.024 of the Texas Government Code authorizes the
Supreme Court to adopt rules of administration for the operation and
management of the court system, ensuring the efficient administration
of justice (Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.024).
Section 74.093 requires that local rules of administration be adopted
by a majority vote of the district and statutory county court judges in
each county, and that such rules address specific administrative
functions (Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.093).
• 
• 

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Section 74.094 affirms the authority of district and statutory county
court judges to hear and determine matters, sign judgments or orders,
and have those actions be valid and binding, regardless of procedural
steps taken by court staff (Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.094).
Section 22.004 grants the Supreme Court full rulemaking power over
civil procedure, and local rules may not conflict with these statewide
rules (Tex. Gov't. Code § 22.004).
Section 22.221 empowers each court of appeals to issue writs of
mandamus and all other writs necessary to enforce its jurisdiction,
including writs against district and county judges within its district
(Tex. Gov't. Code § 22.221).
Case Law
Texas appellate courts have consistently held that local rules must not
conflict with statutes or the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and that the
Supreme Court has exclusive authority to promulgate rules of civil
procedure (In re Rio Grande Valley Gas Co., 8 S.W.3d 303 (Tex. 1999); In re
PG & E Reata Energy, et al, 4 S.W.3d 897 (Tex. App. 1999)). When a trial
court acts without authority or enforces a rule that is inconsistent with
higher authority, a litigant may seek mandamus relief (In re McCann, 422
S.W.3d 701 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013); In re Torres, 130 S.W.3d 409 (Tex. App.
2004)).
A plea to the jurisdiction is another procedural vehicle for challenging a
court’s authority to enforce a local rule, particularly if the rule implicates
the court’s subject matter jurisdiction (Hendee v. Dewhurst, 228 S.W.3d 354
(Tex. App. 2007)). The Texas Supreme Court has also clarified that
constitutional challenges to rules must first be brought in the district court
and can only be heard by the Supreme Court in its appellate capacity
(Chenault v. Phillips, 914 S.W.2d 140 (Tex. 1996)).
Analysis
1. Mandamus as the Primary Mechanism
The most direct and authoritative method for challenging a local rule that
conflicts with statewide rules or statutory authority is to seek a writ of
mandamus from the appropriate Texas court of appeals. Section 22.221 of
the Texas Government Code expressly authorizes courts of appeals to issue
writs of mandamus against district and county judges within their district to
enforce the law and their own jurisdiction (Tex. Gov't. Code § 22.221). This
statutory power is reinforced by case law, which confirms that mandamus is
available when a trial court acts without authority or enforces a rule that is
inconsistent with higher authority (In re McCann, 422 S.W.3d 701 (Tex.
Crim. App. 2013); In re Torres, 130 S.W.3d 409 (Tex. App. 2004); In re
Traylor, NUMBER 13-20-00124-CR (Tex. App. Mar 03, 2020)).
To obtain mandamus relief, the relator (the party seeking relief) must show
that the trial court has acted without authority or in violation of a clear legal
duty. In the context of a local rule requiring all briefs, proposed orders, and
• 
• 
• 

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
judgments to be presented to the Court Coordinator, the relator would argue
that the rule is inconsistent with the Texas Rules of Judicial Administration
and the Texas Government Code, which do not authorize such a procedural
requirement and instead emphasize judicial independence and uniformity
(Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.024; Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.094).
The courts of appeals have original jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus
in these circumstances, and the Texas Supreme Court has made clear that
local rules must not conflict with statutes or the Rules of Civil Procedure (In
re Rio Grande Valley Gas Co., 8 S.W.3d 303 (Tex. 1999); In re PG & E Reata
Energy, et al, 4 S.W.3d 897 (Tex. App. 1999)). If the local rule is found to be
inconsistent with statewide rules or statutory authority, the court of appeals
may order the trial court to cease enforcement of the rule.
2. Plea to the Jurisdiction and Objection in the Trial Court
A litigant may also challenge the local rule in the trial court by raising a plea
to the jurisdiction, which is a procedural mechanism for questioning
whether the court has the authority to enforce the rule (Hendee v.
Dewhurst, 228 S.W.3d 354 (Tex. App. 2007)). The Texas Supreme Court has
recognized that a court must resolve legitimate challenges to its jurisdiction
before proceeding on the merits (Texas Dept. Parks and Wildlife v. Miranda,
133 S.W.3d 217 (Tex. 2004)). Although Miranda has been abrogated in part
by a later case, the principle that jurisdictional challenges must be
addressed remains valid.
By objecting to the enforcement of the local rule and raising the issue in the
trial court, the litigant preserves the issue for appellate review. If the trial
court overrules the objection or denies the plea to the jurisdiction, the
litigant may then seek review by the court of appeals, either through an
interlocutory appeal (if available under Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code §
51.014) or by seeking mandamus relief.
3. Challenging the Validity of the Local Rule
A litigant may also challenge the validity of the local rule on the grounds
that it was not properly adopted or published as required by Tex. Gov't.
Code § 74.093. Local rules of administration must be adopted by a majority
vote of the district and statutory county court judges in each county and
must be consistent with statewide rules and statutes. If the rule was not
properly adopted or is inconsistent with higher authority, it is invalid and
unenforceable (In re Rio Grande Valley Gas Co., 8 S.W.3d 303 (Tex. 1999); 
Alpert v. Gerstner, 232 S.W.3d 117 (Tex. App. 2006)).
Additionally, the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, which have the same force
and effect as statutes, prohibit local rules from being inconsistent with state
or federal law or rules adopted by the Supreme Court (Cantu v. Moore,
13-23-00087-CV (Tex. App. Dec 12, 2024); Missouri Pacific Railroad
Company v. Cross, 501 S.W.2d 868 (Tex. 1973)). If the local rule imposes a
procedural requirement not contemplated by the statewide rules, it may be
challenged as invalid.

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
4. Raising Constitutional or Separation of Powers
Arguments
A litigant may also argue that the local rule violates the separation of
powers provision of the Texas Constitution by unduly interfering with the
judiciary’s ability to exercise its constitutionally assigned powers (Parker v.
State, 51 S.W.3d 719 (Tex. App. 2001)). The Texas Supreme Court has
exclusive authority to promulgate rules of civil procedure, and local rules
that conflict with this authority may be challenged on constitutional grounds
(In re PG & E Reata Energy, et al, 4 S.W.3d 897 (Tex. App. 1999)).
However, constitutional challenges to rules must first be brought in the
district court and can only be heard by the Supreme Court in its appellate
capacity (Chenault v. Phillips, 914 S.W.2d 140 (Tex. 1996)). This means that
a litigant raising a constitutional challenge must first present the issue in
the trial court, and then seek appellate review if necessary.
5. Preservation of Error and Appellate Review
Texas appellate procedure requires that complaints or challenges be
presented to the trial court in the first instance, so that the necessary facts
can be developed and the issue preserved for appellate review (Texas Ass'n
of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440 (Tex. 1993)). Failure to
raise the issue in the trial court may result in waiver of the issue on appeal.
If the trial court enforces the local rule over the litigant’s objection, the
litigant may seek review by the court of appeals, either through an
interlocutory appeal (if available) or by seeking mandamus relief. The
appellate court will then determine whether the local rule is inconsistent
with statewide rules or statutory authority and, if so, may order the trial
court to cease enforcement of the rule.
Exceptions and Caveats
There may be circumstances in which a local rule requiring presentation of
documents to the Court Coordinator is permissible, such as when it is
limited to purely administrative matters (e.g., scheduling) and does not
interfere with the judge’s authority to act on substantive matters. However,
any such rule must still be properly adopted, published, and consistent with
statewide rules and statutes (Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.093; Alpert v. Gerstner,
232 S.W.3d 117 (Tex. App. 2006)).
If the local rule is interpreted or applied in a manner that does not delay or
impede the judge’s ability to act, and if it is limited to facilitating
administrative efficiency without creating barriers to access or judicial
independence, it may be permissible. However, the broad language of the
rule as stated—requiring all briefs, proposed orders, and judgments to be
presented to the Court Coordinator—suggests a mandatory procedural step
that is inconsistent with the governing legal framework.

Conclusion
A litigant seeking to challenge a local rule requiring all briefs, proposed
orders, and judgments to be presented to the Court Coordinator has several
procedural avenues available. The most direct and effective method is to
seek a writ of mandamus from the court of appeals, arguing that the rule is
inconsistent with statewide rules or statutory authority. Alternatively, the
litigant may raise the issue in the trial court through a plea to the
jurisdiction or by objecting to the enforcement of the rule, preserving the
issue for appellate review. Texas law is clear that local rules must not
conflict with statutes or the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and the courts of
appeals have the power to grant mandamus relief when a trial court acts
without authority or enforces an invalid local rule. The litigant should ensure
that the issue is properly raised and preserved in the trial court to facilitate
effective appellate review.
Legal Authorities
Alpert v. Gerstner, 232 S.W.3d 117 (Tex. App. 2006)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Section 74.093 of the Texas Government Code provides that district and
statutory county court judges shall adopt local rules of administration
providing for, among other things, the assignment, docketing, and transfer
of cases, subject to the jurisdictional limitations of the district courts and
statutory county courts. TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. § 74.093 (Vernon 2005);
see also Polk, 165 S.W.3d at 93 ('Counties may adopt local rules to further
govern the transfer of cases from one district court to another if they are not
inconsistent' with the rules.); In re Stark, 126 S.W.3d 635, 639 (Tex.App. —
Beaumont 2004, orig. proceeding [mand. denied]) ('District and statutory
county court judges in each county of this state may adopt local rules of
administration that provide for the transfer of all cases, subject to
jurisdictional limitations of those courts.'); In re Rio Grande Valley Gas Co.,
987 S.W.2d at 176 ('District courts are statutorily mandated to adopt local
rules of administration which provide for rules governing transfer of cases.').
Summary
Local rules of administration must be adopted by district and statutory
county court judges and must not be inconsistent with the Texas
Government Code or other rules. This provides a basis for challenging a
local rule if it is inconsistent with statewide rules or statutory requirements.
A litigant could argue that the local rule requiring all briefs, proposed
orders, and judgments to be presented to the Court Coordinator is
inconsistent with the Texas Rules of Judicial Administration and the Texas
Government Code, as it imposes a procedural requirement not authorized by
these higher authorities.

In re Am. Airlines, 02-22-00201-CV (Tex. App. Sep 12, 2022)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A trial judge's lack of compliance with Rule 74 when accepting documents
for filing prevents the district clerk from complying with his or her statutory
and Rule-based duties. That a trial judge to whom a document was tendered
did not comply with the mandatory language of Rule 74 has been construed
as evidence that the judge exercised Rule 74's discretion not to accept the
document for filing. See Currency Forfeiture, 2018 WL 6793787, at *4-5;
Gaz, 919 S.W.2d at 789-90; see also Harbin v. Brown, Graham & Co., No.
07-98-0209-CV, 1999 WL 311097, at *1 (Tex. App.- Amarillo 1999, pet.
denied) (per curiam) (op. on reh'g, not designated for publication).
Summary
A litigant can challenge a local rule by demonstrating that it conflicts with
established procedural rules, such as Rule 74. If a trial judge does not
comply with Rule 74, it can be construed as an exercise of discretion not to
accept a document for filing, which may be challenged if it prevents the
district clerk from fulfilling statutory duties.
Henry v. Cox, 483 S.W.3d 119 (Tex. App. 2015)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The procedural requirements of rules 683 and 684 are mandatory. Qwest
Commc'ns Corp. v. AT & T Corp., 24 S.W.3d 334, 337 (Tex.2000). An order
granting a temporary injunction that does not meet these requirements is
'subject to being declared void and dissolved.' Id.
Summary
The passage highlights that procedural requirements for temporary
injunctions are mandatory, and failure to meet these requirements can
render an injunction void. This suggests that a litigant could challenge a
local rule by seeking a temporary injunction against its enforcement,
ensuring that the procedural requirements are strictly followed. If the
injunction does not comply with these requirements, it can be declared void.

Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The term 'other law' is not limited to other statutes. The commonly
understood meaning of 'law' includes judicial decisions and rules
promulgated by the judiciary, such as rules of procedure and evidence.
Although we know of no case in which this Court has had occasion to
construe the term 'other law' when used in a statute, we have said that our
rules of procedure 'have the same force and effect as statutes.' Missouri Pac.
R.R. v. Cross, 501 S.W.2d 868, 872 (Tex. 1973) ('The Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure have the same force and effect as statutes.') (citing Freeman v.
Freeman, 327 S.W.2d 428, 433 (Tex. 1959) (same)).
Summary
The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure are considered "other law" and have the
same force and effect as statutes. This means that procedural rules
established by the judiciary are recognized as authoritative and binding,
similar to legislative statutes. This understanding is crucial for litigants who
may wish to challenge a local rule that conflicts with statewide procedural
rules, as it underscores the authority of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure in
such matters.
In re McCann, 422 S.W.3d 701 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013)
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
In Stearnes, we held that a trial court that acts without inherent power acts
without authority, and that a relator satisfies 'the first prerequisite for
mandamus relief' when he or she shows that a trial court acted without
authority.
Summary
If a trial court acts without inherent power or authority, a litigant can
challenge this action by seeking mandamus relief. This is relevant to the
question because it provides a legal mechanism for challenging a local rule
that may be inconsistent with higher authority, such as the Texas Rules of
Judicial Administration. The passage suggests that demonstrating a lack of
authority is a key step in obtaining mandamus relief.
In re Prudential Ins. Co. of America, 148 S.W.3d 124 (Tex. 2003)
Texas Supreme Court

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Prudential petitioned the court of appeals for mandamus relief, which that
court denied with a short memorandum opinion, 2002 WL 1608233,
explaining only that 'the relators have not shown themselves entitled to the
relief requested.' Prudential then petitioned for relief from this Court, and
we agreed to hear argument. When we learned that the trial judge who
denied Prudential's motion to quash had left office, we abated our
proceeding to allow the parties to seek reconsideration by the current judge,
as required by Rule 7.2(b) of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure.
Summary
A litigant can challenge a procedural rule by seeking mandamus relief from
a higher court. In this case, Prudential sought mandamus relief from the
court of appeals and then from the Texas Supreme Court. The process
involved petitioning for relief and, when necessary, seeking reconsideration
by a new judge if the original judge is no longer in office. This indicates that
mandamus relief is a viable method for challenging procedural rules or
decisions that a litigant believes are incorrect or unjust.
Chenault v. Phillips, 914 S.W.2d 140 (Tex. 1996)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Relators argue that this Court has jurisdiction over this original action under
Article III of the Texas Constitution, sections 22.001-.002 of the Government
Code, and Rules 121 and 122 of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure.
This Court's jurisdiction, like that of all Texas courts, is conferred solely by
the Texas Constitution and state statutes. We do not have jurisdiction to
decide any case absent an express constitutional or statutory grant. ...
constitutional challenges to rules enacted by this Court must be brought in
the district court and heard by this Court in the exercise of its appellate
jurisdiction.
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court's jurisdiction is limited to what is expressly
granted by the Texas Constitution and state statutes. It clarifies that
constitutional challenges to rules must first be brought in the district court
and can only be heard by the Supreme Court in its appellate capacity. This
suggests that a litigant challenging a local rule, such as the one requiring all
briefs, proposed orders, and judgments to be presented to the Court
Coordinator, would need to initiate the challenge in a district court.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The separation of powers provision of the Texas Constitution may be violated
in two ways: (1) when one branch of government assumes, or is delegated,
to whatever degree, a power that is more 'properly attached' to another
branch, and (2) when one branch unduly interferes with another branch
such that the other branch cannot effectively exercise its constitutionally
assigned powers. See State v. Williams, 938 S.W.2d 456, 458 (Tex. Crim.
App. 1997).
Summary
A litigant could challenge the local rule by arguing that it violates the
separation of powers provision of the Texas Constitution. Specifically, the
rule could be seen as unduly interfering with the judiciary's ability to
exercise its constitutionally assigned powers, as it imposes a procedural
requirement not authorized by the Texas Supreme Court's statewide rules.
In re Rio Grande Valley Gas Co., 8 S.W.3d 303 (Tex. 1999)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The local rules adopted by the district judges in Hidalgo County and
approved by this Court do not authorize transfer of the cases. This Court
cannot promulgate rules in contradiction of statutes except by the procedure
prescribed in section 22.004 of the Government Code, which was not
followed when the Hidalgo County local rules were approved. Nor can I
imagine that this Court would ever authorize a local rule that conflicted with
a statute. Moreover, local rules are not to be inconsistent with the Rules of
Civil Procedure.
Summary
Local rules must not conflict with statutes or the Rules of Civil Procedure.
The Texas Supreme Court emphasizes that it cannot approve local rules that
contradict statutes unless a specific procedure is followed. This indicates
that a litigant could challenge a local rule by demonstrating that it conflicts
with a statute or the Rules of Civil Procedure, as such a rule would be
unauthorized and invalid.

See Tex. R. Civ. P. 3a (providing that the trial courts and administrative
judicial regions can make and amend local rules and stating the local rules
'may not be inconsistent with state or federal law or rules adopted by the
Supreme Court of Texas'); see also Bourque v. State, 156 S.W.3d 675, 678
(Tex. App.-Dallas 2005, pet. ref'd) (recognizing the authority of district
judges to adopt rules governing the administration of multiple district
courts); Bazan v. State, No. 13-08-00169-CR, 2010 WL 596832, at *2 (Tex.
App.-Corpus Christi-Edinburg Feb. 18, 2010, pet. ref'd) (mem. op., not
designated for publication) (refusing 'to construe the local rules of
administration... in such a way that they divest the trial court').
Summary
Local rules in Texas must not be inconsistent with state or federal law or
rules adopted by the Supreme Court of Texas. This provides a basis for
challenging a local rule if it is inconsistent with higher authority rules. The
passage also highlights the authority of district judges to adopt rules but
emphasizes that these rules should not divest the trial court of its authority.
This implies that a litigant can challenge a local rule by arguing that it is
inconsistent with state or federal law or that it improperly limits the court's
authority.
In re PG & E Reata Energy, et al, 4 S.W.3d 897 (Tex. App. 1999)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The rule-making authority for the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure is vested
exclusively in the Supreme Court of Texas, and no other court in Texas is
authorized or empowered to enact or amend rules of civil procedure that
would be inconsistent with the rules promulgated by the supreme court. See
TEX. R. CIV. P. 3a; Centennial, 803 S.W.2d at 482.
Summary
The passage highlights that the Texas Supreme Court has exclusive
authority to create and amend rules of civil procedure. This means that any
local rule that conflicts with the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, such as the
one requiring all briefs, proposed orders, and judgments to be presented to
the Court Coordinator, can be challenged on the grounds that it is
inconsistent with the rules established by the Supreme Court. A litigant
could argue that the local rule is invalid because it conflicts with the
statewide rules, which have the force of statutory provisions.

A challenge to a trial court's subject matter jurisdiction may be asserted in a
plea to the jurisdiction. Texas Dep't of Parks & Wildlife v. Miranda, 133 S.W.
3d 217, 225-26 (Tex.2004); Bland Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Blue, 34 S.W.3d 547,
554 (Tex. 2000). Whether a court has subject matter jurisdiction is a
question of law. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 226. The determination of whether a
trial court has subject matter jurisdiction begins with the pleadings. Id. The
pleader has the initial burden of alleging facts that affirmatively
demonstrate the trial court's jurisdiction to hear the cause. Id. (citing Texas
Ass'n of Bus. v. Texas Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 446 (Tex.1993)).
Summary
A litigant can challenge a local rule by asserting a plea to the jurisdiction.
This involves questioning whether the trial court has the subject matter
jurisdiction to enforce the rule. The determination of jurisdiction is a legal
question, and the pleader must initially demonstrate facts that affirmatively
show the court's jurisdiction. This process is applicable in Texas and
provides a legal avenue for challenging procedural rules that may be
inconsistent with higher authority rules or statutes.
Turtur v. Lee, 702 S.W.2d 309 (Tex. App. 1986)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Relator seeks to prevent implementation of a discovery order issued by the
Respondent in a divorce proceeding pending in the 257th District Court of
Harris County. The real party in interest has objected to any exercise of
mandamus authority by this Court over a district judge whose domicile and
place of office is in Harris County, outside the territorial limits of this Court,
and in connection with litigation pending in Respondent's court. Relator
contends that Section 22.221(b) of the Texas Government Code (Vernon
1986 Pamphlet) extends statewide territorial jurisdiction to this Court in
such a mandamus proceeding: Each court of appeals may issue all writs of
mandamus, agreeable to the principles of law regulating those writs, against
a judge of a district or county court.
Summary
Texas appellate courts have the authority to issue writs of mandamus
against district or county court judges, which can be used to challenge
procedural rules or orders that are inconsistent with higher authority or
statutory requirements. The passage specifically addresses the jurisdictional

aspect of such proceedings, emphasizing the territorial limits and the
principles of law regulating writs of mandamus.
In re Traylor, NUMBER 13-20-00124-CR (Tex. App. Mar 03, 2020)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Article V, Section 6 of the Texas Constitution delineates the appellate
jurisdiction of the courts of appeals, and states that the courts of appeals
'shall have such other jurisdiction, original and appellate, as may be
prescribed by law.' TEX. CONST. art. V, § 6(a); see In re Bayview Loan
Servicing, LLC, 532 S.W.3d 510, 511 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2017, orig.
proceeding). This Court's original jurisdiction is governed by section 22.221
of the Texas Government Code. See TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. § 22.221; see
also In re Cook, 394 S.W.3d 668, 671 (Tex. App.—Tyler 2012, orig.

of mandamus against district and county judges within our district and 'all
other writs necessary to enforce the jurisdiction of the court.' See TEX.
GOV'T CODE ANN. § 22.221(a),(b).
Summary
Jurisdiction of the Texas Courts of Appeals, specifically their authority to
issue writs of mandamus against district and county judges within their
district. This is relevant to challenging a local rule because a litigant could
potentially seek a writ of mandamus from the Court of Appeals to challenge
the enforcement of a local rule that conflicts with statewide rules or
statutes. The passage provides insight into the procedural mechanism
available to litigants for such challenges.
Story v. State, 654 S.W.3d 234 (Tex. App. 2022)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The jurisdiction of Texas courts is conferred solely by the Texas Constitution
and state statutes. Chenault v. Phillips, 914 S.W.2d 140, 141 (Tex. 1996) (per
curiam). Section 24.007 of the Government Code provides: 'The district
court has the jurisdiction provided by Article V, Section 8, of the Texas
Constitution.' TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. § 24.007(a). Article V, Section 8, of
the Texas Constitution states in pertinent part: District Court jurisdiction
consists of exclusive, appellate, and original jurisdiction of all actions,
proceedings, and remedies, except in cases where exclusive, appellate, or
original jurisdiction may be conferred by this Constitution or other law on
some other court, tribunal, or administrative body. District Court judges

shall have the power to issue writs necessary to enforce their jurisdiction.
TEX. CONST. art. V, § 8. Section 24.011 of the Government Code further
states: 'A judge of a district court may, either in termtime or vacation, grant
writs of mandamus, injunction, sequestration, attachment, garnishment,
certiorari, and supersedeas and all other writs necessary to the enforcement
of the court's jurisdiction.' TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. § 24.011.
Summary
District courts have the power to issue such writs to ensure compliance with
their jurisdiction, which is relevant to challenging local rules that may
conflict with statewide rules or statutes.
In re Torres, 130 S.W.3d 409 (Tex. App. 2004)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Section 22.221 of the government code authorizes courts of appeals to issue
writs of mandamus or other writs necessary to enforce its jurisdiction, issue
writs of mandamus agreeable to principles of law regulating such writs
against a judge of a district or county court in the appellate court's district,
and issue writs of habeas corpus in certain instances. See Tex. Gov't Code
Ann. § 22.221 (Vernon Supp.2004); Fritz, 750 S.W.2d at 932.
Summary
Under Section 22.221 of the Texas Government Code, courts of appeals have
the authority to issue writs of mandamus to enforce their jurisdiction. This
includes issuing writs against judges of district or county courts within the
appellate court's district. This suggests that a litigant could challenge a local
rule by seeking a writ of mandamus from the court of appeals, arguing that
the rule is inconsistent with statewide rules or laws and interferes with
judicial independence or efficiency.

1), but they are not to be ignored by agreements of courts and counsel to
operate contrary thereto and in violation thereof.
Summary
The passage emphasizes that the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure have the
same authority as statutes and must be adhered to, even in the face of
agreements between courts and counsel that might contravene them. This
suggests that a litigant could challenge a local rule by arguing that it
conflicts with the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, which are to be liberally
construed to ensure fair and impartial adjudication.
Texas Dept. Parks and Wildlife v. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d 217 (Tex. 2004)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
We adhere to the fundamental precept that a court must not proceed on the
merits of a case until legitimate challenges to its jurisdiction have been
decided. ... Thus, the Texas civil procedural scheme entrusts many
scheduling and procedural issues to the sound discretion of the trial court,
subject to appellate review. ... In his dissent, Justice Brister takes the view
that all pleas to jurisdiction based on immunity must take the form of two
'standard' or 'established' motions—either special exceptions or motions for
summary judgment. ... The plea to the jurisdiction was included in
procedural rules promulgated by this Court in 1877 and has been used as a
procedural vehicle to challenge subject matter jurisdiction in trial courts for
over a century and a half.
Summary
In Texas, litigants can challenge jurisdictional issues through established
procedural vehicles such as pleas to the jurisdiction, special exceptions, or
motions for summary judgment. These mechanisms allow litigants to
address jurisdictional challenges before a court proceeds on the merits of a
case. The passage highlights the importance of resolving jurisdictional
challenges and the discretion afforded to trial courts in procedural matters,
subject to appellate review.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Texas has with good reason determined that standing is not excepted from
traditional rules of appellate procedure. Our appellate system is predicated
on the requirement of presentation of complaints to the lower court coupled
with preservation and briefing in the reviewing court. See Tex.R.App.P. 52;
74(d), 131(e). Appellate courts face considerable difficulties in deciding an
issue not presented to the trial court; ordinarily, the necessary facts will not
be fully developed. The unstated effect of today&#39;s opinion is to require
trial courts to develop facts as to undisputed issues or risk subsequent
appellate reversal. This is not an effective use of our limited judicial
resources.
Summary
In Texas, a litigant must first present their complaints or challenges to the
trial court. This is a procedural requirement to ensure that the necessary
facts are developed and that the issue is preserved for appellate review. The
passage highlights the importance of this process in the Texas appellate
system, which is designed to prevent appellate courts from having to decide
issues that were not fully developed at the trial level.
Tex. Const. art. 5 § 31 Tex. Const. art. 5 § 31 Court Administration; Rule-

Extract
The Supreme Court is responsible for the efficient administration of the
judicial branch and shall promulgate rules of administration not inconsistent
with the laws of the state as may be necessary for the efficient and uniform
administration of justice in the various courts.
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court has the authority to promulgate rules of
administration for the efficient and uniform administration of justice. This
implies that any local rule that conflicts with the Supreme Court's rules or
the efficient administration of justice could be challenged on the grounds
that it is inconsistent with the Supreme Court's authority and the
constitutional mandate for uniformity.

Extract
The supreme court may adopt rules of administration setting policies and
guidelines necessary or desirable for the operation and management of the
court system and for the efficient administration of justice.
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court has the authority to adopt rules of administration
for the efficient operation and management of the court system. This implies
that any local rule that conflicts with these statewide rules could potentially
be challenged on the grounds that it is inconsistent with the Supreme
Court's authority and the statutory framework for court administration. A
litigant could argue that the local rule is not authorized by the Supreme
Court's rules and therefore should be invalidated.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.094 Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.094 Hearing Cases
Extract
A district or statutory county court judge may hear and determine a matter
pending in any district or statutory county court in the county regardless of
whether the matter is preliminary or final or whether there is a judgment in
the matter. The judge may sign a judgment or order in any of the courts
regardless of whether the case is transferred. The judgment, order, or action
is valid and binding as if the case were pending in the court of the judge
who acts in the matter.
Summary
Judges in Texas have the authority to hear and determine matters and sign
judgments or orders without the procedural requirement of presenting
documents to a Court Coordinator. This suggests that a litigant could
challenge the local rule by arguing that it interferes with the judge's
statutory authority to act independently and efficiently, as the judge's
actions are valid and binding regardless of procedural steps taken by court
staff.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.093 Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.093 Rules of Administration
Extract
The district and statutory county court judges in each county shall, by
majority vote, adopt local rules of administration.

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
Local rules of administration must be adopted by a majority vote of the
district and statutory county court judges in each county. This implies that if
a litigant wishes to challenge a local rule, they could potentially argue that
the rule was not properly adopted according to this requirement.
Additionally, if the rule is inconsistent with statewide rules or laws, a litigant
could challenge it on those grounds as well.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.092 Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.092 Duties of Local
Administrative Judge
Extract
A local administrative judge, for the courts for which the judge serves as
local administrative judge, shall: implement and execute the local rules of
administration, including the assignment, docketing, transfer, and hearing of
cases; ... promulgate local rules of administration if the other judges do not
act by a majority vote; ... supervise the expeditious movement of court
caseloads, subject to local, regional, and state rules of administration; ...
perform other duties as may be directed by the chief justice or a regional
presiding judge;
Summary
The local administrative judge has the authority to implement and execute
local rules of administration, and can promulgate local rules if other judges
do not act by a majority vote. This suggests that the local administrative
judge plays a key role in the establishment and enforcement of local rules.
Therefore, a litigant seeking to challenge a local rule, such as the one
requiring all briefs, proposed orders, and judgments to be presented to the
Court Coordinator, might consider addressing their concerns to the local
administrative judge. Additionally, since the local administrative judge must
act in accordance with local, regional, and state rules of administration, a
litigant could argue that the rule in question is inconsistent with higher
authority rules, as discussed in the original analysis.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.046 Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.046 Duties of Presiding
Judge
Extract
A presiding judge shall: ensure the promulgation of regional rules of
administration within policies and guidelines set by the supreme court;
advise local judges on case flow management and auxiliary court services;
recommend to the chief justice of the supreme court any needs for judicial
assignments from outside the region; recommend to the supreme court any
changes in the organization, jurisdiction, operation, or procedures of the

region necessary or desirable for the improvement of the administration of
justice; act for a local administrative judge when the local administrative
judge does not perform the duties required by Subchapter D; implement and
execute any rules adopted by the supreme court under this chapter; provide
the supreme court or the office of court administration statistical
information requested; and perform the duties assigned by the chief justice
of the supreme court.
Summary
The presiding judge has the authority to ensure that regional rules of
administration are promulgated within the policies and guidelines set by the
Supreme Court. This includes advising local judges and recommending
changes to the Supreme Court. This suggests that a litigant could potentially
challenge a local rule by bringing it to the attention of the presiding judge,
who has the duty to ensure compliance with Supreme Court guidelines and
can recommend changes to the Supreme Court if necessary.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 22.004 Tex. Gov't. Code § 22.004 Rules of Civil Procedure
Extract
The supreme court has the full rulemaking power in the practice and
procedure in civil actions, except that its rules may not abridge, enlarge, or
modify the substantive rights of a litigant. The supreme court from time to
time may promulgate a specific rule or rules of civil procedure, or an
amendment or amendments to a specific rule or rules, to be effective at the
time the supreme court deems expedient in the interest of a proper
administration of justice. The rules and amendments to rules remain in
effect unless and until disapproved by the legislature.
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court has the authority to promulgate rules of civil
procedure, which includes the power to amend or repeal conflicting local
rules. This means that if a local rule, such as the one requiring all briefs,
proposed orders, and judgments to be presented to the Court Coordinator, is
inconsistent with the Supreme Court's rules, it can be challenged on the
basis that it conflicts with the statewide rules. The Supreme Court's rules
are intended to ensure uniformity and efficiency in court procedures, and
any local rule that creates unnecessary procedural steps or delays could be
subject to challenge.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 22.221 Tex. Gov't. Code § 22.221 Writ Power

=== PAGE 22 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Each court of appeals or a justice of a court of appeals may issue a writ of
mandamus and all other writs necessary to enforce the jurisdiction of the
court. Subject to Subsection (c-1), each court of appeals for a court of
appeals district may issue all writs of mandamus, agreeable to the principles
of law regulating those writs, against a judge of a district, statutory county,
statutory probate county, or county court in the court of appeals district.
Summary
A litigant can challenge a local rule by seeking a writ of mandamus from the
court of appeals. This writ can be used to compel a lower court or judge to
perform a duty required by law, which in this case could involve challenging
the enforcement of a local rule that conflicts with statewide rules or
statutory authority.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 71.035 Tex. Gov't. Code § 71.035 Statistics; Enforcement
By Mandamus
Extract
The duty provided by this section to supply information may be enforced by
writ of mandamus in: the district court of the county of residence of the
respondent if the petition for mandamus is filed against a district clerk or a
clerk, judge, or other official of a trial court other than a district court; the
court of appeals for the court of appeals district in which the respondent
resides if the petition for mandamus is filed against a district judge or a
clerk of a court of appeals; or the supreme court in any other case.
Summary
Mechanism for enforcing duties related to court administration through a
writ of mandamus. This suggests that a litigant could potentially challenge a
local rule by seeking a writ of mandamus if the rule is seen as inconsistent
with statewide rules or statutory authority.

there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion; and an immediate
appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of

Summary
Mechanism for appealing interlocutory orders, which are non-final orders
issued by a court. Specifically, it allows for an appeal if the order involves a
controlling question of law with substantial grounds for difference of
opinion, and if an immediate appeal may materially advance the termination
of the litigation. This could be relevant for challenging a local rule if it is
embodied in an interlocutory order that meets these criteria.
