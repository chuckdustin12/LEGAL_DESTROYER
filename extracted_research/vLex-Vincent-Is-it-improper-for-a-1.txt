Question
Is it improper for a court coordinator to handle recusal procedures?
Answer (Texas)
Short response
Based on Texas law, it would be improper for a court coordinator to handle recusal procedures, as Texas statutes and case law explicitly assign these
responsibilities to judges. The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, Texas Government Code, and numerous court decisions clearly establish that only judges have
the authority to handle recusal procedures, with the responsibility falling specifically on the judge subject to recusal or the regional presiding judge.
Summary
Texas law establishes a clear and mandatory procedure for handling motions to recuse judges. When a motion to recuse is filed, the judge who is the subject of
the motion must either sign an order of recusal or refer the motion to the regional presiding judge for consideration. This procedure is explicitly outlined in Texas
Rule of Civil Procedure 18a and Texas Government Code § 74.059(c)(3), which place the responsibility for these actions solely on judges, not court coordinators
or other court staff.
Courts across Texas have consistently held that the recusal procedure is mandatory and must be followed precisely as outlined in the applicable rules and
statutes. The Texas Supreme Court has affirmed that the judge subject to a recusal motion must either recuse themselves or request the presiding judge to
assign another judge to hear the motion. No Texas authority grants court coordinators the power to handle these procedures, and allowing them to do so would
contradict the express provisions of Texas law that vest this responsibility exclusively with judges.
Background and Relevant Legislation
Texas Administrative Code
The Texas Administrative Code provides specific guidance on the procedures for disqualification or recusal of judges. 1 Tex. Admin. Code § 155.152 states that a
judge is subject to recusal or disqualification on the same grounds and under the same circumstances as specified in Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18b.
Importantly, the code specifies that "If the presiding judge who is the subject of the motion disqualifies or recuses him- or herself based on the motion, the Chief
Judge or a designee of the Chief Judge shall assign a different presiding judge to the case. If the presiding judge who is the subject of the motion does not
disqualify or recuse him- or herself from the case, the Chief Judge or a designee of the Chief Judge shall assign another judge to consider and rule on the
motion."
This provision explicitly designates the responsibility for handling recusal procedures to judicial officers—specifically the Chief Judge or their designee—rather
than to court coordinators or other non-judicial staff members. The language is clear that it is the Chief Judge (or their designee) who has the authority to assign
judges in recusal matters, not court coordinators.
Texas Government Code
The Texas Government Code further clarifies the procedures for recusal motions. As noted in In re Alpert, 276 S.W.3d 592 (Tex. App. 2008), Texas Government
Code vests the "presiding judge of the administrative judicial district" with the authority to assign a judge to hear a motion for recusal.
More specifically, In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006) references section 74.059(c)(3) of the Government Code, which states that a district, statutory
probate, or statutory county court judge shall "request the presiding judge to assign another judge to hear a motion relating to the recusal of the judge from a case
pending in his court." This provision places the responsibility squarely on the judge, not any other court personnel such as a coordinator.
Texas Rules of Civil Procedure
The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure establish the mandatory procedure for handling recusal motions. In re Burns clarifies that under "Tex.R.Civ.P. 18a(f)" a
respondent judge, within three business days after a motion to recuse is filed, must sign and file with the clerk (1) an order of recusal or disqualification; or (2) an
order referring the motion to the regional presiding judge.
Similarly, In re Amir-Sharif, NUMBER 13-19-00573-CV (Tex. App. Dec 12, 2019) references Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(f)(1), which states that:
"[r]egardless of whether the motion complies with this rule, the respondent judge, within three business days after the motion is filed, must either: (A) sign and file
with the clerk an order of recusal or disqualification; or (B) sign and file with the clerk an order referring the motion to the regional presiding judge."
These procedural rules clearly assign the responsibility for handling recusal motions to the judge who is the subject of the motion, not to court coordinators or
other administrative staff. The rules require the judge to take specific actions within a defined timeframe, indicating that this is a judicial function that cannot be
delegated to non-judicial personnel.
Analysis of Case Law
Texas courts have consistently interpreted these statutory provisions and procedural rules as creating a mandatory framework for handling recusal motions that
must be followed by judges. The case law uniformly supports the conclusion that it is improper for a court coordinator to handle recusal procedures.
Mandatory Nature of Recusal Procedures

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The Texas Supreme Court established in McLeod v. Harris, 582 S.W.2d 772 (Tex. 1979) that the statutory requirement for a judge to request the presiding judge
to assign another judge to hear a recusal motion is mandatory. The court stated that "The statute merely requires that another judge be assigned to determine the
merits of the motion." This decision established the foundational principle that recusal procedures must be handled by judges, not by other court personnel.
This principle was reiterated in Hudson v. Texas Children's Hosp., 177 S.W.3d 232 (Tex. 2005), where the Texas Supreme Court confirmed that "The Texas
Supreme Court has held that the recuse or refer procedure is mandatory." The court explained that "Once a motion to recuse is filed in statutory probate court,
the trial judge has two options before taking any other action: (1) recuse himself or (2) request that the presiding judge of the statutory probate courts assign a
judge to hear the motion to recuse."
Similarly, Rio Grande Valley Gas Co., In re, 987 S.W.2d 167 (Tex. App. 1999) emphasized that "In 1979, the Texas Supreme Court held the requirements of
article 200a, § 6 were mandatory and a district judge must request the presiding judge to assign a judge to hear any motion to recuse." The court noted that the
substance of that provision is now found in Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a and Texas Government Code § 74.059(c)(3).
Limited Options for Judges
Multiple Texas court decisions have emphasized that judges have only two options when faced with a recusal motion: recuse themselves or refer the motion to
the presiding judge. Mosley v. State, 141 S.W.3d 816 (Tex. App. 2004) stated that "In addition, when a motion to recuse is filed, a trial court has only two options:
recusal or referral of the case to the presiding judge for a determination as to its merits." The court further noted that "Even if a motion to recuse is procedurally
defective, the challenged judge must either grant the motion or refer the motion, so another judge can determine the merits of the motion to recuse."
Woodruff v. Wright, 51 S.W.3d 727 (Tex. App. 2001) similarly held that "When a motion to recuse has been filed, a judge must either recuse himself or request
the presiding administrative judge to assign another judge to hear the motion."
Barron v. State Atty. Gen., 108 S.W.3d 379 (Tex. App. 2003) provides additional detail on the procedure, noting that "Before proceeding further in the case, the
judge must either recuse himself or, if he declines recusal, request the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district to assign a judge to hear the motion."
In re A.T.M., NO. 09-19-00032-CV (Tex. App. Sep 24, 2020) reaffirms this understanding, stating that "Upon receiving a motion to recuse, a trial judge has two
choices: (1) they can sign an order of recusal; or (2) refer the motion to the regional presiding judge."
Authority to Assign Judges in Recusal Matters
The case law also clarifies who has the authority to assign judges in recusal matters. In re Alpert, 276 S.W.3d 592 (Tex. App. 2008) states that "Both the Texas
Government Code and Texas Rules of Civil Procedure vest the 'presiding judge of the administrative judicial district' with the authority to assign a judge to hear a
motion for recusal." The court also noted that "the applicable Rule of Civil Procedure designates the presiding administrative judicial district judge-or, in some
cases, the Chief Justice of the Texas Supreme Court-to undertake that particular task."
This explicit designation of authority to the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district (or in some cases the Chief Justice) precludes court coordinators
from having any role in assigning judges to hear recusal motions.
Secondary Materials on Recusal Procedures
Secondary materials consistently reinforce the understanding established in the statutes and case law. Trial motions states that "Once a sufficient motion to
recuse has been filed, before proceeding further in the case, the judge must either recuse himself or request the presiding judge of the administrative judicial
district to assign a judge to hear the motion under Tex. Gov't Code §74.059(c)(3)."
Similarly, Pretrial Motions reiterates that "Once a sufficient motion to recuse has been filed, before proceeding further in the case, the judge must either recuse
himself or request the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district to assign a judge to hear the motion under Tex. Gov't Code §74.059(c)(3)."
These secondary sources align with the primary authorities in emphasizing that the responsibility for handling recusal procedures lies with judges, not with court
coordinators or other non-judicial personnel.
Analysis of the Propriety of Court Coordinator Involvement
Based on the legislation and case law reviewed, it would be improper for a court coordinator to handle recusal procedures in Texas courts for several key
reasons:
1. Explicit Statutory Assignment of Responsibility
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(f)(1) explicitly requires that the "respondent judge" must take specific actions within three business days of a recusal motion
being filed. The rule leaves no room for delegation to non-judicial personnel such as court coordinators, as it specifically assigns this responsibility to the judge.
Similarly, Texas Government Code § 74.059(c)(3) states that a judge "shall request the presiding judge to assign another judge" to hear a recusal motion, again
placing this responsibility specifically on the judge.
2. Judicial Function Requiring Judicial Authorization
The handling of recusal procedures involves judicial decision-making and authority. The judge must decide whether to recuse or refer the motion, and only certain
judicial officers (the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district or the Chief Justice) have the authority to assign judges to hear recusal motions. Court
coordinators, as non-judicial personnel, lack the authority to make these decisions or assignments.
3. Mandatory Nature of Recusal Procedures

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Texas courts have consistently held that the recusal procedures outlined in the rules and statutes are mandatory and must be followed precisely. The Texas
Supreme Court in McLeod v. Harris, 582 S.W.2d 772 (Tex. 1979) and subsequent cases have emphasized the mandatory nature of these procedures. Allowing a
court coordinator to handle recusal procedures would constitute a departure from these mandatory procedures.
4. Limited Options Available to Judges
The case law consistently states that judges have only two options when faced with a recusal motion: recuse themselves or refer the motion to the presiding
judge. There is no provision for a third option of delegating the handling of recusal procedures to a court coordinator or other non-judicial personnel.
5. Absence of Authority Granting Court Coordinators This Role
None of the statutory provisions or cases reviewed mentions court coordinators as having any role in handling recusal procedures. In fact, 1 Tex. Admin. Code §
155.152 specifically states that if a judge recuses based on a motion, "the Chief Judge or a designee of the Chief Judge shall assign a different presiding judge to
the case," and if the judge does not recuse, "the Chief Judge or a designee of the Chief Judge shall assign another judge to consider and rule on the motion."
This language clearly indicates that the responsibility for assigning judges in recusal matters lies with the Chief Judge or their designee, not with court
coordinators.
Potential Counterarguments and Their Limitations
Argument: Court Coordinators Perform Administrative Functions
One might argue that court coordinators perform various administrative functions in the court system, and handling the paperwork or logistics related to recusal
motions could be considered an administrative function. However, this argument fails because:
The rules and statutes specifically assign the responsibility for handling recusal motions to judges, not to administrative staff.
The handling of recusal motions involves judicial decision-making (whether to recuse or refer), which is beyond the scope of administrative functions.
The assignment of judges to hear recusal motions is specifically vested in certain judicial officers (presiding judges or the Chief Justice), not in administrative
staff.
Argument: Delegation of Authority
Another potential argument is that judges could delegate their authority to handle certain aspects of recusal procedures to court coordinators. However, this
argument is also flawed because:
The rules and statutes use mandatory language ("must," "shall") that does not allow for delegation of these specific responsibilities.
Texas courts have consistently emphasized the mandatory nature of recusal procedures, indicating that they must be followed precisely as outlined in the
rules and statutes.
The decision to recuse or refer a recusal motion is inherently judicial in nature and cannot be delegated to non-judicial personnel.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the general rule is that court coordinators should not handle recusal procedures, there may be limited circumstances where court coordinators could
perform purely ministerial functions related to recusal motions, such as:
Receiving and filing the initial recusal motion (though the responsibility for acting on the motion still lies with the judge).
Communicating the judge's decision to recuse or refer the motion to the appropriate parties, after the judge has made that decision.
Facilitating administrative communication between judges regarding recusal matters, provided that the actual decisions and orders are made and signed by
the appropriate judges.
However, these limited ministerial functions do not constitute "handling recusal procedures" in the substantive sense, and court coordinators should not be
making decisions, signing orders, or otherwise substantively involved in the recusal process.
Conclusion
Based on the comprehensive review of Texas law regarding recusal procedures, it is clear that it would be improper for a court coordinator to handle recusal
procedures. The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, Texas Government Code, and numerous court decisions establish a mandatory framework for handling recusal
motions that places the responsibility squarely on judges, not on court coordinators or other non-judicial personnel.
When a motion to recuse is filed, the judge who is the subject of the motion must either sign an order of recusal or refer the motion to the regional presiding judge.
Only certain judicial officers—specifically the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district or, in some cases, the Chief Justice of the Texas Supreme
Court—have the authority to assign judges to hear recusal motions.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The mandatory nature of these procedures, as consistently affirmed by Texas courts, does not allow for delegation to court coordinators. The absence of any
provision in the relevant statutes or case law granting court coordinators a role in handling recusal procedures further supports the conclusion that such
involvement would be improper.
While court coordinators may perform limited ministerial functions related to the recusal process, substantive handling of recusal procedures—including making
decisions on recusal motions or assigning judges to hear such motions—falls exclusively within the purview of judges as prescribed by Texas law. Any deviation
from these established procedures would be contrary to the explicit requirements of Texas statutes, rules, and case law.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
In 1979, the Texas Supreme Court held the requirements of article 200a, § 6 were mandatory and a district judge must request the presiding judge to assign a
judge to hear any motion to recuse. McLeod v. Harris, 582 S.W.2d 772, 775 (Tex.1979). The substance of article 200a, § 6 is now found in Texas Rule of Civil
Procedure 18a, promulgated by the supreme court and effective January 1, 1981, and TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. § 74.059(c)(3). Keene, 863 S.W.2d at 183.
Section 74.059(c)(3) provides, in pertinent part: (c) A district, statutory probate, or statutory county court judge shall: .... (3) request the presiding judge to assign
another judge to hear a motion relating to the recusal of the judge from a case pending in his court[.] (emphasis added).
Summary
The procedure for handling recusal motions is clearly defined by Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a and TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. § 74.059(c)(3). These rules
mandate that a judge must either recuse themselves or request the presiding judge to assign another judge to hear the motion. This suggests that the
responsibility for handling recusal procedures lies with the judges and not with court coordinators.
