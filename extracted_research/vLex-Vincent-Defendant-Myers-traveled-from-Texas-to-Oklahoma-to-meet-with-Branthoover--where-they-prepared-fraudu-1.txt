Question
Defendant Myers traveled from Texas to Oklahoma to meet with
Branthoover, where they prepared fraudulent legal documents and
coordinated the transfer of marital funds. 18 U.S.C. § 1952 (Travel Act)
prohibits interstate travel or use of interstate facilities with intent to
promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate unlawful activity,
including fraud and theft. Myers’ interstate travel for the purpose of
preparing and executing fraudulent legal and financial acts satisfies the
Travel Act, providing another RICO predicate.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Based on the legal materials provided, the described conduct of Myers
traveling from Texas to Oklahoma to prepare fraudulent legal documents
and coordinate the transfer of marital funds satisfies the elements of the
Travel Act (18 U.S.C. § 1952), as it involves interstate travel with intent to
promote or facilitate unlawful activity, followed by overt acts in furtherance
of that unlawful activity. This Travel Act violation can serve as a predicate
act for RICO purposes.
Summary
The Travel Act (18 U.S.C. § 1952) prohibits interstate travel or the use of
interstate facilities with the intent to promote, manage, establish, carry on,
or facilitate unlawful activity, followed by the performance or attempted
performance of such acts. The provided case law consistently establishes
that to prove a Travel Act violation, the government must show: (1)
interstate travel or use of interstate facilities; (2) with intent to promote or
facilitate unlawful activity; and (3) subsequent performance of acts in
furtherance of the unlawful activity. Myers' conduct of traveling from Texas
to Oklahoma to meet with Branthoover for the purpose of preparing
fraudulent legal documents and coordinating the transfer of marital funds
satisfies all these elements.
The courts have consistently held that the Travel Act does not require proof
that the underlying unlawful activity was accomplished, only that there was
interstate travel with the requisite intent, followed by some act in
furtherance of the unlawful activity. The courts have also clarified that while
the act performed after travel must be in furtherance of the unlawful
activity, it need not itself be unlawful. Given these legal principles, Myers'
interstate travel from Texas to Oklahoma, coupled with the subsequent
preparation of fraudulent documents and coordination of fund transfers,
satisfies the elements of the Travel Act and can properly serve as a
predicate act for RICO purposes.

Background and Relevant Law
Legislation
The Travel Act, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1952, prohibits interstate travel or
use of interstate facilities with the intent to facilitate unlawful activity. The
statute provides:
"Whoever travels in interstate or foreign commerce or uses the mail or any
facility in interstate or foreign commerce, with intent to... otherwise
promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion,
management, establishment, or carrying on, of any unlawful activity, and
thereafter performs or attempts to perform... shall be fined under this title,
imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both." 18 U.S.C. § 1952 (2025)
This legislation was designed to address the issue of organized crime
operating across state lines and to provide federal authorities with tools to
combat such activities. The Act recognizes that the interstate nature of
certain criminal enterprises creates unique challenges for state law
enforcement agencies, thus warranting federal intervention.
Judicial Interpretation of the Travel Act
Elements of a Travel Act Violation
The courts have consistently interpreted the Travel Act as requiring three
essential elements. In U.S. v. Millet, 123 F.3d 268 (5th Cir. 1997), the Fifth
Circuit held that to obtain a conviction under the Travel Act, the government
must prove: "(1) travel in interstate or foreign commerce; (2) with the intent
to; (3) otherwise promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the
promotion, management, establishment, or carrying on, of any unlawful
activity; and (4) thereafter performs or attempts to perform [an act
described in element 3]."
Similarly, in U.S. v. Briggs, 700 F.2d 408 (7th Cir. 1983), the Seventh Circuit
explained that "a defendant may properly be charged and convicted of
committing a substantive violation of the Travel Act in three separate and
distinct ways: (1) by traveling interstate with the intent to violate state law;
or (2) by using an interstate facility (i.e. telephone, mail) with the intent to
violate state law, or (3) by causing another to use an interstate facility or
travel interstate with an intent to violate state law."
The Supreme Court, in Perrin v. United States, 444 U.S. 37, 100 S.Ct. 311,
62 L.Ed.2d 199 (1979), affirmed the broad application of the Travel Act,
noting that it applies to various forms of unlawful activity. It's worth noting
that this case superseded U.S. v. Perrin, 580 F.2d 730 (5th Cir. 1978), which
had been decided by the Fifth Circuit before the Supreme Court's review.
In United States v. Nardello, 393 U.S. 286, 89 S.Ct. 534, 21 L.Ed.2d 487
(1969), the Supreme Court explained the purpose of the Travel Act, noting
that it was "primarily designed to stem the 'clandestine flow of profits' and

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
to be of 'material assistance to the States in combating pernicious
undertakings which cross State lines,'" reflecting "a congressional judgment
that certain activities of organized crime which were violative of state law
had become a national problem."
Interstate Travel Requirement
The interstate travel element of the Travel Act is satisfied when a defendant
crosses state lines. Grimes v. United States, 379 F.2d 791 (5th Cir. 1967)
cited the statutory language requiring travel in interstate commerce,
confirming that crossing state lines satisfies this requirement.
In U.S. v. Kendall, 766 F.2d 1426 (10th Cir. 1985), the Tenth Circuit clarified
that the defendant need not have direct knowledge of the interstate means,
as long as interstate travel was reasonably foreseeable and connected to the
unlawful activity. The court stated, "There is no requirement in the Travel
Act that a defendant or co-conspirator have knowledge of the intended
interstate means."
Intent Requirement
The Travel Act requires that the interstate travel be undertaken with the
intent to promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate unlawful activity. 
U.S. v. Esposito, 771 F.2d 283 (7th Cir. 1985) quoted the Travel Act's
language specifying that a defendant must travel interstate "with intent to...
otherwise promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion,
management, establishment, or carrying on, of any unlawful activity."
Subsequent Performance Requirement
A crucial element of the Travel Act is that after the interstate travel, the
defendant must perform or attempt to perform an act in furtherance of the
unlawful activity. U.S. v. Admon, 940 F.2d 1121 (8th Cir. 1991) stated that a
"Travel Act violation requires some overt act in furtherance of the unlawful
activity subsequent to the travel... although government must show 'some
conduct after the travel in furtherance of the unlawful activity,' such conduct
need not itself be unlawful."
No Requirement for Completion of Unlawful Activity
It is well-established that the Travel Act does not require proof that the
underlying unlawful activity was actually accomplished. U.S. v. Pomponio,
511 F.2d 953 (4th Cir. 1975) explicitly stated, "Proof that the unlawful
objective was accomplished or that the referenced law has actually been
violated is not a necessary element of the offense defined in section 1952."
Similarly, U.S. v. Millet, 123 F.3d 268 (5th Cir. 1997) clarified that "under the
principles of federalism, the federal courts may not assume jurisdiction over
state offenses. Therefore, it clearly follows that if a state law offense were to
serve as the underlying 'unlawful activity' for the Travel Act and the law is to

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
supplement state law rather than burden it, there can be no requirement for
a conviction of the underlying unlawful activity."
Casual vs. Continuous Involvement
While some cases have addressed the question of whether the Travel Act
applies to casual or sporadic criminal activity, U.S. v. Corbin, 662 F.2d 1066
(4th Cir. 1981) noted that "involvement in a business enterprise may be
integral even though limited to one instance." The court referenced United
States v. Bergdoll, 412 F.Supp. 1308 (D.Del.1976), which held that "limited,
first-time involvement in massive operation to import and distribute
marijuana cannot be characterized as casual."
In United States v. Bergdoll, 412 F.Supp. 1308 (D. Del. 1976), the court
emphasized that for the Travel Act to apply, "The alleged conduct shows a
profit or business purpose and the scope of the endeavor certainly warrants
calling it an enterprise."
Use of Interstate Facilities
While the primary focus for this analysis is on interstate travel, it's worth
noting that the Travel Act also prohibits the use of interstate facilities to
promote or facilitate unlawful activity. In U.S. v. Baker, 82 F.3d 273 (8th Cir.
1996), the court stated, "it is enough that the interstate travel or the use of
interstate facilities makes easier or facilitates the unlawful activity."
Analysis of Myers' Conduct Under the Travel
Act
Interstate Travel
Based on the facts provided, Myers traveled from Texas to Oklahoma, clearly
satisfying the interstate travel element of the Travel Act. As noted in Grimes
v. United States, 379 F.2d 791 (5th Cir. 1967), crossing state lines fulfills this
requirement.
Intent to Facilitate Unlawful Activity
The facts indicate that Myers traveled interstate "to meet with Branthoover,
where they prepared fraudulent legal documents and coordinated the
transfer of marital funds." This suggests that the purpose of Myers' travel
was to facilitate unlawful activity, specifically fraud related to legal
documents and the improper transfer of marital funds.
Under U.S. v. Esposito, 771 F.2d 283 (7th Cir. 1985), the Travel Act requires
intent to "promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate" unlawful
activity. Myers' travel to Oklahoma for the express purpose of preparing
fraudulent documents and coordinating improper fund transfers
demonstrates the requisite intent to facilitate unlawful activity.

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Subsequent Performance of Acts in Furtherance of
Unlawful Activity
After traveling interstate, Myers engaged in specific acts that furthered the
unlawful activity, namely the preparation of fraudulent legal documents and
coordination of the transfer of marital funds. These actions satisfy the
requirement outlined in U.S. v. Admon, 940 F.2d 1121 (8th Cir. 1991) that
there be "some overt act in furtherance of the unlawful activity subsequent
to the travel."
Importantly, U.S. v. Admon, 940 F.2d 1121 (8th Cir. 1991) also clarified that
the conduct following the travel "need not itself be unlawful" as long as it
furthers the unlawful activity. Here, even if some aspects of preparing legal
documents or coordinating fund transfers might, in isolation, appear lawful,
these acts furthered the allegedly fraudulent scheme and thus satisfy this
element.
No Requirement for Completion of Fraud
Even if Myers and Branthoover did not successfully complete their
fraudulent scheme or achieve their ultimate objective, the Travel Act
violation would still stand. As U.S. v. Pomponio, 511 F.2d 953 (4th Cir. 1975)
established, "Proof that the unlawful objective was accomplished or that the
referenced law has actually been violated is not a necessary element of the
offense defined in section 1952."
Similarly, U.S. v. Millet, 123 F.3d 268 (5th Cir. 1997) clarified that there is
"no requirement for a conviction of the underlying unlawful activity."
Therefore, even without proof that the fraud was successfully completed or
that Myers was convicted of fraud under state law, the Travel Act violation
can be established.
Casual vs. Continuous Involvement
While the facts do not indicate whether Myers' fraudulent activities were
part of a continuous pattern or an isolated incident, U.S. v. Corbin, 662 F.2d
1066 (4th Cir. 1981) noted that "involvement in a business enterprise may
be integral even though limited to one instance." The court referenced 
United States v. Bergdoll, 412 F.Supp. 1308 (D.Del.1976), which held that
even "limited, first-time involvement" in a criminal operation can fall under
the Travel Act if the operation has a profit or business purpose.
Given that the fraudulent activities involved the preparation of legal
documents and the transfer of funds, they appear to have a business-like
purpose, thus satisfying this aspect of the Travel Act even if Myers'
involvement was limited to this single instance.
Connection to RICO
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) requires
proof of a pattern of racketeering activity, which consists of at least two

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
predicate acts. The Travel Act (18 U.S.C. § 1952) is one of the enumerated
predicate acts under RICO.
Given that Myers' conduct satisfies all the elements of a Travel Act violation
—interstate travel with the intent to facilitate unlawful activity, followed by
acts in furtherance of that activity—this violation can serve as a predicate
act for RICO purposes.
In United States v. Fernandez, 722 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2013), the court noted
that a Travel Act charge must identify an unlawful purpose for the travel,
and that the Travel Act covers "racketeering"—a term that encompasses
various types of unlawful activity. This further supports the conclusion that
Myers' Travel Act violation can serve as a RICO predicate.
Exceptions and Caveats
Scope of "Unlawful Activity"
While the Travel Act covers a broad range of unlawful activities, including
fraud, it's important to note that the specific unlawful activity must be
clearly identified. In this case, the unlawful activity appears to be fraud
related to the preparation of fraudulent legal documents and the improper
transfer of marital funds.
Nexus Between Interstate Travel and Unlawful Activity
There must be a clear nexus between the interstate travel and the unlawful
activity. As noted in U.S. v. Baker, 82 F.3d 273 (8th Cir. 1996), the interstate
travel cannot be "merely incidental" to the unlawful activity but must make
it "easier or facilitate" the unlawful activity.
In this case, Myers' travel to Oklahoma appears to have facilitated the
preparation of fraudulent documents and coordination of fund transfers with
Branthoover, establishing the necessary nexus.
State Law Violations
Although U.S. v. Millet, 123 F.3d 268 (5th Cir. 1997) clarified that there is no
requirement for a conviction of the underlying unlawful activity, the
government would still need to establish that the alleged fraudulent
activities constituted violations of applicable state or federal law.
Conclusion
Based on the legal materials provided, Myers' conduct of traveling from
Texas to Oklahoma to meet with Branthoover for the purpose of preparing
fraudulent legal documents and coordinating the transfer of marital funds
satisfies all the elements of the Travel Act (18 U.S.C. § 1952).

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
First, by traveling from Texas to Oklahoma, Myers engaged in interstate
travel, satisfying the first element of the Travel Act.
Second, the fact that Myers traveled to Oklahoma specifically to prepare
fraudulent legal documents and coordinate the improper transfer of marital
funds demonstrates the intent to promote or facilitate unlawful activity,
namely fraud, thus satisfying the intent requirement.
Third, after traveling interstate, Myers actually engaged in the preparation
of fraudulent documents and coordination of fund transfers, constituting
acts in furtherance of the unlawful activity and satisfying the subsequent
performance requirement.
As established by U.S. v. Pomponio, 511 F.2d 953 (4th Cir. 1975) and U.S. v.
Millet, 123 F.3d 268 (5th Cir. 1997), it is not necessary to prove that Myers
successfully completed the fraud or was convicted of fraud under state law;
the Travel Act violation is complete upon interstate travel with the requisite
intent, followed by an act in furtherance of the unlawful activity.
Even if Myers' involvement was limited to this single instance, U.S. v.
Corbin, 662 F.2d 1066 (4th Cir. 1981) and United States v. Bergdoll, 412
F.Supp. 1308 (D.Del.1976) suggest that the Travel Act can still apply if the
activity has a business-like purpose, which the preparation of fraudulent
legal documents and coordination of fund transfers appears to have.
Given that Myers' conduct satisfies all elements of a Travel Act violation,
this violation can properly serve as a predicate act for RICO purposes, as the
Travel Act is one of the enumerated predicate acts under RICO.
In conclusion, the proposition that "Myers' interstate travel for the purpose
of preparing and executing fraudulent legal and financial acts satisfies the
Travel Act, providing another RICO predicate" is well-supported by the
relevant legislation and case law.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
Kendall does not dispute that Callihan traveled in interstate commerce with
the intent to perform or facilitate unlawful activity, or that Callihan later
performed an illegal act... The evidence supports a reasonable inference that
Kendall, knowing that Geittmann did not live in Oklahoma at the time of the
introduction, could reasonably have known or anticipated that Callihan and
Geittmann would have to meet to arrange the details of the smuggling trip
and that interstate travel for this purpose was very likely. There is no
requirement in the Travel Act that a defendant or co-conspirator have
knowledge of the intended interstate means.

Summary
The passage from U.S. v. Kendall discusses the application of the Travel Act,
specifically addressing the requirement of interstate travel with the intent to
facilitate unlawful activity. It highlights that the defendant does not need to
have direct knowledge of the interstate travel, as long as the travel was
reasonably foreseeable and connected to the unlawful activity. This supports
the proposition that Myers' travel from Texas to Oklahoma to engage in
fraudulent activities could satisfy the Travel Act's requirements, as the
travel was likely intended to facilitate the unlawful acts.
United States v. Nardello, 393 U.S. 286, 89 S.Ct. 534, 21 L.Ed.2d 487 (1969)

The Travel Act, primarily designed to stem the 'clandestine flow of profits'
and to be of 'material assistance to the States in combating pernicious
undertakings which cross State lines,' thus reflects a congressional
judgment that certain activities of organized crime which were violative of
state law had become a national problem. ... § 1952 imposes penalties upon
any individual crossing state lines or using interstate facilities for any of the
statutorily enumerated offenses.
Summary
The Travel Act was designed to address activities that cross state lines and
violate state laws, reflecting a national concern over organized crime. The
Act imposes penalties on individuals who engage in interstate travel or use
interstate facilities to commit or facilitate unlawful activities, which can
include fraud and theft. This aligns with the proposition that Myers'
interstate travel for fraudulent purposes falls under the purview of the
Travel Act.

merely incidental to Baker's unlawful activity... 'it is enough that the
interstate travel or the use of interstate facilities makes easier or facilitates
the unlawful activity.' United States v. Perrin, 580 F.2d 730, 736 (5th Cir.
1978), aff'd, 444 U.S. 37, 100 S.Ct. 311, 62 L.Ed.2d 199 (1979). Baker's
unlawful conduct falls squarely within the literal language of the Travel Act.
Summary
The passage from "U.S. v. Baker" illustrates the application of the Travel Act,
18 U.S.C. § 1952, to situations where interstate facilities are used to
facilitate unlawful activities. The court found that Baker's use of an
interstate ATM facility to extort money was sufficient to satisfy the Travel
Act's requirements. This supports the proposition that Myers' interstate
travel to prepare and execute fraudulent acts could similarly satisfy the
Travel Act, as the travel facilitated the unlawful activity.

Summary
The passage from "Perrin v. United States" discusses the Travel Act's
prohibition on interstate travel or use of interstate facilities with the intent
to promote or facilitate unlawful activities. This aligns with the proposition
that Myers' interstate travel for fraudulent purposes falls under the Travel
Act. The case clarifies that the Travel Act covers a broad range of unlawful
activities, not limited to public bribery, and includes private acts of fraud
and theft, which are relevant to Myers' actions.
U.S. v. Admon, 940 F.2d 1121 (8th Cir. 1991)

Travel Act violation requires some overt act in furtherance of the unlawful

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
For a Travel Act violation to be established, there must be some conduct in
furtherance of the unlawful activity after the interstate travel. This conduct
does not need to be unlawful itself, but it must further the illegal activity. In
the case of Myers, his travel from Texas to Oklahoma and subsequent
preparation of fraudulent legal documents and coordination of fund
transfers would constitute acts in furtherance of unlawful activity, thus
satisfying the Travel Act requirements.
U.S. v. Pomponio, 511 F.2d 953 (4th Cir. 1975)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fourth Circuit
Extract
Proof that the unlawful objective was accomplished or that the referenced
law has actually been violated is not a necessary element of the offense
defined in section 1952. See United States v. Rizzo, 418 F.2d 71 (7 Cir.
1969); McIntosh v. United States, 385 F.2d 274 (8 Cir. 1967). Accordingly,
we find it sufficient that the indictment charged the defendants with
interstate travel with the intent, inter alia, to facilitate the violation of the
federal statute by Zneimer.
Summary
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1952, it is not necessary to prove that the unlawful
objective was accomplished, only that there was intent to facilitate unlawful
activity through interstate travel. This supports the proposition that Myers'
travel with the intent to engage in fraudulent activities satisfies the
requirements of the Travel Act.

Summary
Specific provisions of the Travel Act, which align with the proposition that
Myers' interstate travel for fraudulent purposes could constitute a violation
of this statute. The passage directly supports the notion that such travel,
when linked to unlawful activities like fraud, falls under the purview of the
Travel Act.

Summary
The passage from the Grimes v. United States case references 18 U.S.C. §
1952, which prohibits interstate travel with the intent to promote or
facilitate unlawful activities. This directly supports the proposition that
Myers' interstate travel for fraudulent purposes falls under the Travel Act.
The statute's language about promoting or facilitating unlawful activity
aligns with the actions described in the proposition, where Myers traveled to
prepare and execute fraudulent acts.

Although the Travel Act does not reach casual, sporadic involvement in
criminal activity, see Rewis v. United States, 401 U.S. 808, 91 S.Ct. 1056, 28
L.Ed.2d 493 (1971), involvement in a business enterprise may be integral
even though limited to one instance. We simply do not address the question.
Cf. United States v. Cozzetti, 441 F.2d 344, 348 (9th Cir. 1971) (fact that
operation may appear casual and sporadic because it was terminated after a
short time does not remove operation from § 1952 where operation was

Summary
Applicability of the Travel Act to activities that may appear casual or
sporadic but are part of a business enterprise intended to be profitable. It
suggests that even limited or first-time involvement in a criminal operation
can fall under the Travel Act if the operation is intended to be profitable or
is part of a larger scheme. This supports the proposition that Myers' travel
to prepare and execute fraudulent acts, even if it was a single instance,
could satisfy the Travel Act's requirements because it was part of a scheme
to commit fraud.
U.S. v. Millet, 123 F.3d 268 (5th Cir. 1997)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
To obtain a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 1952 (Travel Act), as it applies to
the instant case, the government had to prove the following elements
beyond a reasonable doubt: 1) travel in interstate or foreign commerce; 2)
with the intent to; 3) otherwise promote, manage, establish, carry on, or
facilitate the promotion, management, establishment, or carrying on, of any
unlawful activity; and 4) thereafter performs or attempts to perform [an act
described in element 3]. ... It is also well settled that under the principles of
federalism, the federal courts may not assume jurisdiction over state
offenses. Therefore, it clearly follows that if a state law offense were to serve
as the underlying 'unlawful activity' for the Travel Act and the law is to
supplement state law rather than burden it, there can be no requirement for
a conviction of the underlying unlawful activity.
Summary
Elements required to prove a violation of the Travel Act, which include
interstate travel with the intent to promote or facilitate unlawful activity,
and the subsequent performance or attempt to perform such activity. The
passage also clarifies that a conviction for the underlying unlawful activity is
not required, as the Travel Act is meant to supplement state law. This
supports the proposition that Myers' interstate travel for fraudulent
purposes could satisfy the Travel Act requirements.

Extract
Thus, our reading of the statute and case law construing it reveals that a
defendant may properly be charged and convicted of committing a
substantive violation of the Travel Act in three separate and distinct ways:
(1) by traveling interstate with the intent to violate state law; or (2) by using
an interstate facility (i.e. telephone, mail) with the intent to violate state law,
or (3) by causing another to use an interstate facility or travel interstate
with an intent to violate state law, and a criminal defendant violates federal
law when he performs any of the above with the intent to violate state law.
Summary
The passage from "U.S. v. Briggs" clarifies that a defendant can be charged
under the Travel Act if they travel interstate with the intent to violate state
law. This directly supports the proposition that Myers' interstate travel for
the purpose of preparing and executing fraudulent legal and financial acts
could satisfy the Travel Act, as it involves traveling with the intent to engage
in unlawful activity (fraud and theft).
United States v. Fernandez, 722 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2013)
U.S. Court of Appeals — First Circuit
Extract
Count one of the indictment charged Bravo with conspiring with Martínez
and de Castro Font to commit two different crimes: (1) bribery in violation of
§ 666 and (2) traveling in interstate commerce in violation of 18 U.S.C. §
1952 (“the Travel Act”). A Travel Act charge must identify an unlawful
purpose for the travel, and the Travel Act conspiracy alleged against Bravo
specified that his travel was to aid “racketeering”—a term that covers
various types of unlawful activity.
Summary
The Travel Act requires an unlawful purpose for interstate travel, which can
include various types of unlawful activity such as racketeering. The passage
illustrates that a Travel Act charge can be based on interstate travel with
the intent to promote unlawful activities, which aligns with the proposition
that Myers' travel for fraudulent purposes satisfies the Travel Act.

Extract
Congress, in passing the Travel Act, determined that a predicate of federal
jurisdiction is the travel in interstate or foreign commerce or the use of
interstate facilities. ... It is enough for the jury to determine, under a
substantive Travel Act charge, that the defendants, in fact, used interstate
facilities.
Summary
It is sufficient for the jury to determine that the defendants used interstate
facilities, which aligns with the proposition that Myers' interstate travel for
fraudulent purposes satisfies the Travel Act requirements.
United States v. Bergdoll, 412 F.Supp. 1308 (D. Del. 1976)
U.S. District Court — District of Delaware
Extract
Twenty-one of the defendants have been charged with violating 18 U.S.C. §
1952 (the 'Travel Act') by traveling in interstate commerce 'with intent to
promote, manage, or carry on, or to facilitate the promotion, management or
carrying on of an unlawful activity, that is, the distribution or possession of
marihuana with intent to distribute same.' ... The alleged conduct shows a
profit or business purpose and the scope of the endeavor certainly warrants
calling it an enterprise.
Summary
Application of the Travel Act to defendants who traveled interstate with the
intent to promote or facilitate unlawful activities. It highlights that the
conduct must show a profit or business purpose and be part of an
enterprise. This aligns with the proposition that Myers' interstate travel to
prepare and execute fraudulent acts falls under the Travel Act, as it involves
promoting unlawful activity with a business purpose.

thereafter performs or attempts to perform- ... shall be fined under this title,
imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.
Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1952 outlines that interstate travel with the
intent to promote or facilitate unlawful activity, such as fraud, is prohibited
under the Travel Act. The statute specifies that such actions can result in
fines or imprisonment. This directly supports the proposition that Myers'
interstate travel for the purpose of preparing and executing fraudulent legal
and financial acts falls under the purview of the Travel Act, thus providing a
predicate for RICO charges.
