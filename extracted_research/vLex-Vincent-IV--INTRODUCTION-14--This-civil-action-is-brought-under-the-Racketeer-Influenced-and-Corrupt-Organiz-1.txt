Question
IV. INTRODUCTION 14. This civil action is brought under the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1962(c) &
(d), to redress a concerted and malicious campaign of fraud, coercion, and
obstruction perpetrated by Defendants Morgan Michelle Myers (“Myers”)
and Daniel Kenneth Branthoover (“Branthoover”) that began on December
14, 2023, and extends to the current day. Operating as a cohesive
association-in-fact enterprise, these two individuals meticulously devised
and executed an unlawful scheme specifically designed to influence legal
proceedings in an effort to divest Plaintiff of his home, which, inter alia,
served as his primary place of business. 15. Commencing in December 2023,
Defendants engaged in a deliberate and sustained pattern of racketeering
activity. This pattern includes, but is not limited to, acts of mail fraud (18
U.S.C. § 1341), wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343), and repeated acts of
obstruction of justice, each of which constitutes a statutorily enumerated
predicate act under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). These illicit acts were not isolated
incidents; rather, they formed a continuous and interrelated series of
misconduct, demonstrating both a closed-ended and open-ended continuum
of criminal activity that poses a clear and present threat of future criminal
conduct, thereby satisfying RICO’s continuity requirement, as will be
explained in greater detail below. 16. The Defendants’ overarching scheme
was bifurcated into two distinct, yet interconnected, phases: (1) the initial
objective to unlawfully remove Plaintiff from his home by influencing state
court proceedings through the introduction of false information and
fraudulent filings; and (2) the subsequent objective to finalize the divorce
matter between Plaintiff and Defendant Myers, thereby making the unlawful
deprivation of Plaintiff’s property and rights permanent. 17. This scheme
consisted of two phases, and began on December 14, 2023, when Defendant
Branthoover began text communications with Defendant Myers across state
lines. Branthoover acted as Myers’ agent, and specifically invited her to his
residence located within this District over the weekend of December 15
under false pretenses, where he helped her conceal marital assets and
prepare false paperwork that would later be submitted to Texas courts. 18.
The first phase of this scheme achieved its immediate objective on January
16, 2024, when Plaintiff was ordered to vacate his residence by the Texas
State Courts. However, the second phase of the scheme has, against all odds
and due to Plaintiff’s zealous and persistent litigation efforts in state court,
thus far been unable to reach its desired resolution by the Defendants,
leading to multiple threats made against Plaintiff showing a risk of future
criminal activity. 19. Plaintiff seeks damages from this Honorable Court for
the Defendants’ collective and individual actions, specifically under 18
U.S.C. § 1964, which provides for civil remedies for RICO violations. The
specific nature and extent of these damages, including treble damages and
other equitable remedies, will be outlined in further detail in the subsequent
sections of this Complaint. 20. This matter is not a domestic dispute, but
rather an action brought to hold Defendants accountable for their actions by
seeking redress from damages caused by them. V. STATEMENT OF FACTS
21. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations
contained in paragraphs 1 through 20 above, as if fully set forth herein. A.

Party References 22. For clarity and ease of reference throughout this
Complaint, the parties shall be referred to as follows: i. Plaintiff Charles
Dustin Myers shall be referred to herein as “Plaintiff ” and is the husband of
Morgan Michelle Myers. ii. Defendant Daniel Kenneth Branthoover shall be
referred to herein as “Branthoover” and is identified as the stepfather of
Defendant Morgan Michelle Myers. iii. Defendant Morgan Michelle Myers
shall be referred to herein as “Myers” and is identified as the spouse of
Plaintiff Charles Dustin Myers and stepdaughter of Branthoover. 23. At all
relevant times, Defendant Myers has not raised any defenses to these claims
in State court and has ignored all settlement offers made in an attempt to
avoid this lawsuit. 24. At all relevant times, Defendants have maintained
communications regarding the affairs of the enterprise’s purpose. B.
Formation of the Enterprise (December 14 – 15, 2023) 25. Defendant
Branthoover has extensive knowledge of protective orders given his prior
criminal convictions. 26. On December 14, 2023, Defendant Myers opened a
private bank account in her own name and began interstate communications
with Branthoover via text message. In total, Myers and Branthoover
exchanged a total of 92 text messages between Branthoover’s number
registered as 940-312-3434, and Myers’ number registered as
817-235-5189. 27. Also on December 14, 2023, Defendant Myers, without
legitimate cause or factual basis, sought an ex-parte order of protection
against Plaintiff while in communications with Branthoover. 28. Later on the
evening of December 14, 2023, in a stark contrast to her earlier emergency
request for a protective order, Defendant Myers reminded Plaintiff of a
school field trip scheduled for the following day, thereby attempting to
maintain a facade of normalcy and prevent Plaintiff from suspecting of her
fraudulent intentions. C. Deception, Transfer, and Planned Interstate Travel
(December 15–17, 2023) 29. On December 15, 2023, Plaintiff was contacted
by Branthoover at 9:51 A.M. CST, where he stated “I’ve been where you are
before. I want to help both of you” regarding a recent divorce
announcement made by Myers on December 1, 2023. 30. During this phone
conversation, it was established that Myers would visit his residence over
the weekend of December 15, 2023, located within this district, for the
purpose of “providing space” to Myers. 31. At this time, it’s important to
note that Plaintiff had no knowledge of the ex-parte attempt made the day
prior, and he had no reason to believe that Branthoover was being dishonest
about his intentions for Myers’ visit to his residence. 32. Immediately after
the call, Plaintiff received notice that Myers had transferred $1,576 from the
parties’ joint–marital PNC account to Branthoover’s PayPal account
(username “dmb575”), depleting the account’s balance. 33. Both defendants
admit to this transaction occurring. 34. On December 16, 2023, Plaintiff
received notification that the joint marital PNC bank account was overdrawn
by -$800.00. Concurrently, Plaintiff was informed that advertisements
related to his legitimate at-home business had ceased running due to a
failure of payment. 35. The PNC bank statement for December 2023, which
will be presented as Exhibit 10, clearly documents the occurrence of this
fraudulent transaction, demonstrating the precise date and amount of the
unauthorized withdrawal. 36. The PayPal identifier “dmb575” directly
matches the information associated with the fraudulent transfer on
Plaintiff’s bank statement for December of 2023, linking Defendant
Branthoover to the illicit financial maneuver notwithstanding his admission.
37. On December 16, 2023, at precisely 3:54 P.M. Central Standard Time,

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Plaintiff, to mitigate the financial damage and resolve the situation amicably,
sent a text message to Defendant Branthoover. In this message, Plaintiff
explicitly requested the return of the $1,576.00 that had been fraudulently
transferred, detailing the intended use of the funds, the late bills resulting
from misappropriation, his inability to work due to the severe mental
anguish caused by the Defendants’ actions, and his sincere desire for an
amicable resolution given the time of year. 38. In a callous and dismissive
response to Plaintiff’s plea, Defendant Branthoover informed Plaintiff via
text message that “You Are Getting Divorced” and further stated, “I hope I
can help with the paperwork and make things go as smoothly as possible.”
This communication, far from helping as initially stated by Branthoover,
served as a direct threat and an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy,
demonstrating Branthoover’s intent to exploit Plaintiff’s distress for the
benefit of the enterprise. 39. At no time relevant to this Complaint has
Defendant Branthoover possessed a license to practice law in any state
within the United States. In subsequent texts, his statements regarding
“paperwork” and making things “go as smoothly as possible” constituted the
unauthorized practice of law and that he held an administrative role over
the affairs of the enterprise. D. Eviction Attempt Influenced by Myers in
Furtherance of the Scheme (December 17–22, 2023) 40. On December 17,
2023, at approximately 11:00 A.M., Plaintiff was served with an eviction
notice by the grandmother of Myers, which contained the following false
information: i. A purported “lease violation,” which was entirely fabricated
as no valid lease agreement existed between Plaintiff and Wilson; ii. The
assertion that “Granddaughter getting divorced,” referring to Defendant
Myers, as a basis for eviction; iii. The false claim that a “Protective order has
been filed.” iv. The directive that “He must leave. She and the girls may
stay,” demonstrating the clear intent to dispossess Plaintiff for the benefit of
Myers. 41. Defendant Myers was physically present in Oklahoma with
Defendant Branthoover, actively collaborating in the drafting of the very
documents referenced in the frivolous eviction notice, thereby
demonstrating clear premeditation and coordination of the scheme. 42.
Defendant Myers possessed actual knowledge that no valid lease agreement
existed, and on December 17, 2023, Myers herself physically tore the
fraudulent eviction notice in half and wrote “VOID” on the document in
black sharpie, showing her influence over the attempt. E. A Narrative of
Protection, Secondary Phone, and Initiation of Suit 43. Defendant Myers also
returned from Oklahoma with a can of pepper spray mace to further the
narrative of protection first established on December 14, 2023, in her ex-
parte attempt. 44. On the evening of December 17, 2023, Defendant Morgan
Michelle Myers explicitly disclosed to Plaintiff Charles Dustin Myers that she
had acquired a secondary phone number while in Oklahoma, registered
under the number 817-940-0852. This acquisition was a deliberate act of
concealment and an overt act in furtherance of the enterprise, designed to
facilitate clandestine communications related to the fraudulent scheme. 45.
This newly acquired phone number (817-940-0852) was subsequently used
on a series of fraudulent legal documents prepared under the direct
administrative oversight of Defendant Branthoover, with his full knowledge
and participation. These documents, which were prepared in Oklahoma and
designed to unlawfully influence legal proceedings in Texas, included: i. An
“Original Petition for Divorce,” dated December 18, 2023, which contained
numerous false statements. ii. An “Affidavit of Indigency,” dated December

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
18, 2023, which contained material misrepresentations regarding Defendant
Myers’ financial status. iii. A “Request for Uncontested Cases,” dated
December 18, 2023, which was filed despite Plaintiff not conversing with
defendant Myers regarding any divorce litigation. iv. An “Application for
Protective Order,” dated December 22, 2023, which was based on fabricated
allegations of family violence. F. Continued Obstruction and Unauthorized
Practice of Law 46. After the initial divorce paperwork was filed on
December 18, 2023, Defendant Branthoover, continuing his unauthorized
practice of law and his role in the conspiracy, sent a text message to Plaintiff
stating: “Charlie, it’s come to my understanding you have retained an
attorney. I’m sure he has told you that all further communication should take
place between attorneys. I must formally ask you refrain from discussing
details of this case with my client moving forward and only communicate
with me or your attorney.” (emphasis added) This communication was a
deliberate attempt to isolate Plaintiff from direct communication with Myers
and to control the flow of information, thereby hindering Plaintiff’s ability to
uncover the full extent of the fraudulent scheme. This communication also
evidences that Branthoover’s role went beyond helping Myers prepare the
documents by seeing them through to their submission and asserted an
administrative role over the proceedings in an attempt to intimidate
Plaintiff. G. Service by US Marshall 47. In furtherance of the scheme, and
despite still cohabitating with Plaintiff, defendant Myers knowingly and
intentionally utilized the United States Marshall Service to effectuate
service of the misleading documents on Plaintiff, thereby using an
instrumentality of interstate commerce to further the illicit enterprise,
which occurred on December 27, 2023. 48. In furtherance of the scheme,
and despite living next-door to Plaintiff, defendant Myers knowingly and
intentionally influenced an eviction proceeding and utilized the United
States Marshall Service to effectuate service of the misleading documents
on Plaintiff, which occurred on December 28, 2023. H. False Statements –
Divorce Petition and Affidavit of Indigency (Dec. 18, 2023) 49. When
reviewing the documents prepared in part by Branthoover and filed with the
court by Myers, there existed several false statements and were intended to
deceive the court and prejudice Plaintiff in furtherance of the scheme to
dispose him of his property interests. Specifically, these false statements
included, but were not limited to: i. The assertion that the spouses had
ceased living together on December 1, 2023, when in fact they were still
residing together at the marital home on that date and for several weeks
thereafter. ii. The claim that Defendant Myers owned both family vehicles as
her separate property prior to the marriage, which was demonstrably false
as these vehicles were acquired during the marriage and constituted
community property, paid for by Plaintiff. iii. The representation that
Defendant Myers had an active order of protection against Plaintiff with a
judicial finding that family violence had occurred during the marriage, which
was fabricated and without any basis in fact or law. iv. The assertion that the
children or Defendant Myers would be subjected to harassment or abuse if
Plaintiff were provided with her second phone number (817-940-0852)
acquired in Oklahoma, which was a baseless and manipulative claim
designed to conceal her communications related to the fraudulent scheme.
50. Concurrently with the fraudulent divorce petition, Defendant Myers,
again with the administrative oversight and full knowledge of Defendant
Branthoover, filed a fraudulent “Affidavit of Indigency” with the court. This

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
affidavit contained material misrepresentations regarding Defendant Myers’
financial status, all of which were known to be false at the time of filing and
were intended to defraud the court and avoid legitimate court costs.
Specifically, these false statements included, but were not limited to: i. The
claim that Defendant Myers was financially indigent and unable to pay court
costs, despite her access to and control over substantial marital assets. ii.
The representation that Defendant Myers was solely responsible for all
family living expenses, including rent, utilities, food, and other living
expenses, when in fact, Plaintiff was the primary breadwinner of the
household at that time. iii. The assertion that Defendant Myers was solely
responsible for both car payments, which she has no payment history to
support such a claim. I. False Statements – Application for Protective Order
(Dec. 22, 2023) 51. Defendant was served with an Application for a
Protective Order on December 22, 2023, filed by Myers, despite her claim to
already have an existing order in her Original Petition for Divorce. 52. Upon
review, defendant Myers made additional false statements within the sworn
document, all intended to further deceive the court and secure an
unwarranted protective order against Plaintiff to effectuate the enterprises’
goal of divesting him of his property interests. These false statements
included, but were not limited to: i. The claim that family violence occurred
on December 18, 2023, in the presence of the children, which was entirely
false and fabricated. ii. The assertion that family violence occurred prior to
December 18, 2023, which was also false and without any factual basis. iii.
The request that Plaintiff take a battering intervention program. J. A Clear
Objective 53. The common and overarching objectives shared among
Defendant Myers when reviewing these documents (through the
administration and direction of Defendant Branthoover) and with the active
participation of Myers’ grandmother, were multifaceted: primarily, to
unlawfully remove Plaintiff from his residence, which was essential for his
livelihood and the family’s financial well-being; secondarily, to gain an unfair
and illicit advantage in the ongoing divorce proceedings between Plaintiff
and Defendant Myers; and ultimately, to finalize the divorce on terms
unilaterally favorable to Defendant Myers, thereby making the unlawful
deprivation of Plaintiff’s rights and property permanent and to escape
accountability for the conduct alleged herein. K. Primary Objective Success
54. On January 16, 2024, the parties appeared before the 322nd District
Court of Tarrant County, and the initial objective of the Defendants’ scheme
succeeded when Plaintiff was ordered to vacate the family home without any
findings or without a hearing taking place. 55. The significance of the
misinformation presented to the court could have been the only reason for
this decision, and it afforded Myers the advantage that she and Branthoover
had anticipated. K. Pattern of Racketeering Activity and Continuity 56.
Between January 16, 2024, and the present day, Defendants Myers and
Branthoover have continued to further their racketeering activity through a
series of ongoing illicit acts, demonstrating a clear pattern of continuity and
relatedness. These acts include, but are not limited to: i. Myers and
Branthoover continuing to engage in illicit communications regarding case
details between one another across state lines, specifically between Texas
and Oklahoma, in direct furtherance of their fraudulent scheme to see the
divorce through to its’ finalization. ii. Branthoover delivering ongoing
threats and intimidation to Plaintiff regarding his legitimate attempts to
seek legal relief from the orders that were a product of the Defendants’

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
actions, which occurred in December of 2023, June of 2024, December of
2024, and May of 2025. iii. Making direct statements such as “I’ve been
enjoying watching every filing get denied” by Branthoover, showing the
malicious intent behind his involvement. 57. On June 23, 2024, Defendant
Branthoover, continuing his pattern of harassment and intimidation, sent a
text message to Plaintiff stating, “Lol. And here comes another denial,” in
direct reference to a pleading filed in the Texas State courts by Plaintiff
seeking to enjoin Branthoover as a party to the divorce proceedings. This
communication demonstrates Branthoover’s awareness of and continued
involvement in the legal proceedings and his malicious intent to mock
Plaintiff’s efforts to seek justice. 58. On December 12, 2024, Defendant
Branthoover sent a text message to Plaintiff explicitly threatening future
action by stating, “When things all over you get to deal with me. Just a
heads up.” This communication constitutes a direct threat of future harm
and further evidence of the Defendants’ future threat of criminal activity. 59.
On May 24, 2025, Defendant Branthoover sent a text message to Plaintiff
containing a direct and severe threat, stating, “Where’s my lawsuit? Heard
your vm about me. File it. Let’s do this :)” This malicious communication is a
clear act of intimidation and further evidence of the Defendants’
collaboration throughout the proceedings with Defendant Myers.
obstruction of justice only applies to federal proceedings, but these are state
proceedings. is there any way that obstruction of justice can apply here
maybe in a different provision?
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Obstruction of justice in state proceedings can constitute a RICO predicate
act under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B) through 18 U.S.C. § 1511, which specifically
addresses obstruction of state or local law enforcement, or through other
enumerated provisions like witness tampering (18 U.S.C. § 1512) if the
conduct affects interstate commerce.
Summary
When analyzing whether obstruction of justice in state proceedings can
serve as a predicate act for a RICO claim, a careful examination of 18 U.S.C.
§ 1961(1) reveals several possible pathways. The statute explicitly includes
"section 1511 (relating to the obstruction of State or local law enforcement)"
as a predicate act, providing a direct connection between RICO and
obstruction at the state level. Additionally, other enumerated provisions such
as mail fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341), wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343), witness
tampering (18 U.S.C. § 1512), and retaliating against witnesses (18 U.S.C. §
1513) could potentially apply if interstate communications or commerce
were involved in the obstructive conduct.
The specific factual allegations in this case—including interstate text
communications between defendants in Texas and Oklahoma, the
preparation of false legal documents across state lines, fraudulent financial

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
transfers, and the use of the U.S. Marshal Service to effectuate service—
provide multiple grounds for establishing RICO predicate acts. The pattern
of alleged behavior appears to satisfy both closed-ended continuity
(extending from December 2023 through May 2025) and open-ended
continuity (with explicit threats of future harmful conduct). For the RICO
claim to succeed, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendants'
obstructive activities in state court were part of a broader racketeering
scheme with the requisite continuity, enterprise structure, and impact on
interstate commerce.
Background and Relevant Law
Statutory Framework for RICO Claims
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provides
both criminal penalties and civil remedies against individuals who engage in
certain patterns of racketeering activity or the collection of unlawful debt.
The statute allows private individuals to sue for injuries to their business or
property caused by violations of the act's provisions.
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), it is unlawful for "any person employed by or
associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect,
interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt." 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c)
(2025). Additionally, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) prohibits conspiring to violate
subsection (c).
For civil RICO claims, 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) provides that "[a]ny person injured
in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this
chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate United States district court and
shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit,
including a reasonable attorney's fee..." 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) (2025).
Central to any RICO claim is establishing a "pattern of racketeering activity,"
which requires proving at least two acts of "racketeering activity" as defined
in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). This definition encompasses various federal and state
crimes, including:
"As used in this chapter- ... section 1503 (relating to obstruction of justice),
section 1510 (relating to obstruction of criminal investigations), section
1511 (relating to the obstruction of State or local law enforcement), section
1512 (relating to tampering with a witness, victim, or an informant), section
1513 (relating to retaliating against a witness, victim, or an informant)..." 18
U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B) (2025).
Notably, the explicit inclusion of "section 1511 (relating to the obstruction of
State or local law enforcement)" in the definition of racketeering activity
directly addresses the question of whether obstruction of justice in state
proceedings can serve as a predicate act under RICO.

Requirements for Obstruction of Justice as a RICO
Predicate
For an offense to qualify as obstruction of justice under RICO, it must
involve "the affirmative and intentional attempt, with specific intent, to
interfere with the process of justice." In re Cordero-Garcia, 27 I&N Dec. 652
(2019) ("We subsequently clarified our prior precedents interpreting section
101(a)(S) of the Act and held that an offense relating to obstruction of
justice must have as an element 'the affirmative and intentional attempt,
with specific intent, to interfere with the process of justice.'").
Importantly, this administrative decision also clarified that "the existence of
[an ongoing criminal investigation or trial] is not an essential element of 'an
offense relating to obstruction of justice.'" In re Cordero-Garcia, 27 I&N
Dec. 652 (2019). This interpretation broadens the potential application of
obstruction of justice as a predicate act.
Additionally, 18 U.S.C. § 1512, which relates to tampering with witnesses,
victims, or informants, provides that:
"Whoever knowingly uses intimidation, threatens, or corruptly persuades
another person, or attempts to do so, or engages in misleading conduct
toward another person, with intent to- influence, delay, or prevent the
testimony of any person in an official proceeding; cause or induce any
person to- (A) withhold testimony, or withhold a record, document, or other
object, from an official proceeding; (B) alter, destroy, mutilate, or conceal an
object with intent to impair the object's integrity or availability for use in an
official proceeding; (C) evade legal process summoning that person to
appear as a witness, or to produce a record, document, or other object, in an
official proceeding; or (D) be absent from an official proceeding to which
such person has been summoned by legal process... shall be fined under this
title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both." 18 U.S.C. § 1512
(2025).
This provision could potentially apply to actions taken to impede state court
proceedings if they involve interstate elements.
Requirements for Establishing a Pattern of Racketeering
Activity
To establish a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO, a plaintiff must
demonstrate both "relatedness" of the predicate acts and "continuity" of the
criminal activity.
Continuity can be established through either:
"Closed-ended continuity" - Proving "a series of related predicate acts
extending over a substantial period of time."
"Open-ended continuity" - A threat of "continuing criminal activity
extending indefinitely into the future," in light of the nature of the
enterprise and predicate acts alleged.

RICO: A Primer (2022) ("A plaintiff may demonstrate a pattern by
establishment that the predicate acts pose a threat of continued criminal
activity, which is generally demonstrated by showing either: * Closed-ended
continuity. Proving 'a series of related predicate acts extending over a
substantial period of time.' * Open-ended continuity. A threat of 'continuing
criminal activity extending indefinitely into the future,' in light of the nature
of the enterprise and predicate acts alleged.").
Territorial Application of RICO
While RICO's application is primarily territorial, it can encompass conduct
that occurs within the United States, even if it involves entities or
individuals from different states. As explained in Santos v. Delta Airlines,
Inc. (2013):
"In contrast, the district court in Chevron Corp. took a different approach
when considering a RICO claim that involved a scheme formulated
predominantly by Americans to extort funds from Chevron Corp. (a U.S.
Company) through 'a pattern of racketeering activity that included acts in
the United States by Americans as well as acts in Ecuador by both
Americans and Ecuadorians.'... After finding that RICO applies only to
territorial claims, the court moved on to the second step of the Morrison
test. The court first paused to explain that limiting RICO's reach to 'purely
domestic enterprises' is not a workable approach because 'foreign
enterprises have been at the heart of precisely the sort of activities—
committed in the United States—that were exactly what Congress enacted
RICO to eradicate.'"
This interpretation supports the application of RICO to activities that occur
across state lines, such as between Texas and Oklahoma in the present case.
Venue for RICO Prosecutions
For offenses that span multiple districts, 18 U.S.C. § 3237 provides:
"Except as otherwise expressly provided by enactment of Congress, any
offense against the United States begun in one district and completed in
another, or committed in more than one district, may be inquired of and
prosecuted in any district in which such offense was begun, continued, or
completed. Any offense involving the use of the mails, transportation in
interstate or foreign commerce, or the importation of an object or person
into the United States is a continuing offense and, except as otherwise
expressly provided by enactment of Congress, may be inquired of and
prosecuted in any district from, through, or into which such commerce, mail
matter, or imported object or person moves." 18 U.S.C. § 3237 (2025).
This provision supports jurisdiction for RICO cases involving interstate
activities, such as the cross-state communications and actions alleged in the
present case.

Analysis
Application of Obstruction of Justice Provisions to State
Proceedings
The central question is whether obstruction of justice in state proceedings
can serve as a predicate act for a RICO claim. Based on the statutory
framework, there are several viable pathways for such an application:
Section 1511 - Obstruction of State or Local Law Enforcement:
18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B) explicitly includes "section 1511 (relating to the
obstruction of State or local law enforcement)" as a predicate act. This
direct reference to obstruction at the state level provides the clearest
path for considering state-level obstruction as a RICO predicate act.
Mail Fraud and Wire Fraud:
The facts indicate that the defendants used interstate communications
(92 text messages between Texas and Oklahoma) and potentially mail
services (through the U.S. Marshal Service for document service) in
furtherance of their scheme. These activities could constitute mail
fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341) or wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343), both of which
are enumerated predicate acts under RICO.
Witness Tampering and Intimidation:
The allegations include multiple instances of threatening messages
from Branthoover to the plaintiff, such as "When things all over you get
to deal with me. Just a heads up." These communications could
potentially qualify as witness intimidation or tampering under 18 U.S.C.
§ 1512, which is also an enumerated RICO predicate.
Interstate Nature of the Enterprise:
The fact that the activities took place across state lines (Texas and
Oklahoma) with document preparation in one state for filing in another
brings the conduct within the realm of interstate commerce, a
jurisdictional requirement for RICO. As noted in 18 U.S.C. § 3237
(2025), offenses involving interstate commerce "may be inquired of and
prosecuted in any district from, through, or into which such commerce,
mail matter, or imported object or person moves."
Establishing a Pattern of Racketeering Activity
The allegations in the complaint describe numerous acts that could qualify
as predicate acts under RICO, occurring from December 2023 through May
2025. These include:
Interstate communications to coordinate fraudulent activities
Fraudulent transfer of $1,576 from a joint bank account
Preparation and filing of false legal documents
Using the U.S. Marshal Service to effectuate service despite
cohabitation
Multiple threatening communications to intimidate the plaintiff

These alleged activities appear to satisfy the requirement for a pattern of
racketeering activity in two ways:
Closed-ended continuity: The activities extended over a substantial
period (December 2023 to May 2025), well beyond the minimum
required to establish a pattern.
Open-ended continuity: The explicit threats in the messages from
December 2024 and May 2025 suggest an ongoing threat of criminal
activity extending into the future.
As explained in RICO: A Primer (2022), "A plaintiff may demonstrate a
pattern by establishment that the predicate acts pose a threat of continued
criminal activity," which can be shown through either closed-ended or open-
ended continuity. The allegations in this case appear to satisfy both
approaches.
RICO Application in Divorce Cases
The application of RICO to divorce proceedings, while uncommon, is not
unprecedented. As noted in Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations
(2007):
"Within the field of family law, civil RICO claims have been attempted in
divorce cases, but most plaintiffs have been unsuccessful. However, a claim
by a woman that her ex-husband, along with the other defendants,
participated in a fraudulent scheme to conceal the true value of his income
during the couple's divorce proceedings has twice survived motions for
summary judgment. At least one commentator believes it is possible for a
RICO action to be successfully litigated in the area of divorce if it meets the
following criteria: (i) the plaintiff must show an injury to business or
property because of the divorce proceedings; (ii) the plaintiff must show that
the defendant acted as part of an enterprise to further the act of hiding
assets to minimize divorce settlements; and (iii) there must be either
multiple violations of the same predicate act, or the commission of more
than one predicate act."
The current case appears to satisfy these criteria: (i) the plaintiff alleges
injury to his property through loss of his home which also served as his
primary place of business, (ii) the defendants allegedly acted as an
enterprise to fraudulently influence court proceedings, and (iii) multiple
predicate acts are alleged, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction.
Pleading Requirements for RICO Claims
For a RICO claim to succeed, the plaintiff must plead with specificity the
predicate acts that form the pattern of racketeering activity. As highlighted
in Xenos Yuen v. Triple B Servs. LLP, CIVIL ACTION NO. H-18-3277 (S.D.
Tex. Jun 08, 2019):
"Defendants argue, in their respective Motions to Dismiss, that Plaintiff's
RICO claim is not plausible because Plaintiff has not pled any predicate acts
1. 
2. 

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
of racketeering, has not alleged that Defendants derived income from a
pattern of racketeering, has not alleged how Defendants were part of any
enterprise that was engaged in interstate commerce, and has not alleged
how Plaintiff's alleged injury is related to any specific RICO violation...
Predicate acts supporting a civil RICO claim, which are based on allegations
of fraud, must meet the pleading requirements of FED. R. CIV. P. 9(b)."
The plaintiff's complaint appears to address these requirements by
specifically alleging predicate acts of mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction
of justice, detailing how the defendants operated as an enterprise, how their
activities affected interstate commerce, and how the plaintiff's injuries
resulted from the pattern of racketeering activity.
Demonstrating Injury and Causation
For a civil RICO claim, the plaintiff must demonstrate injury to business or
property "by reason of" the RICO violation. As explained in Jones v.
Enterprise Rent a Car Co. of Texas, 187 F.Supp.2d 670 (S.D. Tex. 2002):
"In previous employee discharge cases, the appellate courts have
occasionally hinted at the idea that a plaintiff could recover under § 1964(c)
for a loss of employment that was directly caused by a RICO scheme. In
Nodine, for example, the plaintiff claimed that he was discharged for
refusing to disavow knowledge of his employer's RICO violations, rather
than for refusing to cooperate in the alleged scheme. This conduct,
according to the plaintiff, amounted to an obstruction of a criminal
investigation by bribery under 18 U.S.C. § 1510, also a predicate offense
under RICO."
In the present case, the plaintiff alleges direct injury through loss of his
residence, which also served as his primary place of business, as a direct
result of the defendants' fraudulent scheme. This appears to establish the
required causation between the alleged RICO violations and the plaintiff's
injuries.
Elements of a RICO Conspiracy
The complaint also alleges a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), which prohibits
conspiracy to violate RICO. As outlined in Bonton v. Archer Chrysler
Plymouth, Inc., 889 F.Supp. 995 (S.D. Tex. 1995):
"A conspiracy to violate RICO is comprised of three elements: (1) knowledge
by the defendant of the essential nature of the conspiracy; (2) the
defendant's objective manifestation of an agreement to participate in the
conduct of the affairs of an enterprise; and (3) an overt act, which need not
be a crime, in furtherance of the conspiracy."
The allegations in the complaint, including the coordinated interstate
communications, the preparation of false documents, and the execution of a
two-phase scheme to deprive the plaintiff of his property, appear to satisfy
these elements of a RICO conspiracy.

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Racketeering Injury Requirement
Some courts have adopted a requirement that plaintiffs in RICO cases must
establish a "racketeering injury" that goes beyond the harm caused by the
predicate acts themselves. As expressed in Mitchell Energy Corp. v. Martin,
616 F.Supp. 924 (S.D. Tex. 1985):
"RICO was intended not simply to provide additional remedies for already
compensable injuries, but rather to provide added remedies and procedures
to fight certain specific kinds of organized criminality... The 'by reason of'
language, therefore, requires that plaintiffs allege injury caused by an
activity which RICO was designed to deter, which, whatever it may be, is
different from that caused simply by such predicate acts as are alleged
here."
The plaintiff's allegations appear to address this requirement by
demonstrating an injury (loss of home and business location) caused by a
coordinated scheme of racketeering activity (fraudulent legal filings and
interstate coordination) that RICO was designed to deter.
Predicate Acts Under RICO
For an act to qualify as a RICO predicate, it must fall within the specific
categories enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). As noted in Heden v. Hill, 937
F.Supp. 1230 (S.D. Tex. 1996):
"Under § 1961(1)(B), racketeering activity includes any act which is
indictable under a number of federal criminal statutes, including mail fraud
and wire fraud. Any act that does not fall within the purview of RICO's
definition of predicate offenses is not an act of 'racketeering activity.'"
The plaintiff's allegations include multiple acts that fall within the
enumerated categories, including mail fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341), wire fraud
(18 U.S.C. § 1343), and obstruction of state law enforcement (18 U.S.C. §
1511).
Exceptions and Caveats
Jurisdictional Requirements and Interstate Commerce
For a RICO claim to succeed, the enterprise must engage in, or its activities
must affect, interstate commerce. The interstate communications between
Texas and Oklahoma, the preparation of documents in Oklahoma for filing in
Texas, and the use of the U.S. Marshal Service to effectuate service appear
to satisfy this requirement.
However, if the plaintiff cannot establish that the enterprise's activities
affected interstate commerce, the RICO claim could fail on jurisdictional
grounds. This is a factual question that would need to be proven with
evidence.

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Pleading Specificity for Fraud-Based Predicates
As highlighted in Xenos Yuen v. Triple B Servs. LLP, CIVIL ACTION NO.
H-18-3277 (S.D. Tex. Jun 08, 2019), fraud-based predicate acts must meet
the heightened pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
9(b). The plaintiff will need to plead the alleged mail fraud and wire fraud
with particularity, specifying the who, what, when, where, and how of the
fraud.
Continuity Requirement
While the alleged activities appear to span a substantial period (December
2023 to May 2025), the court will need to evaluate whether the predicate
acts are sufficiently related and continuous to establish a pattern of
racketeering activity. If the court finds that the acts are sporadic or isolated,
rather than part of a continuous pattern, the RICO claim could fail.
Civil RICO in Divorce Context
As noted in Racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations (2007), most
civil RICO claims in divorce cases have been unsuccessful. Courts may be
hesitant to apply RICO to what they perceive as primarily domestic disputes,
even if the technical elements of RICO are met. The plaintiff will need to
emphasize the broader criminal scheme beyond the divorce itself, focusing
on the fraudulent activities and obstruction of justice aspects.
Conclusion
Based on the analysis of relevant statutory provisions and case law,
obstruction of justice in state proceedings can serve as a predicate act for a
RICO claim under several theories:
Section 1511 of Title 18, which relates to obstruction of state or local
law enforcement, is explicitly listed as a predicate act under 18 U.S.C. §
1961(1)(B).
Activities that obstruct state proceedings may also constitute mail fraud
(18 U.S.C. § 1341) or wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343) if they involve
interstate communications or mailings, both of which are enumerated
predicate acts under RICO.
Witness tampering or intimidation under 18 U.S.C. § 1512, which is also
an enumerated RICO predicate, may apply if the defendants' behavior
involved attempting to influence testimony or participation in
proceedings.
The allegations in the complaint—including interstate communications,
fraudulent transfers, false legal filings, and threatening messages—appear
to establish multiple predicate acts that could support a RICO claim. The
pattern of activity from December 2023 through May 2025, with explicit
1. 
2. 
3. 

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
threats of future harmful conduct, seems to satisfy both closed-ended and
open-ended continuity requirements.
For the claim to succeed, however, the plaintiff must overcome several
hurdles:
Demonstrating that the defendants' activities affected interstate
commerce
Pleading the fraud-based predicates with particularity
Establishing a clear causal link between the RICO violations and the
plaintiff's injuries
Overcoming potential judicial reluctance to apply RICO in what might
be perceived as a domestic dispute
While civil RICO claims in divorce cases have historically faced skepticism,
the specific allegations in this case—involving interstate activities,
fraudulent conduct, and threats—may provide a stronger foundation than
typical divorce-related RICO claims. The plaintiff's emphasis on the
commercial aspects of the injury (loss of a home that served as a place of
business) and the broader criminal scheme beyond the divorce itself may
help distinguish this case from unsuccessful precedents.
In conclusion, obstruction of justice in state proceedings can constitute a
RICO predicate act, particularly when it involves interstate elements and is
part of a broader pattern of racketeering activity.
Legal Authorities
Bonton v. Archer Chrysler Plymouth, Inc., 889 F.Supp. 995 (S.D. Tex. 1995)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
A conspiracy to violate RICO is comprised of three elements: (1) knowledge
by the defendant of the essential nature of the conspiracy; (2) the
defendant's objective manifestation of an agreement to participate in the
conduct of the affairs of an enterprise; and (3) an overt act, which need not
be a crime, in furtherance of the conspiracy.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the elements required to establish a
conspiracy under RICO, which includes an overt act that need not be a
crime. This suggests that even if obstruction of justice in state proceedings
is not a crime under federal law, it could still be considered an overt act in
furtherance of a RICO conspiracy if it is part of a pattern of racketeering
activity. Therefore, while obstruction of justice in state proceedings may not
directly apply under federal RICO statutes, it could still be relevant as part
of a broader RICO conspiracy claim.

Jones v. Enterprise Rent a Car Co. of Texas, 187 F.Supp.2d 670 (S.D. Tex.
2002)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
In previous employee discharge cases, the appellate courts have
occasionally hinted at the idea that a plaintiff could recover under § 1964(c)
for a loss of employment that was directly caused by a RICO scheme. In
Nodine, for example, the plaintiff claimed that he was discharged for
refusing to disavow knowledge of his employer's RICO violations, rather
than for refusing to cooperate in the alleged scheme. This conduct,
according to the plaintiff, amounted to an obstruction of a criminal
investigation by bribery under 18 U.S.C. § 1510, also a predicate offense
under RICO. 819 F.2d 347. The First Circuit in that case acknowledged in a
footnote that 'Nodine's allegation of obstruction of a criminal investigation
comes closest to satisfying the injury requirement imposed by Sedima.' Id. at
349 n. 3.
Summary
Obstruction of justice can be considered a predicate act under RICO if it is
part of a pattern of racketeering activity. The passage discusses a case
where obstruction of a criminal investigation by bribery was considered a
predicate offense under RICO. This suggests that if the obstruction of justice
is part of a broader scheme that affects interstate commerce and involves a
pattern of racketeering activity, it could potentially be applicable under
RICO.
Heden v. Hill, 937 F.Supp. 1230 (S.D. Tex. 1996)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
Under § 1961(1)(B), racketeering activity includes any act which is
indictable under a number of federal criminal statutes, including mail fraud
and wire fraud. Any act that does not fall within the purview of RICO's
definition of predicate offenses is not an act of 'racketeering activity.'
Summary
For an act to be considered racketeering activity under RICO, it must be
indictable under specific federal criminal statutes. Obstruction of justice, as
it pertains to federal proceedings, is not explicitly listed as a predicate act
under RICO unless it falls under one of the enumerated federal statutes.
Therefore, if the obstruction of justice in question does not align with these
statutes, it may not qualify as racketeering activity under RICO.

Mitchell Energy Corp. v. Martin, 616 F.Supp. 924 (S.D. Tex. 1985)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
Defendants' next RICO argument concerns the scope of § 1962. Defendants
claim that Plaintiffs' Complaint does not satisfy the requirements of showing
an injury 'by reason of § 1962.' Specifically, Defendants note that some
courts have adopted a requirement that plaintiffs pressing a RICO claim
must establish a so-called 'racketeering injury' in order to have a cause of
action under the statute. As one court recently explained: RICO was
intended not simply to provide additional remedies for already compensable
injuries, but rather to provide added remedies and procedures to fight
certain specific kinds of organized criminality. The 'by reason of' language,
therefore, requires that plaintiffs allege injury caused by an activity which
RICO was designed to deter, which, whatever it may be, is different from
that caused simply by such predicate acts as are alleged here.
Summary
For a RICO claim, it is not enough to simply allege predicate acts like
obstruction of justice; the plaintiff must demonstrate that the injury was
caused by activities that RICO aims to deter. This suggests that while
obstruction of justice in state proceedings might not directly apply under
federal RICO provisions, if it can be shown that such acts are part of a
broader scheme that RICO is designed to combat, it might still be relevant.
Xenos Yuen v. Triple B Servs. LLP, CIVIL ACTION NO. H-18-3277 (S.D. Tex.
Jun 08, 2019)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
Defendants argue, in their respective Motions to Dismiss, that Plaintiff's
RICO claim is not plausible because Plaintiff has not pled any predicate acts
of racketeering, has not alleged that Defendants derived income from a
pattern of racketeering, has not alleged how Defendants were part of any
enterprise that was engaged in interstate commerce, and has not alleged
how Plaintiff's alleged injury is related to any specific RICO violation.
Plaintiff, in response, argues that he has alleged all of the elements of a
RICO claim. The allegations supporting Plaintiff's RICO claim in Plaintiff's
live pleading are sparse, and conclusory, at best. As argued by Defendants,
there are no facts alleged to support the required pleading elements of a
RICO claim. In addition, as is most blatant, there are no facts alleged that
would support a plausible predicate act of racketeering. Despite using the
words 'fraud' and 'fraudulent,' none of Plaintiff's factual allegations support

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
a plausible predicate act of racketeering based on any type of fraud, and
there are no allegations that come close to meeting the heightened pleading
requirements for fraud under FED. R. CIV. P. 9(b). Predicate acts supporting
a civil RICO claim, which are based on allegations of fraud, must meet the
pleading requirements of FED. R. CIV. P. 9(b).
Summary
For a RICO claim to be plausible, the plaintiff must allege specific predicate
acts of racketeering with particularity, especially when those acts are based
on fraud. The passage emphasizes the necessity of meeting the heightened
pleading requirements under FED. R. CIV. P. 9(b) for fraud-based predicate
acts. This suggests that if obstruction of justice is to be considered as a
predicate act under RICO, it must be pled with particularity and must be
applicable under the specific circumstances of the case.

Summary
The passage lists various acts that are considered "racketeering activity"
under the RICO statute, including obstruction of justice (section 1503),
obstruction of criminal investigations (section 1510), and obstruction of
State or local law enforcement (section 1511). This indicates that
obstruction of justice can be considered a predicate act under RICO if it
involves obstructing State or local law enforcement, which may apply to the
state proceedings mentioned in the question.

Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) indicates that it is unlawful for any
person associated with an enterprise engaged in activities affecting
interstate or foreign commerce to conduct or participate in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. This
provision could potentially apply to the situation described in the question if
the defendants' actions are considered part of a pattern of racketeering
activity that affects interstate commerce. The passage does not directly
address obstruction of justice, but it provides a framework for considering
how the defendants' actions might be part of a broader pattern of
racketeering activity under RICO.

Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1964 provides civil remedies for violations of
section 1962, which includes racketeering activities. While the passage does
not directly address obstruction of justice, it does provide a mechanism for
individuals injured by racketeering activities to seek damages. This could
potentially include activities that obstruct justice if they are part of a
broader racketeering scheme. The scope of the material is broad, applying
to any violations of section 1962, which could encompass a range of criminal
activities, including those that might involve obstruction of justice.

Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1512 addresses obstruction of justice in the context of federal
proceedings. It includes actions such as intimidation, threats, or corrupt
persuasion to influence or prevent testimony or communication in an official
proceeding. While the original question pertains to state proceedings, this
provision could apply if the actions were intended to affect a federal
proceeding or communication with federal law enforcement or judges.

Except as otherwise expressly provided by enactment of Congress, any
offense against the United States begun in one district and completed in
another, or committed in more than one district, may be inquired of and
prosecuted in any district in which such offense was begun, continued, or
completed. Any offense involving the use of the mails, transportation in
interstate or foreign commerce, or the importation of an object or person
into the United States is a continuing offense and, except as otherwise
expressly provided by enactment of Congress, may be inquired of and
prosecuted in any district from, through, or into which such commerce, mail
matter, or imported object or person moves.
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 3237 addresses offenses that span multiple districts, including
those involving the use of mails or interstate commerce. This provision
allows for such offenses to be prosecuted in any district where the offense
was begun, continued, or completed. This could potentially apply to the case
in question if the alleged obstruction of justice involved the use of interstate
communications or other elements that cross district lines, thereby making
it a continuing offense under federal jurisdiction.

Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
RICO’s broad definition of racketeering activity and the act’s reference to
mail and wire fraud as predicate offenses begs the question: Why not RICO?
That is, should the plaintiff consider adding a RICO count to an existing
state cause of action? Moreover, since an action under RICO arises under
federal law, a plaintiff can elect to have access to federal court. Civil RICO is
so broad and offers such a potentially broad pathway to pleading of such a
claim in light of the inclusion of mail and wire fraud as predicate acts that a
plaintiff can take almost any given set of facts and fashion their pleadings
and be... RICO’s prohibitions may be enforced in both criminal and civil
contexts. In the context of a civil action, a plaintiff must be directly injured
by reason of the defendant’s racketeering activities. Proximate cause, as an
aspect of RICO’s “by reason of ” standard, requires a RICO plaintiff to show
that the defendant’s racketeering offenses led directly to the plaintiff ’s
injuries.
Summary
Civil RICO claims can be broad and flexible, allowing plaintiffs to
incorporate various predicate offenses, such as mail and wire fraud, into
their claims. The passage suggests that plaintiffs can use RICO to access
federal court and that the statute's broad definition of racketeering activity
can encompass a wide range of misconduct. While the passage does not
specifically address obstruction of justice in state proceedings, it highlights
the potential for using RICO's broad framework to address various forms of
misconduct that affect legal proceedings.

We subsequently clarified our prior precedents interpreting section 101(a)
(S) of the Act and held that an offense relating to obstruction of justice must
have as an element 'the affirmative and intentional attempt, with specific

ongoing criminal investigation or trial] is not an essential element of 'an
offense relating to obstruction of justice.'

=== PAGE 23 ===

Summary
An offense relating to obstruction of justice does not necessarily require an
ongoing investigation or proceeding. Instead, it requires an affirmative and
intentional attempt to interfere with the process of justice. This broader
interpretation could potentially apply to the actions described in the
question, even if they occurred in state proceedings rather than federal
ones.
Santos v. Delta Airlines, Inc.
USDOL Administrative Review Board Decisions
Extract
In contrast, the district court in Chevron Corp. took a different approach
when considering a RICO claim that involved a scheme formulated
predominantly by Americans to extort funds from Chevron Corp. (a U.S.
Company) through 'a pattern of racketeering activity that included acts in
the United States by Americans as well as acts in Ecuador by both
Americans and Ecuadorians.' Chevron Corp., 2012 WL 1711521, at *4. After
finding that RICO applies only to territorial claims, the court moved on to
the second step of the Morrison test. The court first paused to explain that
limiting RICO's reach to 'purely domestic enterprises' is not a workable
approach because 'foreign enterprises have been at the heart of precisely
the sort of activities—committed in the United States—that were exactly
what Congress enacted RICO to eradicate.' Id. at *6 (citations omitted).
Summary
RICO's application is primarily territorial, focusing on the pattern of
racketeering activity. The passage suggests that RICO can apply to activities
that occur within the United States, even if they involve foreign enterprises,
as long as the pattern of racketeering activity is domestic. This implies that
obstruction of justice, as a predicate act under RICO, could potentially apply
if the pattern of racketeering activity, including obstruction, occurs within
the U.S. and affects domestic enterprises or proceedings.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
The heart of a RICO case is the existence of a pattern of racketeering
activity. Under the statute, 'racketeering activity' includes a host of offenses.
Section 1961 defines the phrase to include any crime listed in subdivisions
A, B, C, D, E, F, or G of section 1961... A plaintiff may demonstrate a pattern
by establishment that the predicate acts pose a threat of continued criminal
activity, which is generally demonstrated by showing either: * Closed-ended

continuity. Proving 'a series of related predicate acts extending over a
substantial period of time.' * Open-ended continuity. A threat of 'continuing
criminal activity extending indefinitely into the future,' in light of the nature
of the enterprise and predicate acts alleged.
Summary
The passage explains that a RICO case requires a pattern of racketeering
activity, which can include various offenses as defined in Section 1961.
While obstruction of justice is typically associated with federal proceedings,
the RICO statute allows for a broad interpretation of racketeering activity,
which can include acts that affect interstate commerce. The passage also
highlights the importance of demonstrating continuity and the threat of
ongoing criminal activity, which can be relevant in establishing a RICO claim
even if the underlying acts occur in state proceedings.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
A plaintiff may demonstrate a pattern by establishment that the predicate
acts pose a threat of continued criminal activity, which is generally
demonstrated by showing either: * Closed-ended continuity. Proving 'a series
of related predicate acts extending over a substantial period of time.' *
Open-ended continuity. A threat of 'continuing criminal activity extending
indefinitely into the future,' in light of the nature of the enterprise and
predicate acts alleged.
Summary
The continuity requirement under RICO can be satisfied by demonstrating
either closed-ended or open-ended continuity. This involves showing a series
of related predicate acts over a substantial period or a threat of continuing
criminal activity. While the passage does not directly address obstruction of
justice in state proceedings, it provides insight into how a pattern of
racketeering activity can be established, which may include acts that
influence legal proceedings.

Summary
Obstruction of justice can be considered a RICO predicate act when it is part
of a pattern of racketeering activity. This suggests that even if the primary
proceedings are state-level, if the obstruction is part of a broader scheme
involving other RICO predicate acts, it may still be actionable under RICO.
