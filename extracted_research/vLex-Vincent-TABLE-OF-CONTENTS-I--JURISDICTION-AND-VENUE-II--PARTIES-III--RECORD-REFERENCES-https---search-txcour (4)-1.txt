Plaintiff incorporates by reference public records from the Texas Supreme
Court, and requests the court to take judicial notice of these documents. The
Fifth Circuit has repeatedly held that it is proper for federal courts to take
judicial notice of matters of public record, including documents filed in state
court proceedings (Miller v. Dunn, 35 F.4th 1007 (5th Cir. 2022); LUV N'
Care, Ltd. v. Jackel Int'l Ltd., 502 F.Supp.3d 1106 (W.D. La. 2020); Wright v.
Arlington Indep. Sch. Dist., Civil Action No. 4:19-cv-00278-P (N.D. Tex. Nov
25, 2019)). Plaintiff therefore requests that this Court take judicial
knowledge of the consolidated mandamus record, as its’ authenticity is not
reasonably disputed. Here, all record references point to the public
consolidated mandamus record, as submitted to the Texas Supreme Court, a
copy of which has been served upon each defendant named in this complaint
either individually or through their agent. Link to the record: https://

bc41-bbc08c814365 All references to the record are marked herein with
“REC. [page]” and are hyperlinked to take the reader directly to the
reference. The record is filed under affidavit, and remains unopposed at the
time of filing this complaint. Therefore, Plaintiff respectfully asks that the
Court take judicial notice of the record under Federal Rule of Evidence 201,
filed on June 6, 2025, in the Texas Supreme Court under case numbers
25-0361, 25-0367, 25-0378, 25-0426, and 25-0458. II. TIMELINE OF
EVENTS BACKGROUND Morgan Michelle Myers, (“Myers”) and Charles
Dustin Myers, (“Plaintiff”) were married on June 20, 2015, and have two
daughters, C.R.M. and M.E.M, aged seven and nine. The evidence in this
case will show that in early December of 2023, the entire family was
blindsided by Myers’ sudden announcement that she wanted a divorce from
Plaintiff. REC. 717 The evidence will further show that Myers’ reasoning for
this divorce changes over time – beginning with how Plaintiff spoke to her,
and then switches to abuse and sexual harassment, and allegations of drug
abuse, claims that were only brought up in her initial pleadings. On
December 12, 2023, Plaintiff discovered a large volume of text messages
between Myers and two individuals identified as Debbie Price and Damen
Kazlauskas of Fort Worth, Texas spanning between October 2022 and
December 2023. REC. 254-714 In response to this discovery, Myers began to
communicate with Defendant Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, a resident of
Yukon, Oklahoma, who assisted her in the planning, drafting, traveling, and
submitting of fraudulent documents to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant
County designed to divest Plaintiff of his home and business operations.
When these allegations were raised to the State, they failed to adjudicate
them and violated the Plaintiff’s constitutional rights when he was deprived
of the guarantees of equal protection under the law and when he was not
afforded due process before being deprived of his property. REC. 183. The
central question is whether Defendants Munford, Kaitcer, Carter, and Baker
are victims of the initial scheme – or willing participants in an expanded
associate-in-fact enterprise that began in December of 2023 as the Myers-
Branthoover enterprise. A. The Myers-Branthoover Enterprise 1. On
December 14, 2023, Defendants Morgan Michelle Myers (“Myers)” and
Daniel Kenneth Branthoover (“Branthoover”), acting in concert and under
deceptive pretenses, (REC. 1704), initiated text-message communications
through which they formed and advanced a common plan and agreement.
Over the weekend of December 15, 2023, they met in Yukon, Oklahoma, to
further that plan ( REC. 274-278). The deceptive text message from
Defendant Branthoover claiming that he wanted to assist Plaintiff was
following an attempt by Myers to receive an ex-parte order of protection
from the 322nd District Court of Tarrant county, attempted on December 14,
2023 (REC. 78). B. Interstate Travel and Transfer 2. As part of their
agreement, both Defendants planned to draft and submit an original petition
for divorce and an affidavit of indigency to the 322nd District Court of
Tarrant County, with the intended and foreseeable result of removing
Plaintiff from his matrimonial residence at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas
76148—which also serves as his place of business for clients in the United
States, Canada, and the United Kingdom that rely on his market data
services (REC. 812 ¶ 16). 3. During Defendant Myers’s interstate travel, she
transferred the parties’ marital funds into Defendant Branthoover’s PayPal
account in the amount of $1,576 (REC. 723). Those proceeds funded a
second mobile phone (817-940-0852), listed on the fraudulent pleadings that

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Myers and Branthoover jointly prepared in Oklahoma, which Myers then
carried from Yukon to Texas on December 17, 2023 (REC. 86; 99; 102; 107).
C. Admissions 4. On December 16, 2023, Plaintiff reached out to
Branthoover and requested that the $1,576 be returned as they were needed
for Christmas gifts for the children, and for business advertising expenses
for his business. REC. 728-729. In response, defendant Branthoover
admitted that the purpose of defendant Myers’ visit was to help her prepare
paperwork for divorce litigation and confirmed that the transfer of $1,576
did in fact occur. REC. 730. Plaintiff’s bank statement from December 2023
further confirms this transaction. REC. 723. D. Post-submission
Collaboration 5. On December 18, 2023, defendant Myers submitted the
fraudulently prepared original petition for divorce, and an affidavit of
indigency to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County. After these
documents were submitted, defendant Branthoover sent a text message to
Plaintiff on December 19, 2023, at 5:50 P.M. CST, holding himself out to be
defendant Myers’ attorney, showing his involvement extends past the initial
help in preparing the fraudulent documents. REC. 1712-1713 6. Four days
later, on December 22, 2023, defendant Myers submitted another knowingly
fraudulent application for protective to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant
County claiming that family violence had occurred on December 18, 2023,
supported by both an affidavit and unsworn declaration. REC. 108-109. E.
Significant and Intentional Misrepresentations 7. On December 27 and
December 28, 2023, respectively, the documents prepared by Myers with
the assistance of Branthoover were served on Plaintiff via the U.S.
Constable, and contained the following misrepresentations: i. That
defendant Myers could not afford court costs; REC. 72, REC. 85-96 ii. That
defendant Myers had an active order of protection against the Plaintiff with
a finding of family violence that had occurred during the marriage; REC. 78
at 10 iii. That defendant Myers was financially responsible for the family
vehicles, rent payments, utilities, and other household expenses, making
herself appear as the primary breadwinner; REC. 92 iv. That defendant
Myers would be harassed or abused if Plaintiff were given her newly
acquired phone number that was obtained while in Oklahoma; REC. 81 at
15. v. That defendant Myers and Plaintiff ceased living together on
December 1, 2023; REC. 74 at 4 vi. That family violence occurred on
December 18, 2023, in the presence of the two Children. REC. 108-109. vii.
That both family vehicles were defendant Myers’ separate property acquired
before marriage. REC. 79 at 11B F. Evidence to the Contrary 8. On the same
day Defendant Myers claimed to be in an emergency requiring the Plaintiff’s
prompt removal from the home, she can be seen at the home with Plaintiff
and the children in no state of emergency and also still cohabitating in the
marital home. REC 1715. 9. Again, on December 29, 2023, Defendant Myers
can be seen with Plaintiff at the family home, smiling and laughing with the
children in no state of emergency and still collaborating with Plaintiff in the
marital home. REC. 1735. 10. The citation for the application for protective
order ordered Respondent to show cause as to why it should not issue with a
hearing scheduled for January 16, 2024. REC. 118. 11. In response to
extensive misrepresentation above, Plaintiff prepared an original answer,
filed a motion to consolidate, and provided background information which
alleged that defendant Myers was intentionally abusing the legal process.
REC. 130-132. Plaintiff was ordered to show cause on January 16, 2024,
regarding the protective order application. REC. 118 G. Inclement Weather

and First Appearance 12. On January 15, 2024, the Tarrant County District
Courts Facebook page sent out a notice informing the members of the public
that the court would be closed on January 16, 2024, due to inclement
weather. REC. 1202. 13. Unaware of the closure at the time, the parties
appeared at the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County on January 16, 2024,
and were met with a dark courtroom, with only one judge in the building at
the time of their arrival – Defendant James Munford (“Munford”). 14.
Defendant Munford summarily ordered the Plaintiff out of his home,
inadvertently assisting the Myers-Branthoover associate-in-fact enterprise of
achieving their primary goal in having the Plaintiff removed from his
residence, despite the broader goal being to obtain a decree of divorce to
permanently divest Plaintiff of his interests. REC. 183. 15. Defendant
Munford’s initial order was baseless, made in the absence of any emergency,
without a hearing, and disregarded the Plaintiff’s pleadings, telling Myers
“you’re going to have to find evidence of family violence!” clearly aware that
this order was made without any regard to the Plaintiff’s constitutional
rights. 16. Defendant Jeffrey Kaitcer, (“Kaitcer”) walked into the courtroom
late due to the inclement weather and turned the courtroom into a laughing
matter as he began to joke with Defendant Munford, and instructed the
parties to download the AppClose app for communication, and the matter
was reset for January 22, 2024. There exists no record of this proceeding,
only marked appearances on the docket. H. Reset #1 – January 22, 2024,
Setting 17. At the January 22 reset hearing, the parties appeared only to
have the case reset once more because defendant Myers allegedly retained
the services of Defendant Cooper Carter, (“Carter”) in the lobby of the
courthouse just moments before the hearing was scheduled to begin. No
appearance can be traced to this setting by either party on the docket (REC.
1551), and once again, no hearing was held, and the case reset for a second
time to February 1, 2024. REC. 186. 18. Kaitcer permitted attorney Dan
Bacalis, Plaintiff’s prior attorney, to fill out the Associate Judge’s Report, and
the parties never went before him as indicated by the case docket’s lack of
appearance on this date by either party. I. Reset #2 – February 1, 2024,
Setting 19. One day prior to the February 1 setting, both attorneys,
Defendant Carter and Dan Bacalis, both amended the petition for divorce
and counterpetition for divorce without the parties’ knowledge. (REC. 189,
REC. 209) These amended documents were similar, submitted on the same
day, and raised concerns for Plaintiff regarding his quality of representation.
20. At the February 1 setting, both parties were in the conference rooms
outside of Defendant Kaitcer’s courtroom, when attorney Bacalis walks in
holding a settlement agreement. When Plaintiff refused this option and
requested that they go have a hearing before the judge. 21. This is when
Bacalis stated, as witness affidavits corroborate, that he “knows this Judge
and this is the best we can get.” and further stated “[w]e’ll be here all day.
We can come back and change it later.” 22. Outraged by this response,
Plaintiff paid very close attention to the settlement offer Bacalis was
pressuring him to sign, and noticed the following provisions: A typed written
Order conforming to this Report will follow within 20 days from the date this
Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be prepared by DAN BACALIS.
Each attorney should approve the Order. The parties do not need to approve
the Order. The attorney reviewing the proposed Order shall have five (5)
days to do so. There arc no ten (JO) day letters. If an agreement is not
reached, a Motion to Sign shall be filed and set within thirty (30) days from

=== PAGE 5 ===

the signing of this Report. IT IS SO ORDERED (REC. 233) J. Termination of
Counsel and the Emergency Motion 23. With the above provisions in mind,
Plaintiff signed the document and immediately fired his attorney and
provided notice to the court. REC. 221. By doing so, Plaintiff gained access
back to the residency, invalidated the agreement, and was able to use the
time back in the house to run damage control on his business operations
while preparing to expose the Myers-Branthoover enterprise to the court via
a MOTION TO RECONSIDER EVIDENCE AND VACATE TEMPORARY
ORDERS, which was filed on February 9, 2024, within three business days of
the February 1 agreed associate judge’s report being served by the clerk.
REC. 240 24. In this motion, it was specifically stated that: i. “I am seeking
immediate court intervention to correct procedural e rrors and address the
misuse of the legal system by the Petitioner.” REC. 244 ii. “Particularly, Dan
Branthoover became involved. He is the boyfriend of the Petitioner’s Mother.
Shortly thereafter, I received a notice from our joint bank account stating
that $1,576 had just been withdrawn. As our bank statement for December
2023 will demonstrate – the transaction record shows the funds being
transferred directly to Mr. Branthoover’s PayPal account” REC. 245 iii. “The
Petitioner's action of filing for divorce under an Affidavit of Inability to pay
three days after transferring $1,576 to herself starkly contravenes the
mandates set forth in Chapter 10, Section 10.001 of the Civil Practice and
Remedies Code”. REC 247 at B2 iv. “The Petitioner violated Chapter 10,
Section 10.001 a second time within the same document when she
intentionally elected to waive the 60-day waiting period claiming to have an
active protective order against me that found family violence had occurred
during our marriage.” REC 247 at B3. v. “This suit was the second attempt
by the Petitioner to have me removed from the home, which ultimately
succeeded.” REC 248 at D1 25. The motion went on to explain the factual
pattern described up to this point, putting the court on notice of the key
issues with provided exhibits which were duly served on Carter. In response
to Plaintiff’s motion, he received the first of just two email communications
from Carter throughout the case’s history, where she claimed she would be
filing a counter motion when disclosing her availability for the hearing on
Plaintiff’s emergency motion. REC. 2794 No such countermotion was filed
by Carter. K. Summary Judgment and Notice of Hearing 26. By February 22,
no response had been filed by Carter, so Plaintiff filed a Partial Motion for
Summary Judgment. REC. 758. Plaintiff also submitted a proposed parenting
plan as Exhibit D. REC. 769. No response was ever received from Carter. 27.
On February 27, 2024, Defendant Munford signed and issued a notice of
hearing to the parties with the hearing set for March 14, 2024. REC. 776. L.
Plaintiff’s Notice to the Court and Defendant Myers’ Self-Help Remedies 28.
On March 3, 2024, Plaintiff notified the Court that he would not be leaving
the home as it was not in the best interests of his children. REC. 782. 29.
The following day, on March 6, 2024, while walking his daughters to school,
Myers ran inside the family home, and locked him out of the marital
residence, leaving a sign on the door that said “[y]ou should have been out
by Saturday you are now locked out!” REC. 1748. 30. Plaintiff called local
law enforcement to help him regain entry into the home, where mother
produced the agreed associate judge’s report signed on February 1, 2024,
and used it as a means to block Plaintiff’s entrance to the home. 31. To avoid
further conflict, Plaintiff was escorted into the home where he was able to
grab only his computer and a few clothes and went to Flower Mound to

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
temporarily stay with his father until the time of the hearing on his
emergency motion, scheduled for March 14, 2024, at 9:00 A.M. L. The
Hearing On Plaintiff’s Emergency Motion 32. On March 14, 2024, the
parties arrived at the 322nd District Court, and on the way into the
courtroom, defendants Myers and Carter could be seen in the conference
room, quickly shuffling papers back and forth. 33. After checking in with the
bailiff, Plaintiff turned around to see defendant Carter extending to him a
document titled “Temporary Orders” that were the reduced version of the
February 1 associate judge’s report. REC. 888. 34. These orders, which were
not prepared by Dan Bacalis, which were not agreed to by the parties, were
reduced well outside of the 20-day requirement as ordered by the judge, and
which were never filed with the clerk, stated the following
misrepresentations: i. On February 1, 2024, the Court heard Petitioner's
motion for temporary orders. ii. The parties have agreed to the terms of this
order as evidenced by the signatures below. REC. 888. iii. The Court, after
examining the record and the agreement of the parties and hearing the
evidence and argument of counsel, finds that all necessary prerequisites of
the law have been legally satisfied and that the Court has jurisdiction of this
case and of all the parties. REC. 888. iv. The dates that the parties would
have access to the family residence was altered, changing the date Plaintiff
was supposed to leave from March 1, 2024, to March 20, 2024, and
changing Myers’ date of re-entry from March 1, 2024, to March 30, 2024,
leaving a 10-day window where no one would occupy the residence. v. This
modification was made to prevent Myers from being liable for illegally
locking Plaintiff out of the home on March 6, 2024. 35. On the last page of
the orders, Plaintiff’s attorney who was terminated weeks earlier did not
sign the document, and Plaintiff refused to sign the document for the
forthcoming reasons: i. It claimed a hearing occurred on a motion which was
never set for a hearing or served on the Plaintiff and doesn’t exist on the
docket. ii. It was prepared by defendant Carter, not Dan Bacalis. iii. The
associate judge was presiding over a de novo request of his own prior
report. iv. The matrimonial address was incorrect, as it stated “6641 Anns
Court”, rather than 6641 Anne Court. REC. 915, REC. 922 v. The orders
were not in the best interests of the children. vi. Notwithstanding the
Plaintiff’s revocation of consent by filing the emergency motion, the terms
were altered right before they were rendered into effect by defendant
Kaitcer. vii. Plaintiff did not agree to the terms as he was in court that very
day to expose Myers. M. Predicate Acts: Extortion 36. Kaitcer, knowing that
no response was filed, knowing that he was presiding over a hearing to
which he had no subject matter jurisdiction, and knowing that the temporary
orders produced by defendant Carter was served just moments earlier,
signed another associate judge’s report pre-drafted by defendant Carter,
which summarily denied the Plaintiff’s emergency motion, ignored the fact
that Carter had not provided a response, and within the report itself,
Plaintiff was ordered to sign the document that Carter had just presented to
him despite raising objections to its’ contents, and despite his consent not
being present. REC. 795. 37. Finally, defendant Kaitcer refused to consider
Plaintiff’s exhibits, including six affidavits prepared by his business clients
who have been directly affected by his inability to provide the real-time
market data services his clients relied on, who were located throughout the
United States. REC. 851; REC. 854; REC. 857; REC. 860; REC. 863; REC.
867; REC. 870. 38. Following the setting, the orders were rendered into

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
effect without Plaintiff’s signature (REC. 925) , and Plaintiff filed a request
for findings of fact and conclusions of law (REC. 883), and filed and
amended a “Preparatory Notice for Judicial Review” which recounted the
factual timeline up to that point, and included the affidavits that Kaitcer
refused to accept on March 14, 2024. REC. 798, REC. 851, REC. 854, REC.
857, REC. 860, REC. 863, REC. 867, REC. 870. 39. The orders stated they
were to remain in effect until the final decree of divorce, and Plaintiff’s
journey of one-sided appeals began. N. One Sided Appellate Efforts, and
Defective IWO 40. Following the rendition of the temporary orders on March
26, 2024, Plaintiff spent between April 8, 2024 and September 15, 2024,
appealing via mandamus to the Second Court of Appeals and the Texas
Supreme Court. REC. 1010. 41. During the appellate efforts, Carter filed one
of two motions in the case, which was a motion for pre-trial conference filed
on April 24, 2024, on her behalf by Roderick D. Marx, a party not named in
the suit. REC. 1014, REC. 1016. 42. Plaintiff immediately objected to the
pre-trial conference, and no response was ever issued by Carter or the
court. REC. 1018. 43. On April 30th, Plaintiff filed his notice of completion
regarding the parenting course as ordered, despite actively trying to vacate
them. REC. 1047. No parenting course was ever completed by Myers. 44. On
May 2, 2024, Plaintiff’s en banc reconsideration was denied in the Second
Court of Appeals, and he began preparing an appeal to the Supreme Court
of Texas. REC. 1067. 45. On May 19, 2024, Carter sent the second and last
email correspondence that would be received in the case, which falsely
claimed he agreed to the orders signed on March 14, 2024, and requested
that he fill out an IWO, which Plaintiff found to be defective. REC. 1722,
REC. 1728. No further correspondence was received by Carter. O.
Fraudulent Intervention and Branthoover’s Continued Involvement 46. On
June 23rd Plaintiff filed a motion in state court entitled MOTION FOR
JOINDER OF PERSONS NEEDED FOR JUST ADJUDICATION at 12:14 P.M.
REC. 1075. This motion received no response from Carter. 47. On June 23rd
at 1:54 P.M., directly following the submission of the motion, Branthoover
texted Plaintiff stating “Lol. And here comes another denial. Please sue me
individually. Please.”, referring to the earlier filed motion and showing his
continued oversight of the case’s progression since his initial predicate acts.
48. Four days later, on June 28, 2024, the Texas Office of the Attorney
General allegedly filed an intervention pleading, claiming that Plaintiff was
past due on child support, and requested information from Plaintiff. REC.
1099. 49. Most notably, the certificate of service to this intervention
pleading was allegedly signed by Holly Hayes, the designated attorney for
the OAG, yet the name underneath the signature line reads CHOYA
BURKLEY. REC. 1102. 50. Plaintiff promptly objected to the intervention,
and never received any response from the OAG, Carter, or the court. REC.
1106. P. Supreme Court, Rule 12, and Emergency Temporary Orders 51. As
Plaintiff continued to appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas, all prosecution
came to an end in the trial court. It wasn’t until September 15, 2024, that
Plaintiff filed a first amended rehearing motion in the Texas Supreme Court,
(REC. 1136) and after noticing Carter’s lack of participation, he began to
question her authority given several ambiguities surrounding her
representation, and filed a rule 12 motion to show authority. REC. 1170. No
response was ever received to this motion from Carter. 52. At this point,
Plaintiff had been staying in Airbnb homes while he sought relief to ensure
he could remain close to his daughters during this time. On September 26,

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
2024, he filed and later amended an EMERGENCY MOTION FOR
TEMPORARY ORDERS and requested expedited relief by October 1, 2024,
as that was when Plaintiff was forced to move away from the area due to
cost of living being unsustainable. REC. 1184. No response was ever
received from Carter regarding this motion. 53. By October 1, Plaintiff had
no choice but to start pursuing administrative remedies, and thought the
court was biased against him given the case’s history up to that point. He
began to prepare a Joint Motion to Recuse defendants Munford and Kaitcer
and filed it with the clerk of the court on October 7, 2024. REC. 1197. Q.
Predicate Act: Wire Fraud 54. On October 8, 2024, Defendant Munford
signed and forwarded a “Joint Motion to Recuse” attached to his order of
referral to regional presiding judge David L. Evans but was notably missing
the exhibits and affidavit critical to the motion. REC. 1222 55. A copy of this
exchange was sent via defendant Baker on 4:43 P.M. on October 8. REC.
1254 56. Plaintiff immediately pointed out the discrepancies between the
motion filed and the motion forwarded to David L. Evans, where she replied
and admitted that the full document had been e-filed and remains with the
court. REC. 1255 57. Unsatisfied with this response, Plaintiff further pointed
out that the filing size of the document filed and the one referring to David
L. Evans was significantly different. No further correspondence was
received by Baker until the following day. REC. 1256 58. The following day
on October 8, 2024, defendant Munford signed and filed an “Amended Order
of Referral” which had the full motion attached this time, albeit still
modified as the hyperlinks and bookmarks had been removed. REC. 1282 59.
This amended referral was sent via email correspondence by Baker at 11:17
A.M. on October 8, 2024, who stated that due to the size of the motion, it
was split into three parts. REC. 1258. This excuse directly contradicts the
standard filing procedure in Tarrant County, which was raised and
subsequently ignored in an objection. REC. 1269. No response was filed in
regard to the motion to recuse or objection by Carter. R. Recusal Denial and
More Delays, and Federal Removal 60. Justice E. Lee Gabriel was assigned
to hear the motion, which had to be rescheduled due to technical difficulties
for November 7, 2024. REC. 1306. 61. The morning of the hearing, Plaintiff
woke up with a dental emergency, and promptly notified all parties, and
requested a reset for the hearing, which everyone agreed to. REC.
1393-1396. 62. Despite this agreement, the recusal was denied for failure to
appear, and made no mention of the agreement or the emergency. REC.
1398. 63. With no other remedies left, Plaintiff removed the case to Federal
Court on December 2, 2024, which was quickly remanded back on
December 4, 2024. REC. 1426. 64. On December 14, 2024, defendant
Branthoover texted Plaintiff, sending a threat which stated “[w]hen things
all over, you get to deal with me.” at 2:15 P.M. REC. 1720 65. On December
16, 2024, Plaintiff initiated suit against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover in the
Western District of Oklahoma seeking relief in the form of damages from the
ongoing deprivation from his home. REC. 1451. 66. Plaintiff notified the
Texas court of this lawsuit on December 31, 2024. REC. 1446. S. Further
Delays, Motion to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution, and the Original SAPCR
67. On January 24, 2025, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss for want of
prosecution due to the total lack of participation in the case by the opposing
party. REC. 1527. No response was ever received from Carter on this
motion. 68. On January 29, 2025, defendant Myers began disposing of
Plaintiff’s personal belongings that remained on the family property. REC.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
1629-1631. 69. On February 12, 2025, Plaintiff learned that his youngest
daughter was suffering from dental pain due to Myers’ failure to obtain
dental insurance for the children. REC. 3281. 70. By March 14, (REC.
1833-1837) the judges had still not been reinstated from the first recusal,
which lad Plaintiff to reach out to Baker to request a hearing on his
unopposed summary judgment that had been on the docket since February
22, 2024, where he had to remind her to reinstate the judges back into the
case. REC. 1833-1837. 71. Given the delays, and since the case had been
brought in bad faith initially, the Plaintiff opened an original SAPCR suit in
the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County on March 18, 2025, where he
argued for dominant jurisdiction in a cover letter sent to the clerk. REC.
2260. T. Counsel Suddenly Becomes Active 72. The very next day, defendant
Carter filed an original answer filed on her behalf by Roderick Marx. REC.
2279. The motion was a boilerplate motion, and was followed by a motion to
consolidate, which was filed in the wrong court, and was also filed on
Carter’s behalf by RODERICK D. MARX. REC. 2284. 73. The Plaintiff
immediately responded by filing a motion to strike (REC. 1957) a Rule 12
motion to show authority challenging both Carter and RODERICK D MARX’s
authority (REC. 2288) and on March 24, 2025, an emergency ex-parte TRO
to prevent Myers from barring Plaintiff’s access to the home. (REC. 2302)
No responses were ever received from Carter on these motions. 74. On
March 26, 2025, an objection was filed to Carter’s consolidation motion in
the 233rd court. REC. 1881. 75. Plaintiff reached out to the coordinator from
the 233rd and went through the process to present the motion to the judge.
REC. 2338-2341. 76. On March 29, 2025, Plaintiff appeared before Associate
Judge Kate Stone, who refused to hear Plaintiff’s emergency motion despite
no response being filed, and told him to leave the courtroom. The hearing
date scheduled for April 10, 2025, as agreed by Carter and Plaintiff (REC.
2358), was actually un-set by Stone. REC. 2361. 77. The grounds for this
outright refusal was due to Carter calling in a favor from the judge without
even being present in the courtroom, to where Stone left the room, came
back, and told the Plaintiff to leave informing him that a motion to
consolidate would be filed by Carter the following week. U. Five Concurrent
Mandamus Petitions 78. Subsequently, after he was turned away from the
courtroom, Carter’s consolidation motion wasn’t filed until April 4, 2025
(REC. 2367), resulting in two mandamus petitions to try again to have the
March 14, 2024, order signed by Kaitcer vacated, and to compel Kate Stone
to hear the emergency TRO. See 25-0361, 25-0367. 79. On the same day the
mandamus was filed against Stone, District Judge Kenneth Newell sua
sponte granted Carter’s consolidation motion in both courts without a
hearing, and without addressing the emergency situation for the children or
the Plaintiff’s objections, leading to a third mandamus proceeding. REC.
2393, See also 25-0378. 80. On April 23, 2025, a notice of trial setting was
served on the parties by defendant Munford in the midst of all of these
issues. REC. 1773. 81. The same day, Plaintiff filed an objection and
requested an emergency stay. REC. 2219. No response was received to this
objection by either Munford or Carter. 82. Two days later on April 25, 2025,
Plaintiff filed his second recusal motion, and amended it on April 28, 2025,
this time only against Munford, and requested that the rules of procedure be
followed, and objected to the involvement of the court coordinator given the
prior recusal’s ambiguity and significant delays caused by her involvement.
REC. 2488 No response to this motion was ever filed from Carter. 83. Baker

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
continued to be involved in the recusal process, this time erroneously
forwarding an order of referral from defendant Kaitcer, who was not named
in the recusal motion. REC. 2615. 84. Plaintiff immediately objected on April
29, 2025, naming two issues: 1) the coordinator was still involved, and 2) the
order of referral sent by Kaitcer was erroneous. REC. 2620. 84. Plaintiff
objected to the order of assignment of John H. Cayce (REC. 3149) which was
issued on May 7, 2025, due to the unresolves issues. REC. 2620. 85. David L.
Evans overruled this objection on May 15, 2025, leading to mandamus
petition 25-0426, a direct appeal to the Texas Supreme Court. REC. 3507.
86. On May 20, 2025, John H. Cayce summarily denied the recusal, including
the denial of a motion to recuse Kaitcer which was never filed, leading to
mandamus petition 25-0458, a second direct appeal to the Texas Supreme
Court. 87. All five petitions were denied both initially and on rehearing, and
all emergency motions to stay proceedings were dismissed. The only insights
given from the appellate courts was: “Denied, per curiam.” No response was
filed by any implicated judge or opposing counsel. V. Federal RICO Case and
the Push Towards Final Trial 88. In June of 2025, Plaintiff amended his
complaint against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover and enjoined Myers as a
defendant, which they defended pro-se. 89. Plaintiff communicated this
action with the trial court, and no further action was taken in the case until
August of 2025, when defendant Munford sua sponte set the case for final
trial on December 10, 2025. 90. Plaintiff immediately objected to this trial
setting, and moved to recuse Munford for a third time. 91. The court
coordinator continued to be involved in the process, leading to a subsequent
motion to recuse the regional presiding judge, David L. Evans. 92. Plaintiff
now prepares this suit to hold defendants accountable for their collective
actions, and to prevent their common goal from being achieved, which is to
obtain defendant Myers a final decree of divorce. 93. For the forthcoming
reasons, the conduct outlined herein constitutes conduct of an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity, as several predicate acts were
committed, the enterprise shares a common purpose, and Plaintiff has
suffered direct and ongoing injury to business and property as a direct result
of the defendant’s collective predicate acts. RICO The timeline and evidence
provided demonstrate that the Myers-Branthoover group constitutes an
association-in-fact enterprise under RICO, with a common goal to deprive
the Plaintiff of his home and business through a pattern of racketeering
activity—specifically, wire fraud, Travel Act violations, and fraudulent court
filings—causing direct injury to the Plaintiff’s business and property. The
conduct, structure, and continuity among the participants, as well as the use
of interstate communications and travel, satisfy the elements of a RICO
claim in the Tenth Circuit, with the liability of other defendants depending
on their knowledge and intent. A. Summary The Myers-Branthoover
enterprise, as detailed in the factual timeline, meets the Tenth Circuit’s
requirements for a RICO claim by establishing an association-in-fact
enterprise with a defined structure, purpose, and continuity. The group’s
coordinated actions—including interstate transfer of funds, preparation and
submission of fraudulent legal documents, and ongoing manipulation of
court proceedings—constitute a pattern of racketeering activity, with
predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations that are related and
continuous. Plaintiff’s direct and ongoing injury to his business and property,
including loss of home, business operations, and client relationships, is
proximately caused by the enterprise’s acts. While Myers and Branthoover’s

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
liability is clear, the involvement of other defendants (Munford, Kaitcer,
Carter, and Baker) may be characterized as inadvertent or willing
participation, depending on their knowledge and intent, but the core
elements of a RICO violation are satisfied by the conduct of Myers and
Branthoover as outlined in the enumerated timeline. The additional acts
committed by each defendant, as alleged, furthered the scheme of the
enterprise despite each additional defendant having actual knowledge of the
fraudulent scheme. RICO Statutory Framework The Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), codified at 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968,
provides a civil cause of action for individuals injured in their business or
property by reason of a pattern of racketeering activity conducted through
an enterprise affecting interstate or foreign commerce. The most commonly
invoked provision, § 1962(c), prohibits any person employed by or associated
with an enterprise from conducting or participating in the conduct of such
enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. Section
1962(d) further prohibits conspiracies to violate any of the substantive RICO
provisions. To establish a civil RICO claim under § 1962(c), a plaintiff must
prove: i. The existence of an enterprise; ii. The enterprise’s engagement in,
or effect on, interstate or foreign commerce; iii. The defendant’s
employment by or association with the enterprise; iv. The defendant’s
participation, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs;
v. The defendant’s participation through a pattern of racketeering activity or
collection of unlawful debt. See 100 Mount Holly Bypass v. Axos Bank, Case
No. 2:20-CV-856-TS-CMR (D. Utah Jul 27, 2021). B. Predicate Acts and
Pattern Requirement RICO defines “racketeering activity” to include a wide
range of criminal offenses, including wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343) and
violations of the Travel Act (18 U.S.C. § 1952). A “pattern of racketeering
activity” requires at least two predicate acts within a ten-year period, but
the acts must be related and amount to or pose a threat of continued
criminal activity. The Supreme Court has clarified that a RICO violation
requires both an “enterprise” and a “pattern of racketeering activity,” with
the enterprise being a group of persons associated for a common purpose,
and the pattern involving a series of criminal acts (United States v. Harris,
695 F.3d 1125 (10th Cir. 2012)). The Tenth Circuit has further explained
that, to establish a pattern, it is not enough to simply show that two
predicate acts occurred within ten years; the acts must also be related and
pose a threat of continued criminal activity (U.S. v. Smith, 413 F.3d 1253
(10th Cir. 2005)). Note, however, that U.S. v. Smith has been stated as
overruled by United States v. Nissen, 555 F.Supp.3d 1174 (D. N.M. 2021) on
unrelated grounds, but its articulation of the pattern requirement remains
consistent with current law. C. Enterprise and Association-in-Fact An
“enterprise” under RICO includes any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or group of individuals associated in fact, even if not a legal
entity. For an association-in-fact enterprise, the Tenth Circuit requires: i. A
purpose; ii. Relationships among those associated with the enterprise; iii.
Longevity sufficient to permit the associates to pursue the enterprise’s
purpose; iv. A decision-making framework or mechanism for controlling the
group; v. Functioning as a continuing unit; vi. Existence separate and apart
from the pattern of racketeering activity. See 100 Mount Holly Bypass. D.
Conspiracy Section 1962(d) makes it unlawful to conspire to violate any of
the substantive RICO provisions. A RICO conspiracy does not require the
establishment of an enterprise but requires that a defendant adopts the goal

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
of furthering or facilitating a criminal endeavor that would satisfy the
elements of a substantive RICO offense (United States v. Martinez, 543
F.Supp.3d 1209 (D. N.M. 2021); United States v. Randall, 661 F.3d 1291
(10th Cir. 2011)). E. Injury Requirement RICO provides a private right of
action for individuals injured in their business or property through
fraudulent conduct, and there is no requirement that the conduct be
connected to organized crime in a civil setting (Plains Resources, Inc. v.
Gable, 782 F.2d 883 (10th Cir. 1986)). ANALYSIS F. Existence of an
Association-in-Fact Enterprise The timeline establishes that Myers and
Branthoover formed an association-in-fact enterprise beginning in December
2023 (¶¶ 1–7, 93). Their collaboration was structured, with Myers as the
petitioner in the divorce and Branthoover as the planner, drafter, and
facilitator of fraudulent documents and financial transactions. The group
had a clear purpose: to divest the Plaintiff of his home and business through
fraudulent legal filings and manipulation of court processes (¶¶ 1–7, 93).
The enterprise’s structure is evidenced by: i. The initial planning and
agreement to meet in Yukon, Oklahoma, to draft fraudulent documents (¶¶
1–3); ii. The use of interstate communications and travel to further the
scheme (¶¶ 2–3); iii. Ongoing coordination and adaptation to changing
circumstances, including the preparation and submission of false affidavits
and pleadings, and manipulation of court proceedings (¶¶ 5–7, 34, 93). This
satisfies the Tenth Circuit’s requirements for an association-in-fact
enterprise, which does not require a formal legal entity but does require a
common purpose, relationships, and sufficient longevity to pursue the
enterprise’s goals. G. Structure, Purpose, Relationships, and Continuity The
Myers-Branthoover group meets the requirements for an association-in-fact
enterprise: i. Purpose: The shared goal was to deprive the Plaintiff of his
home, business, and property interests through fraudulent means (¶¶ 1–7,
93). ii. Relationships: Myers and Branthoover maintained ongoing
communications, coordinated actions, and divided roles in the scheme (¶¶ 1–
7, 93). iii. Longevity and Continuity: The enterprise operated over a
substantial period, from at least December 2023 through present day 2025,
with multiple related acts and ongoing adaptation to changing
circumstances (¶¶ 1–93). iv. Decision-Making Framework: The group
planned, agreed on steps, and executed those steps in a coordinated manner
(¶¶ 1–7, 93). v. Existence Separate from Predicate Acts: The enterprise was
formed for the purpose of achieving a specific goal and engaged in multiple
acts over time to accomplish that goal. H. Predicate Acts: Wire Fraud, Travel
Act Violations, and Fraudulent Filings The timeline identifies multiple
predicate acts that qualify as racketeering activity under RICO: i. Wire
Fraud: Myers transferred $1,576 in marital funds to Branthoover’s PayPal
account during interstate travel, and these funds were used to purchase a
phone for use in the fraudulent scheme (¶¶ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 34). The use of
electronic communications (text messages, emails) to plan and execute the
scheme further supports the wire fraud allegation (¶¶ 1–7, 34). ii. Travel Act
Violations: Myers traveled from Texas to Oklahoma to meet with
Branthoover, where they planned and prepared fraudulent legal documents,
which were then transported back to Texas and submitted to the court (¶¶ 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7). iii. Fraudulent Filings: The preparation and submission of false
affidavits and pleadings to the court, containing material misrepresentations
about financial status, family violence, and property ownership, constitute
further predicate acts (¶¶ 5, 6, 7, 34). At least two related predicate acts

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
within ten years are required (U.S. v. Smith, 413 F.3d 1253 (10th Cir. 2005)),
and the timeline shows multiple, related predicate acts over a substantial
period (¶¶ 1–93). I. Pattern of Racketeering Activity: Relatedness and
Continuity The predicate acts were not isolated incidents but part of an
ongoing scheme. The acts were related in that they all aimed to deprive the
Plaintiff of his property and business, and they posed a threat of continued
criminal activity, as the enterprise continued to operate and adapt its tactics
over time (¶¶ 1–93). The timeline shows that the enterprise’s activities
extended over a substantial period, with multiple acts occurring over
months and involving ongoing coordination and adaptation to changing
circumstances. J. Injury to Business or Property Plaintiff suffered direct and
ongoing injury to his business and property as a result of the enterprise’s
actions. He was deprived of his home and business operations, lost access to
marital funds, and was unable to provide services to clients, resulting in
financial harm (¶¶ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 37). These injuries are precisely the type
of harm RICO is designed to redress. Plains Resources, Inc. v. Gable, 782 F.
2d 883 (10th Cir. 1986)). K. Participation of Other Defendants: Inadvertent
or Willing The timeline raises the question of whether Munford, Kaitcer,
Carter, and Baker were victims of the initial scheme or willing participants
in the expanded enterprise. The evidence suggests that, at a minimum,
Myers and Branthoover were the core members of the enterprise, with
others potentially becoming involved through their actions in the legal
proceedings (¶¶ 14–93). i. Inadvertent Participation: Some defendants may
have participated inadvertently, such as by issuing orders or facilitating
court processes without knowledge of the underlying scheme (¶¶ 14–93). ii.
Willing Participation: Others may have become willing participants if they
knowingly furthered the enterprise’s objectives or ignored clear evidence of
fraud and misrepresentation (¶¶ 14–93). RICO does not impose liability for
inadvertent or unwitting participation; there must be knowing and willful
involvement in the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs. For the forthcoming
reasons, Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants are willing participants in the
scheme. VICTIM OR PARTICIPANT RICO liability extends to those who
knowingly participate in the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs, even if they
were not original members (RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31)). The timeline
raises the question of whether Munford, Kaitcer, Carter, and Baker were
victims of the initial scheme or willing participants in the expanded
enterprise. The evidence suggests that, at a minimum, Myers and
Branthoover were the core members of the enterprise, with others becoming
involved through their actions in the legal proceedings (¶¶ 14–93). The
timeline demonstrates that Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers engaged in extortion
by leveraging the threat of adverse legal action, fraudulent court orders, and
the manipulation of judicial process to coerce Plaintiff into relinquishing
property and business interests, satisfying the elements of extortion as a
predicate act under RICO and the Travel Act. Munford and Baker, for their
part, committed wire fraud by intentionally sending altered or incomplete
court documents via interstate email, with the intent to mislead, obstruct
relief, and further the enterprise’s objective of finalizing the divorce and
depriving Plaintiff of his property, thus meeting the requirements for wire
fraud as a RICO predicate act. These acts, as detailed in the timeline, are
not isolated but part of a coordinated pattern of racketeering activity within
an association-in-fact enterprise, as required by RICO in the Tenth Circuit.
The conduct of each defendant is tied to specific predicate acts—extortion

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
for Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers (notably at timeline events 33–37), and wire
fraud for Munford and Baker (notably at events 54–59, 83)—demonstrating
knowing and willful participation in the enterprise’s broader scheme to
deprive Plaintiff of his home and business through fraudulent and coercive
means. A. Extortion and Wire Fraud The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968, provides a civil cause of
action for injury to business or property caused by a pattern of racketeering
activity conducted through an enterprise affecting interstate commerce.
Predicate acts under RICO include extortion (as defined by the Hobbs Act
and the Travel Act) and wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343), among others.
Extortion is defined as obtaining property from another, with his consent,
induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or
under color of official right. The Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1952, includes
extortion as an “unlawful activity” and does not require it to be part of a
business enterprise (U.S. v. Welch, 327 F.3d 1081 (10th Cir. 2003)). The
Tenth Circuit recognizes that extortion under the Travel Act can be
established by showing threats or coercion to obtain something of value,
including property or legal rights, in violation of state or federal law. Wire
fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 requires (1) a scheme to defraud or obtain
property by false or fraudulent pretenses, (2) intent to defraud, and (3) use
of interstate wire communications to execute the scheme (Clinton v. Sec.
Benefit Life Ins. Co., 63 F.4th 1264 (10th Cir. 2023); United States v.
Holloway, 826 F.3d 1237 (10th Cir. 2016)). The Tenth Circuit requires that
the deprivation of property be a central object of the scheme, and that the
use of wires (including email) be knowing and in furtherance of the
fraudulent scheme (United States v. Tao, 629 F.Supp.3d 1083). B. Extortion
by Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers Extortion, as a RICO predicate act, is defined
broadly under federal law and the Travel Act. It includes obtaining property
or rights through threats, coercion, or misuse of official process (U.S. v.
Welch, 327 F.3d 1081 (10th Cir. 2003)). The Tenth Circuit does not require
extortion to be part of a business enterprise for Travel Act purposes; a single
act suffices if it has the requisite interstate nexus. The timeline shows the
following: i. Event 33–34: Carter, with Myers, prepared and presented
“Temporary Orders” that misrepresented facts (e.g., that Plaintiff agreed to
terms he did not, that a hearing occurred when it did not, and that the
orders were in the best interests of the children). These orders altered the
dates of access to the home to shield Myers from liability for locking Plaintiff
out, and were presented to Plaintiff in a context where he was under threat
of losing his home and business. iii. Event 36: Kaitcer, knowing the orders
were disputed and that no response had been filed, signed an associate
judge’s report pre-drafted by Carter, summarily denying Plaintiff’s
emergency motion and ordering Plaintiff to sign the disputed document,
despite his objections and lack of consent. iv. Event 35: Plaintiff refused to
sign the orders for multiple reasons, including their fraudulent content and
the lack of due process, but the orders were rendered into effect without his
signature. These acts collectively demonstrate the use of legal process and
the threat of adverse judicial action to coerce Plaintiff into surrendering his
property and business interests. The manipulation of court orders, the
misrepresentation of facts, and the pressure to sign under threat of losing
his home constitute extortion under the Travel Act and RICO (U.S. v. Welch,
327 F.3d 1081 (10th Cir. 2003). Myers’s role is clear: she was the beneficiary
and instigator of the fraudulent filings and the manipulation of court

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
process, using the threat of legal action and the actual deprivation of
Plaintiff’s property to achieve her goal. Carter and Kaitcer acted in concert
with Myers, knowingly facilitating the extortion by preparing, presenting,
and enforcing fraudulent orders, and by using the authority of the court to
coerce Plaintiff. The fact that Plaintiff was ordered to sign a document he
objected to, under threat of continued deprivation of his home and business,
is classic extortion by color of official right. All three defendants knew that
Plaintiff did not agree to the order, as he had just fired his attorney to
challenge any basis for an agreement. This implies that despite the motion
being served on all defendants, they chose to ignore the allegations of a
fraudulent scheme and further the affairs of the enterprise. These actions
meet the requirements for extortion as a RICO predicate act: they involved
the wrongful use of threats and official process to obtain property (the home
and business) from Plaintiff, with his consent induced by fear of further loss
or legal harm. The acts were not isolated but part of a coordinated scheme
to achieve the enterprise’s goal of finalizing the divorce and divesting
Plaintiff of his property B. Wire Fraud by Munford and Baker Wire fraud
under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 requires a scheme to defraud, intent to defraud, and
use of interstate wire communications to execute the scheme (Clinton v. Sec.
Benefit Life Ins. Co., 63 F.4th 1264 (10th Cir. 2023); United States v.
Holloway, 826 F.3d 1237 (10th Cir. 2016)). The Tenth Circuit recognizes that
sending altered or incomplete court documents via email, with the intent to
mislead or deprive someone of property or rights, can constitute wire fraud
if the deprivation of property is a central object of the scheme (United
States v. Tao, 629 F.Supp.3d 1083). The timeline shows the following: i.
Event 54: Munford signed and forwarded a “Joint Motion to Recuse”
attached to his order of referral, but the document was missing critical
exhibits and affidavits necessary for Plaintiff’s relief. ii. Event 55: Baker sent
a copy of this incomplete filing via email, representing it as the full
document. iii. Event 56–57: When Plaintiff pointed out the discrepancies,
Baker provided inconsistent explanations, first claiming the full document
was e-filed, then later stating it was split into three parts due to size. iv.
Event 58: Munford signed and filed an “Amended Order of Referral” with the
full motion attached, but with hyperlinks and bookmarks removed, further
impairing the document’s integrity. v. Event 59, 83: Baker continued to
forward altered or incomplete orders and referrals, even when procedural
irregularities were raised. These acts involved the knowing use of interstate
email to transmit altered or incomplete court documents, with the intent to
prevent Plaintiff from obtaining relief and to further the enterprise’s goal of
finalizing the divorce and depriving Plaintiff of his property. The use of email
to transmit these documents satisfies the interstate wire requirement, and
the intent to defraud is evidenced by the deliberate alteration and
misrepresentation of the filings. The conduct of Munford and Baker meets
the elements of wire fraud: (1) a scheme to defraud Plaintiff of property and
rights, (2) intent to defraud by preventing relief and misleading the court
and Plaintiff, and (3) use of interstate wire communications (email) to
execute the scheme (Clinton v. Sec. Benefit Life Ins. Co., 63 F.4th 1264 (10th
Cir. 2023)). The deprivation of property (Plaintiff’s home and business) was
a central object of the scheme, not a minor part. RELATIONSHIP AND
CONTINUITY All these acts—extortion by Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers, and
wire fraud by Munford and Baker—were committed in furtherance of the
Myers-Branthoover enterprise’s overarching objective: to finalize the

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
divorce and divest Plaintiff of his home and business. The acts were
coordinated, continuous, and related, satisfying the RICO pattern
requirement. The timeline shows that each defendant’s conduct was not an
isolated error or routine administrative act, but part of a deliberate scheme
to use the legal process, threats, and fraudulent communications to achieve
the enterprise’s unlawful goals. DAMAGES The harm inflicted upon Plaintiff
is staggering. He has lost the home in which he lived for nearly a third of his
life, the companionship of his spouse, and the society of his children. His
income has collapsed. For two years he has been consigned to a futile
appellate gauntlet, even as Defendants Munford, Kaitcer, Baker, and Carter
have repeatedly exceeded the bounds of their lawful authority in furtherance
of a broader scheme. What began as a concerted effort by Myers and
Branthoover to dispossess Plaintiff of his residence and property
metastasized into a calculated plan to procure a final decree of divorce once
the initial objective had been achieved. The objective was plain: by
engineering a final decree, Defendants would not only hobble Plaintiff’s
ability to bring this suit but also invite invocation of the Rooker–Feldman
doctrine and related abstention principles to preclude federal jurisdiction.
Now, after two years of unremitting effort, Plaintiff seeks the only
meaningful remedy remaining: federal redress to halt the ongoing abuses of
authority, to unwind tainted actions, and to compensate him fully for the
catastrophic losses Defendants have wrought. Take each piece in the TABLE
OF CONTENTS, research the topic, and tie it to the factual timeline, filling
out each element of the RICO complaint and tie each element to the factual
allegations by enumerated paragraph number. What are the legal standards
for pleading a RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) in the Fifth
Circuit, and what factual allegations are required to support such a claim?
Answer (Fifth Circuit)
Short response
To plead a RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) in the Fifth Circuit, a
plaintiff must allege that two or more persons agreed to commit a
substantive RICO violation and that each defendant knew of and agreed to
the overall objective of the RICO offense. The complaint must set forth
specific facts showing an agreement to commit predicate acts of
racketeering as part of the enterprise, not merely conclusory allegations or
association.
Summary
The Fifth Circuit requires that a RICO conspiracy claim under § 1962(d) be
supported by factual allegations showing (1) an agreement among at least
two persons to commit a substantive RICO violation (i.e., to conduct or
participate in the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering
activity), and (2) that each defendant knew of and agreed to the overall
objective of the RICO offense. The complaint must specifically allege the
existence of the enterprise, the pattern of racketeering activity (with at least

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
two related predicate acts), the nature of the agreement, and each
defendant’s knowing participation or adoption of the conspiracy’s goals.
Conclusory statements or mere association with alleged conspirators are
insufficient; the plaintiff must plead facts implying an agreement to commit
the predicate acts and knowledge that these acts were part of a pattern of
racketeering activity. Circumstantial evidence may be used to infer
agreement and intent, but the complaint must tie each defendant to the
conspiracy through specific factual allegations, such as overt acts,
communications, or conduct in furtherance of the enterprise’s unlawful
objectives.
Background and Relevant Law
Statutory Framework
Section 1962(d) of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
(RICO) makes it unlawful for any person to conspire to violate the
substantive provisions of RICO, namely §§ 1962(a), (b), or (c). To state a
claim under § 1962(d), the plaintiff must first adequately plead a substantive
RICO violation under one of these subsections, as a conspiracy claim cannot
stand alone without a viable underlying RICO offense (Gordon v.
Neugebauer, 57 F.Supp.3d 766 (W.D. Tex. 2014); N. Cypress Med. Ctr.
Operating Co. v. Cigna Healthcare, 781 F.3d 182 (5th Cir. 2015)).
The elements of a substantive RICO claim are: (1) a person who engages in
(2) a pattern of racketeering activity (3) connected to the acquisition,
establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise (Bustos v. Invierte En
Tex. (2024-06-03); Belton v. Regions Bank (2025-08-07); D&T Partners L.L.C.
v. Baymark Partners Mgmt., L.L.C., 98 F.4th 198 (5th Cir. 2024)).
“Racketeering activity” includes a range of criminal acts, such as wire fraud,
mail fraud, and extortion (Bustos v. Invierte En Tex. (2024-06-03)).
RICO Conspiracy: Fifth Circuit Standards
To plead a RICO conspiracy under § 1962(d), the Fifth Circuit requires the
plaintiff to allege: (1) that two or more persons agreed to commit a
substantive RICO offense, and (2) that the defendant knew of and agreed to
the overall objective of the RICO offense (Chaney v. Dreyfus Service Corp.,
595 F.3d 219, 239 (5th Cir. 2010); United States v. Rosenthal, 805 F.3d 523,
531 (5th Cir. 2015); U.S. v. Sharpe, 193 F.3d 852, 869 (5th Cir. 1999); Egana
v. Blair's Bail Bonds Inc., CIVIL ACTION NO: 17-5899 (E.D. La. Mar 11,
2019)). The core of a RICO conspiracy is the agreement to commit predicate
acts of racketeering as part of the enterprise (Abraham v. Singh, 480 F.3d
351, 355 (5th Cir. 2007); Crowe v. Henry, 43 F.3d 198, 206 (5th Cir. 1995)).
The complaint must specifically allege such an agreement; conclusory
allegations that defendants “conspired” are insufficient (Tel-Phonic Services,
Inc. v. TBS Intern., Inc., 975 F.2d 1134, 1140 (5th Cir. 1992), superseded on
other grounds by Benchmark Electronics, Inc. v. J.M. Huber Corp., 343 F.3d
719 (5th Cir. 2003)). The plaintiff must plead facts implying an agreement to

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
commit predicate acts and knowledge that the acts were part of a pattern of
racketeering activity (In re Uplift RX, LLC, 17-32186, Adversary 21-3936
(Bankr. S.D. Tex. Aug 21, 2023)).
Circumstantial evidence may be used to infer agreement and intent, as
direct evidence is rarely available (U.S. v. Posada-Rios, 158 F.3d 832, 857
(5th Cir. 1998)). However, mere association with conspirators or presence in
a suspicious environment is not enough (Chaney v. Dreyfus Service Corp.,
595 F.3d 219, 239 (5th Cir. 2010)).
Analysis
I. Jurisdiction and Venue
Federal courts have jurisdiction over civil RICO claims under 18 U.S.C. §
1964(c), provided the alleged enterprise’s activities affect interstate
commerce (Trevino v. Pechero, 592 F.Supp.2d 939 (S.D. Tex. 2008)). Venue is
proper where any act in furtherance of the conspiracy occurred or where
any defendant resides or may be found.
In the factual timeline, the alleged enterprise’s activities—such as interstate
wire transfers, communications, and the use of the federal court system—
demonstrate the requisite nexus with interstate commerce (see, e.g., REC. 3,
5, 34).
II. Parties
The complaint must identify each defendant alleged to be part of the
conspiracy and describe their roles in the enterprise. Here, the parties
include Myers, Branthoover, Munford, Kaitcer, Carter, and Baker, each
alleged to have participated in the enterprise’s affairs through specific acts
(see timeline, ¶¶ 1–93).
III. Record References
The Fifth Circuit permits courts to take judicial notice of public records,
including state court filings, when their authenticity is not reasonably
disputed (Miller v. Dunn, 35 F.4th 1007 (5th Cir. 2022); LUV N' Care, Ltd. v.
Jackel Int'l Ltd., 502 F.Supp.3d 1106 (W.D. La. 2020)). The complaint’s
references to the consolidated mandamus record and other public filings are
therefore proper and may be considered in evaluating the sufficiency of the
pleadings.
IV. Introduction
The introduction should set forth the nature of the RICO conspiracy claim,
the existence of the enterprise, the pattern of racketeering activity, and the
injury to the plaintiff’s business or property. The complaint must make clear
that the alleged conduct is not merely a series of isolated acts, but part of a
coordinated scheme to further the enterprise’s unlawful objectives.

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
V. Factual Timeline
A. The Myers-Branthoover Enterprise
The timeline must allege facts showing the formation of an association-in-
fact enterprise, including its structure, purpose, and continuity (D&T
Partners LLC v. Baymark Partners LP (2022-05-09)). Here, the complaint
alleges that Myers and Branthoover formed an enterprise in December 2023
to deprive Plaintiff of his home and business through fraudulent legal filings
and manipulation of court proceedings (¶¶ 1–7, 93).
B. Interstate Travel and Transfer
Allegations of interstate travel, wire transfers, and use of interstate
communications support the enterprise’s effect on interstate commerce and
the commission of predicate acts such as wire fraud and Travel Act
violations (¶¶ 2–3, 5, 34).
C. Admissions
The complaint should include admissions or statements by conspirators that
evidence the agreement and the purpose of the enterprise (¶ 4).
D. Post-submission Collaboration
Ongoing collaboration and adaptation to changing circumstances
demonstrate the enterprise’s continuity and the participants’ knowing
involvement (¶¶ 5–7, 34).
E. Significant and Intentional Misrepresentations
Specific misrepresentations in court filings and affidavits are alleged as
predicate acts of wire fraud and fraudulent court filings (¶¶ 7, 34).
F. Evidence to the Contrary
Allegations that contradict the defendants’ representations support the
inference of fraudulent intent and knowing participation in the scheme (¶¶
8–11).
G–V. Subsequent Events
The timeline details a series of overt acts by each defendant, including the
preparation and submission of fraudulent documents, manipulation of court
orders, and use of threats or coercion to obtain property or legal rights (¶¶
12–93). These acts are tied to the enterprise’s objectives and support the
existence of an agreement among the defendants.

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
VI. The RICO Enterprise
A. Structure and Membership
The complaint must allege the existence of an enterprise, either formal or
informal, with a common purpose and functioning as a continuing unit (D&T
Partners LLC v. Baymark Partners LP (2022-05-09)). The Myers-Branthoover
group is alleged to be such an enterprise, with each defendant playing a
defined role (¶¶ 1–7, 93).
B. Expansion, Purpose, and Continuity
The enterprise’s purpose—to deprive Plaintiff of his home and business—is
supported by the coordinated actions and ongoing adaptation to new
circumstances (¶¶ 1–93).
C. Decision-Making and Functioning as a Unit
The complaint must allege facts showing how the enterprise made decisions
and functioned as a unit, such as through meetings, communications, and
joint actions (¶¶ 1–7, 34, 93).
VII. Predicate Acts
A. Wire Fraud
The complaint must allege at least two predicate acts of racketeering, such
as wire fraud, with specific facts showing the use of interstate wires to
further the scheme (¶¶ 3, 5, 34, 54–59, 83).
B. Travel Act Violation
Allegations of interstate travel to further the scheme support the
commission of Travel Act violations (¶¶ 2–3, 5, 34).
C. Extortion
The use of threats, coercion, or misuse of official process to obtain property
or legal rights constitutes extortion as a predicate act (¶¶ 33–37).
D. Fraudulent Court Filings
The preparation and submission of false affidavits and pleadings are alleged
as further predicate acts (¶¶ 5–7, 34).

=== PAGE 21 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
E. Relatedness and Continuity
The complaint must allege that the predicate acts are related and amount to
or pose a threat of continued criminal activity (Burrell v. Concept AG, LLC,
CIVIL ACTION NO. 4:19-cv-00124-NBB-JMV (N.D. Miss. Sep 30, 2020)).
VIII. RICO Conspiracy
A. Agreement Among Defendants
The core requirement is an agreement among at least two persons to
commit a substantive RICO violation (Chaney v. Dreyfus Service Corp., 595
F.3d 219, 239 (5th Cir. 2010); Abraham v. Singh, 480 F.3d 351, 355 (5th Cir.
2007)). The complaint must allege facts implying such an agreement, such
as communications, joint actions, or overt acts in furtherance of the
conspiracy (¶¶ 1–7, 33–37, 54–59, 83).
B. Overt Acts in Furtherance
While an overt act is not strictly required for a RICO conspiracy, allegations
of overt acts help support the inference of agreement and knowing
participation (U.S. v. Stratton, 649 F.2d 1066, 1074 (5th Cir. 1981)).
IX. Potential Defenses
Defendants may raise defenses such as preclusion, the Rooker-Feldman
doctrine, Younger abstention, judicial immunity, or other affirmative
defenses. The complaint should anticipate and address these where possible.
X. State Law Claims
The complaint may also include state law claims such as fraud, abuse of
process, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, but these are
distinct from the RICO conspiracy claim.
XI. Claims for Relief
The plaintiff must specify the relief sought, including compensatory, treble,
and punitive damages, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief.
XII. Damages
The complaint must allege injury to the plaintiff’s business or property as a
result of the conspiracy (WASTE MANAGEMENT OF LOUISIANA v. River
Birch, Inc., 920 F.3d 958 (5th Cir. 2019)).
XIII. Prayer for Relief
The prayer for relief should request all appropriate remedies, including
damages and equitable relief.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Exceptions and Caveats
If the plaintiff fails to adequately plead a substantive RICO violation
under §§ 1962(a), (b), or (c), the conspiracy claim under § 1962(d) must
also fail (Gordon v. Neugebauer, 57 F.Supp.3d 766 (W.D. Tex. 2014); N.
Cypress Med. Ctr. Operating Co. v. Cigna Healthcare, 781 F.3d 182 (5th
Cir. 2015)).
The Fifth Circuit has clarified that mere association or presence in a
suspicious environment is insufficient; the plaintiff must plead facts
showing each defendant’s knowing agreement to further the
enterprise’s unlawful objectives (Chaney v. Dreyfus Service Corp., 595
F.3d 219, 239 (5th Cir. 2010)).
Some authorities cited have been superseded or abrogated in part (e.g., 
Tel-Phonic Services, Inc. v. TBS Intern., Inc., 975 F.2d 1134 (5th Cir.
1992)), but the core requirement of alleging a specific agreement
remains good law.
Conclusion
To properly plead a RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) in the Fifth
Circuit, the complaint must allege with specificity that at least two persons
agreed to commit a substantive RICO violation, that each defendant knew of
and agreed to the overall objective of the RICO offense, and that the
agreement encompassed the commission of at least two predicate acts of
racketeering as part of the enterprise. The complaint must set forth detailed
factual allegations—tied to the timeline and each defendant’s conduct—
showing the existence of the enterprise, the pattern of racketeering activity,
the nature of the agreement, and each defendant’s knowing participation,
rather than relying on conclusory statements or mere association. Only by
meeting these standards can a RICO conspiracy claim survive dismissal in
the Fifth Circuit.
Legal Authorities
Schnautz v. United States, 263 F.2d 525 (5th Cir. 1959)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
In the court's instructions was included the statement that a conspiracy
'may be proven by overt acts'. The appellant asserts that this is an incorrect
statement of the law and that because of the error we must reverse the
conviction. This is urged on the theory that the jury might consider the
conspiracy proven if the evidence showed that any of the overt acts were
committed. The gist of criminal conspiracy is the agreement between the
conspirators to commit an offense attended by an act of one or more of the
conspirators to effect the object of the conspiracy. United States v. Falcone,
311 U.S. 205, 61 S.Ct. 204, 85 L.Ed. 128; Rent v. United States, 5 Cir., 1954,
209 F.2d 893. Proof of the commission of an overt act might also be evidence
•

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
of an agreement among conspirators depending on the nature of the act and
the character of the proof.
Summary
The essence of a criminal conspiracy is the agreement between conspirators
to commit an offense, accompanied by an act by one or more conspirators to
achieve the conspiracy's objective. This aligns with the requirements for
pleading a RICO conspiracy, where an agreement to engage in a pattern of
racketeering activity is central. The passage also notes that proof of an overt
act can serve as evidence of an agreement, which is pertinent to
establishing the existence of a conspiracy under RICO.
United States v. Rosenthal, 805 F.3d 523 (5th Cir. 2015)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The elements of a conspiracy under § 1962(d) are simply (1) that two or
more people agreed to commit a substantive RICO offense and (2) that the
defendant knew of and agreed to the overall objective of the RICO offense.”
United States v. Pratt, 728 F.3d 463, 477 (5th Cir.2013) (emphasis added)
(internal quotation marks omitted).
Summary
Clear articulation of the elements required to plead a RICO conspiracy
under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) in the Fifth Circuit. It specifies that the plaintiff
must show that two or more people agreed to commit a substantive RICO
offense and that the defendant knew of and agreed to the overall objective of
the RICO offense. This is a general standard applicable to RICO conspiracy
claims in the Fifth Circuit.
Abraham v. Singh, 480 F.3d 351 (5th Cir. 2007)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Plaintiffs have also alleged that Defendants conspired to violate § 1962(a),
(b), and (c). '[B]ecause the core of a RICO civil conspiracy is an agreement
to commit predicate acts, a RICO civil conspiracy complaint, at the very
least, must allege specifically such an agreement.' Crowe, 43 F.3d at 206
(quoting Tel-Phonic Servs., Inc. v. TBS Int'l, Inc., 975 F.2d 1134, 1140 (5th
Cir.1992)). Plaintiffs specifically alleged that the Defendants entered into an
agreement and that each agreed to commit at least two predicate acts of

=== PAGE 24 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
racketeering. These allegations are specific enough to state a claim that the
Defendants conspired to violate § 1962(c).
Summary
The passage provides insight into the requirements for pleading a RICO
conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) in the Fifth Circuit. It emphasizes that
the core of a RICO civil conspiracy is an agreement to commit predicate
acts. Therefore, a RICO civil conspiracy complaint must specifically allege
such an agreement. The passage also notes that the plaintiffs in the case
adequately alleged that the defendants entered into an agreement and
agreed to commit at least two predicate acts of racketeering, which was
sufficient to state a claim under § 1962(c). This indicates that for a RICO
conspiracy claim, it is essential to allege an agreement among the
defendants to commit predicate acts.
Dell Inc. v. Mishra, CAUSE NO.: A-16-CV-00641-SS (W.D. Tex. Aug 03, 2018)
U.S. District Court — Western District of Texas
Extract
Dell alleges all defendants have and continue to conduct fraudulent affairs
as an illegal enterprise in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq. Am. Compl.
[#95] at ¶ 219. Specifically, Dell asserts violations of 18 U.S.C. 1962(c) and
(d) based on the predicate acts of wire fraud and trafficking in counterfeit
services. ... Regardless of the subsection asserted, RICO claims require (1) a
person who engages in (2) a pattern of racketeering activity, (3) connected
to the acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise. In re
Burzynski, 989 F.2d 733, 741 (5th Cir. 1993). ... Dell has failed to plead a
plausible RICO enterprise involving IFN. To begin, Dell fails to distinguish
the pattern of racketeering from the association-in-fact enterprise. ... Dell's §
1962(d) claim against IFN fails for similar reasons. See Benhamou, 190 F.
Supp. 3d at 663 (dismissing § 1962(d) claim against defendant in light of
plaintiff's failure to plead a plausible § 1962(c) claim against the same
defendant).
Summary
Requirements for a RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962, which include
demonstrating a person engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity
connected to an enterprise. For a RICO conspiracy claim under § 1962(d),
the plaintiff must also establish a plausible RICO enterprise under § 1962(c).
The failure to distinguish the pattern of racketeering from the enterprise or
to establish a separate existence for the enterprise can lead to dismissal of
the claim.

"To be convicted of conspiracy to violate RICO there must be proof that the
individual, by his words or actions, objectively manifested an agreement to
participate, directly or indirectly, in the affairs of the enterprise, through the
commission of two or more predicate crimes." United States v. Bright, 630 F.
2d 804, 834 (5th Cir. 1980); accord, United States v. Elliott, 571 F.2d 880,

(1979).
Summary
The passage from U.S. v. Stratton provides a clear standard for pleading a
RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) in the Fifth Circuit. It requires
proof that an individual, through words or actions, showed an agreement to
participate in the enterprise's affairs by committing two or more predicate
crimes. This aligns with the broader understanding of RICO conspiracy,
which focuses on the agreement to further the enterprise's illegal activities.
Chaney v. Dreyfus Service Corp., 595 F.3d 219 (5th Cir. 2010)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
In order to demonstrate a RICO conspiracy under § 1962(d), the Receivers
must demonstrate '(1) that two or more people agreed to commit a
substantive RICO offense and (2) that [DSC] knew of and agreed to the
overall objective of the RICO offense.' United States v. Sharpe, 193 F.3d 852,
869 (5th Cir.1999). A person cannot be held liable for a RICO conspiracy
'merely by evidence that he associated with other... conspirators or by
evidence that places the defendant in a climate of activity that reeks of
something foul.' United States v. Posada-Rios, 158 F.3d 832, 857 (5th Cir.
1998); see Marlin v. Moody Nat. Bank, N.A., 248 Fed.Appx. 534 (5th Cir.
2007). A conspirator must at least know of the conspiracy and 'adopt the
goal of furthering or facilitating the criminal endeavor.' Salinas v. United
States, 522 U.S. 52, 65, 118 S.Ct. 469, 139 L.Ed.2d 352 (1997).
Summary
Legal standards for pleading a RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) in
the Fifth Circuit. It specifies that to establish a RICO conspiracy, it must be
shown that two or more people agreed to commit a substantive RICO offense
and that the defendant knew of and agreed to the overall objective of the
RICO offense. Mere association with conspirators or being in a suspicious
environment is insufficient. The defendant must have knowledge of the

Summary
Legal standards for pleading a RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) in
the Fifth Circuit. It emphasizes that a RICO conspiracy claim requires
specific allegations of an agreement to commit predicate acts. Mere
association with conspirators or being in a suspicious environment is
insufficient for liability. This aligns with the requirement that the complaint
must allege a specific agreement to commit the predicate acts that
constitute racketeering activity.
K&F Rest. Holdings, Ltd. v. Rouse, CIVIL ACTION NO. 16-293-JWD-EWD
(M.D. La. Jul 24, 2018)
U.S. District Court — Middle District of Louisiana
Extract
The core of a civil RICO conspiracy claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) is 'an
agreement to commit predicate acts,' and a complaint alleging such a claim,
'at the very least, must allege specifically such an agreement.' Crowe v.
Henry, 43 F.3d 198, 206 (5th Cir. 1995) (affirming dismissal of civil RICO
conspiracy claims where plaintiff had only conclusorily alleged that
defendants had 'conspired'); see also Snow Ingredients, Inc., 833 F.3d at 526
(affirming dismissal of civil RICO conspiracy claims where complaint alleged

that attorney defendants should have known that their conduct was unlawful
but failed to allege agreement between them).
Summary
To plead a RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) in the Fifth Circuit, a
plaintiff must specifically allege an agreement to commit predicate acts. The
complaint must go beyond conclusory allegations and provide specific facts
that imply an agreement among the defendants to engage in the alleged
racketeering activity. The passage highlights the necessity of alleging a
specific agreement to commit predicate acts as a core element of a RICO
conspiracy claim.
U.S. v. Cauble, 706 F.2d 1322 (5th Cir. 1983)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Section 1962(d) makes illegal a conspiracy to violate RICO's substantive
provisions, requiring the government to prove that the defendant agreed to
participate in the enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering.
Each section requires that the enterprise affect interstate commerce. ... Our
decisions establish that a Sec. 1962(d) conviction requires proof of the
enterprise and racketeering elements plus the defendant's objective
manifestation of intent to participate, either directly or indirectly, in the
affairs of the enterprise. As we stated in Phillips, in order to prove a RICO
conspiracy the government must prove 'the additional element of
agreement.' 664 F.2d at 1012.
Summary
Clear explanation of the legal standards for pleading a RICO conspiracy
under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) in the Fifth Circuit. It specifies that the
government must prove the existence of an enterprise and racketeering
elements, as well as the defendant's agreement to participate in the
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering. The passage also
emphasizes the requirement for the enterprise to affect interstate
commerce.

Movants next argue that Plaintiffs have failed to establish a conspiracy to
violate RICO between the defendants. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), it is
'unlawful for any person to conspire to violate' the substantive portions of
RICO. To allege that a defendant has engaged in a RICO conspiracy, a
plaintiff must plead '(1) that two or more people agreed to commit a
substantive RICO offense and (2) that [they] knew of and agreed to the
overall objective of the RICO offense.' 'The core of a RICO conspiracy is the
allegation of an agreement between the alleged conspirators to commit the
predicate acts. Conclusory allegations of an agreement or conspiracy are not
sufficient, the plaintiff must allege facts implying an agreement to commit
predicate acts of racketeering.'

Northwest Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239 (1989).
Summary
Elements required to plead a RICO claim, which include a person engaging
in a pattern of racketeering activity connected to an enterprise. It
emphasizes the necessity of alleging a pattern of racketeering, which
requires identifying predicate acts with continuity and relationship. This is
applicable to any RICO claim in the Fifth Circuit.

Trevino v. Pechero, 592 F.Supp.2d 939 (S.D. Tex. 2008)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
RICO requires a showing that (1) a person that engages in (2) a pattern of
racketeering activity, (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment,
conduct, or control of an enterprise. Crowe v. Henry, 43 F.3d 198, 204 (5th
Cir.1995) (quoting Delta Truck & Tractor, Inc. v. J.I. Case Co., 855 F.2d 241
(5th Cir.1988)) (emphasis in original). Because RICO is a federal statute, the
racketeering must have at least a minimal nexus with interstate commerce.
R.A.G.S. Couture, Inc. v. Hyatt, 774 F.2d 1350, 1353 (5th Cir.1985).
Summary
Basic elements required to plead a RICO claim in the Fifth Circuit, which
include demonstrating a person engaged in a pattern of racketeering
activity connected to an enterprise. It also emphasizes the necessity of a
minimal nexus with interstate commerce, which is a federal requirement for
RICO claims.
Manax v. McNamara, 660 F.Supp. 657 (W.D. Tex. 1987)
U.S. District Court — Western District of Texas
Extract
The Plaintiffs also allege that the Defendants have violated 18 U.S.C. §
1962(d), which prohibits any conspiracy to engage in the prohibited
activities listed in § 1962(c). In order to properly assert a conspiracy under §
1962(d) to violate § 1962(c), it is not sufficient to demonstrate that an
agreement exists between the Defendants to commit a predicate act. There
must be an agreement to participate, directly or indirectly in the affairs of
the enterprise through the commission of two or more predicate crimes.
United States v. Smith, 574 F.2d 308 (5th Cir.1978). Further, the Fifth
Circuit has established that a viable § 1962(d) claim requires proof of the
enterprise and racketeering elements plus the Defendants' objective
manifestation of intent to participate, either directly or indirectly, in the
affairs of the enterprise.
Summary
Requirements for pleading a RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) in
the Fifth Circuit. It specifies that it is not enough to show an agreement to
commit a predicate act; there must be an agreement to participate in the
enterprise's affairs through the commission of two or more predicate crimes.
Additionally, there must be proof of the enterprise and racketeering
elements, along with the defendants' intent to participate in the enterprise's

affairs. This provides a clear standard for what factual allegations are
necessary to support a RICO conspiracy claim in the Fifth Circuit.

Summary
Clear standard for pleading a RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) in
the Fifth Circuit. It specifies that a plaintiff must allege that two or more
people agreed to commit acts constituting a RICO violation and that the
defendant knew of and agreed to the overall objective of the RICO offense.
This standard is supported by case law from the Fifth Circuit, making it
applicable to similar cases within this jurisdiction.
Word of Faith World Outreach Center Church, Inc. v. Sawyer, 90 F.3d 118
(5th Cir. 1996)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The Church alleges the defendants violated 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) and (d) of
the Racketeer Influence and Corrupt Organization Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. §§
1961-1968. Subsection 1962(c) prohibits persons employed by or associated
with any enterprise from conducting or participating in the enterprise's
affairs through a pattern of racketeering. Subsection 1962(d) prohibits a
conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a), (b), or (c). Under both subsections,
RICO claims require '1) a person who engages in 2) a pattern of
racketeering activity, 3) connected to the acquisition, establishment,
conduct, or control of an enterprise.'

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
Requirements for a RICO claim under subsections 1962(c) and (d), which
include the involvement of a person in a pattern of racketeering activity
connected to an enterprise. Specifically, subsection 1962(d) addresses
conspiracies to violate the substantive RICO provisions. This indicates that
to plead a RICO conspiracy, a plaintiff must allege that the defendants
conspired to engage in a pattern of racketeering activity connected to an
enterprise.
U.S. v. Delgado, 401 F.3d 290 (5th Cir. 2005)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The RICO Act criminalizes conspiracy to violate any of its substantive
provisions. 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d). 'To prove a RICO conspiracy, the
government must establish (1) that two or more people agreed to commit a
substantive RICO offense and (2) that the defendant knew of and agreed to
the overall objective of the RICO offense.' Posada-Rios, 158 F.3d at 857-58.
These elements may be established by circumstantial evidence. Id. Each
requirement is met here.
Summary
To plead a RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) in the Fifth Circuit,
the government must establish two key elements: (1) an agreement between
two or more people to commit a substantive RICO offense, and (2) the
defendant's knowledge of and agreement to the overall objective of the
RICO offense. These elements can be proven through circumstantial
evidence, which means direct evidence of the agreement or knowledge is
not necessary.
Crowe v. Henry, 43 F.3d 198 (5th Cir. 1995)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Lastly, the defendants are also correct that Crowe has failed to adequately
allege a RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962(d). '[B]ecause the core
of a RICO civil conspiracy is an agreement to commit predicate acts, a RICO
civil conspiracy complaint, at the very least, must allege specifically such an
agreement.' Tel-Phonic, 975 F.2d at 1140 (citing Hecht v. Commerce
Clearing House, Inc., 897 F.2d 21, 25 (2d Cir.1990)). While Crowe has pled
the conclusory allegation that the defendants herein 'conspired,' nowhere
does he allege facts implying any agreement to commit predicate acts of

=== PAGE 32 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
racketeering. Therefore, Crowe's claim under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962(d) must
also fail.
Summary
The passage from Crowe v. Henry provides insight into the requirements for
pleading a RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) in the Fifth Circuit. It
emphasizes that the core of a RICO civil conspiracy is an agreement to
commit predicate acts. Therefore, a RICO civil conspiracy complaint must
specifically allege such an agreement. The failure to allege facts implying an
agreement to commit predicate acts of racketeering will result in the failure
of the RICO conspiracy claim.
Burzynski, In re, 989 F.2d 733 (5th Cir. 1993)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Burzynski has also failed to plead a RICO violation, his last cause of action.
The plaintiff alleges RICO violations under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a), (b), (c), and
(d). Boiled down to their essence in plain English, the subsections state: ...
(d) a person cannot conspire to violate subsections (a), (b), or (c). Thus,
RICO claims under all four subsections necessitate: '1) a person who
engages in 2) a pattern of racketeering activity, 3) connected to the
acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise.' Delta Truck
& Tractor, Inc. v. J.I. Case Co., 855 F.2d 241, 242 (5th Cir.1988), cert. denied,
489 U.S. 1079, 109 S.Ct. 1531, 103 L.Ed.2d 836 (1989) (emphasis in
original).
Summary
Essential elements required to plead a RICO violation under 18 U.S.C. §
1962, including subsection (d) for conspiracy. It specifies that a RICO claim
requires a person to engage in a pattern of racketeering activity connected
to an enterprise. This is a general requirement for RICO claims in the Fifth
Circuit.
U.S. v. Williams, 809 F.2d 1072 (5th Cir. 1987)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Because we find the evidence sufficient to show that Orellana agreed to
personally commit at least two racketeering acts, we need not reach the
question whether conviction under a Sec. 1962(d) conspiracy to violate Sec.
1962(c) requires agreement of the individual to personally commit two

=== PAGE 33 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
racketeering acts as opposed to an agreement that the enterprise commit
two racketeering acts.
Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, for a RICO conspiracy charge under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d),
it is not necessary to prove that an individual defendant agreed to personally
commit two racketeering acts. Instead, it is sufficient to show that the
defendant agreed that the enterprise would commit two racketeering acts.
This suggests that the focus is on the agreement to further the enterprise's
criminal objectives rather than the individual's personal commission of acts.
Tel-Phonic Services, Inc. v. TBS Intern., Inc., 975 F.2d 1134 (5th Cir. 1992)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Plaintiffs also allege the existence of a conspiracy 'to defraud plaintiffs.' Am.
Compl. p 44. While Plaintiffs have pleaded the conclusory allegation that the
Defendants 'conspired,' they have not pleaded the elements of a RICO
conspiracy. The complaint does not allege facts implying any agreement
involving each of the Defendants to commit at least two predicate acts. We
agree with the Second Circuit that '[b]ecause the core of a RICO civil
conspiracy is an agreement to commit predicate acts, a RICO civil
conspiracy complaint, at the very least, must allege specifically such an
agreement.' Hecht v. Commerce Clearing House, Inc., 897 F.2d 21, 25 (2d
Cir.1990); see also Glessner v. Kenny, 952 F.2d 702, 714 (3d Cir.1991) (civil
RICO conspiracy claim must plead agreement to commit predicate acts and
knowledge that the acts were part of a pattern of racketeering activity);
Miranda v. Ponce Fed. Bank, 948 F.2d 41, 47 (1st Cir.1991) (civil RICO
conspiracy claim must charge that defendants knowingly entered into an
agreement to commit two or more predicate crimes). Accordingly, because
the complaints fail to plead specifically any agreement to commit predicate
acts of racketeering, the RICO conspiracy claim was also properly
dismissed.
Summary
The passage outlines that for a RICO conspiracy claim under 18 U.S.C. §
1962(d) in the Fifth Circuit, the complaint must specifically allege an
agreement among the defendants to commit at least two predicate acts of
racketeering. It is not sufficient to merely allege that the defendants
conspired; the complaint must detail the agreement and the knowledge that
the acts were part of a pattern of racketeering activity. This aligns with the
requirements in other circuits, emphasizing the need for specificity in
pleading the agreement to commit predicate acts.

United States v. Posada-Rios, 158 F.3d 832, 857 (5th Cir. 1998).
Summary
Clear standard for what is required to prove a RICO conspiracy in the Fifth
Circuit. It specifies that the government must show an agreement between
two or more people to commit a substantive RICO offense and that the
defendant was aware of and agreed to the overall objective of the RICO
offense. This standard is applicable to any RICO conspiracy case within the
Fifth Circuit.
United States v. Pratt, 728 F.3d 463 (5th Cir. 2013)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Pratt was charged under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) with conspiring to violate a
substantive RICO provision, § 1962(c). The elements of a conspiracy under §
1962(d) are simply “(1) that two or more people agreed to commit a
substantive RICO offense and (2) that the defendant knew of and agreed to
the overall objective of the RICO offense.” The defendant need not be one of
the people who agreed to commit the substantive offense.
Summary
Clear articulation of the elements required to plead a RICO conspiracy
under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) in the Fifth Circuit. It specifies that the
prosecution must demonstrate that two or more individuals agreed to
commit a substantive RICO offense and that the defendant was aware of and
agreed to the overall objective of the RICO offense. Importantly, the
defendant does not need to be one of the individuals who agreed to commit
the substantive offense. This provides a foundational understanding of what
is necessary to establish a RICO conspiracy claim in this jurisdiction.

Extract
Subsection 1962(d) prohibits a conspiracy to violate §§ 1962(a), (b), or (c).
To prevail on a RICO conspiracy claim, North Cypress had to demonstrate
“(1) that two or more people agreed to commit a substantive RICO offense
and (2) that [the defendants] knew of and agreed to the overall objective of
the RICO offense.” Since North Cypress failed to properly plead a claim
under §§ 1962(a), (b), or (c), it correspondingly failed to properly plead a
claim under § 1962(d).
Summary
Requirements for pleading a RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) in
the Fifth Circuit. It specifies that a plaintiff must demonstrate that two or
more people agreed to commit a substantive RICO offense and that the
defendants knew of and agreed to the overall objective of the RICO offense.
The passage also highlights that a failure to properly plead a claim under §§
1962(a), (b), or (c) results in a failure to plead a claim under § 1962(d). This
indicates that a RICO conspiracy claim is contingent upon the proper
pleading of a substantive RICO offense.
Peel v. cPaperless LLC, 4:23-CV-02417 (S.D. Tex. Nov 08, 2024)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
To state a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962, a plaintiff must allege
three common elements: “(1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern of
racketeering activity, (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment,
conduct, or control of an enterprise.” N. Cypress Med. Ctr. Operating Co.,
Ltd. v. Cigna Healthcare, 781 F.3d 182, 201 (5th Cir. 2015) (quotation
omitted). [] An act of “racketeering activity,” commonly referred to as a
“predicate act,” is defined to include certain criminal acts, including mail
and wire fraud.
Summary
Elements required to state a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962, which
includes engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity connected to an
enterprise. It specifies that predicate acts, such as mail and wire fraud, are
necessary components of racketeering activity. This is relevant to
understanding the legal standards for pleading a RICO conspiracy in the
Fifth Circuit.

(5th Cir. 2019)

=== PAGE 36 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
RICO creates a private civil action to be brought by '[a]ny person injured in
his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this
chapter ....' Section 1962, which contains RICO’s criminal provision, makes
it 'unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise
engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate ... commerce, to
conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such
enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.' Conspiracy to
violate section 1962 is also unlawful.
Summary
General overview of the RICO statute, specifically highlighting that a private
civil action can be brought by any person injured in their business or
property due to a violation of section 1962. It also clarifies that conspiracy
to violate section 1962 is unlawful, which is directly relevant to
understanding the legal standards for pleading a RICO conspiracy under 18
U.S.C. § 1962(d).
U.S. v. Bright, 630 F.2d 804 (5th Cir. 1980)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
The RICO conspiracy statute provides: 'It shall be unlawful for any person to
conspire to violate any of the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this
section.' 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d). To be convicted of conspiracy to violate RICO
there must be proof that the individual, by his words or actions, objectively
manifested an agreement to participate, directly or indirectly, in the affairs
of the enterprise, through the commission of two or more predicate crimes.
United States v. Elliott, 571 F.2d at 903.
Summary
To plead a RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) in the Fifth Circuit,
there must be evidence that the defendant, through words or actions,
showed an agreement to participate in the enterprise's affairs by committing
two or more predicate crimes. This aligns with the requirement that a RICO
conspiracy involves an agreement to further the criminal objectives of the
enterprise.
U.S. v. Elliott, 571 F.2d 880 (5th Cir. 1978)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit

=== PAGE 37 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
All six defendants were convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) of having
conspired to violate a substantive RICO provision, § 1962(c)... RICO helps to
eliminate this problem by creating a substantive offense which ties together
these diverse parties and crimes. Thus, the object of a RICO conspiracy is to
violate a substantive RICO provision here, to conduct or participate in the
affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity and not
merely to commit each of the predicate crimes necessary to demonstrate a
pattern of racketeering activity. The gravamen of the conspiracy charge in
this case is not that each defendant agreed to commit arson, to steal goods
from interstate commerce, to obstruct justice, and to sell narcotics; rather, it
is that each agreed to participate, directly and indirectly, in the affairs of the
enterprise by committing two or more predicate crimes.
Summary
The passage from U.S. v. Elliott provides insight into the legal standards for
pleading a RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) in the Fifth Circuit. It
clarifies that the object of a RICO conspiracy is to violate a substantive RICO
provision by conducting or participating in the affairs of an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity. The focus is not on the agreement
to commit specific predicate crimes but on the agreement to participate in
the enterprise's affairs by committing two or more predicate crimes. This
understanding is crucial for determining the necessary factual allegations to
support a RICO conspiracy claim.
U.S. v. Posada-Rios, 158 F.3d 832 (5th Cir. 1998)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
To prove a RICO conspiracy the government must establish (1) that two or
more people agreed to commit a substantive RICO offense and (2) that the
defendant knew of and agreed to the overall objective of the RICO offense.
See Marmolejo, 89 F.3d at 1196-97. The government is not required to prove
a conspiracy through direct evidence. Because conspirators normally
attempt to conceal their conduct, the elements of a conspiracy offense may
be established solely by circumstantial evidence. See United States v.
Espinoza-Seanez, 862 F.2d 526, 537 (5th Cir.1988). 'The agreement, a
defendant's guilty knowledge and a defendant's participation in the
conspiracy all may be inferred from the 'development and collocation of
circumstances.'
Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, to plead a RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), it
must be shown that two or more individuals agreed to commit a substantive

=== PAGE 38 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
RICO offense and that the defendant was aware of and agreed to the overall
objective of the RICO offense. Direct evidence is not necessary;
circumstantial evidence can suffice to establish the elements of a conspiracy,

emphasizes that mere association with conspirators is insufficient; there
must be knowledge and intent to further the criminal endeavor.
United Healthcare Sevices, Inc. v. Next Health, LLC
Extract
To establish a civil conspiracy, a plaintiff must prove: (1) a combination of
two or more persons; (2) an object to be accomplished (either an unlawful
purpose or a lawful purpose by unlawful means); (3) a meeting of the minds
on the object or course of action; (4) one or more unlawful, overt acts; and
(5) damages as the proximate result. Ins. Co. of N. Am. v. Morris, 981 S.W.2d

In pursuing this action, D&T brings claims under three subsections of the
RICO statute. See id. §§ 1962 (a), (c) & (d). Though the subsections are
distinct, each shares three common elements: '(1) a person who engages in
(2) a pattern of racketeering activity, (3) connected to the acquisition,

Summary
Three common elements required for a RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962,
which includes § 1962(d) for conspiracy. These elements are: (1) a person
who engages in, (2) a pattern of racketeering activity, and (3) connected to
the acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise. This
provides a clear framework for what factual allegations are necessary to
support a RICO conspiracy claim in the Fifth Circuit.

D&T brings three RICO claims for violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a), (c), and
(d). ... All four subsections of § 1962 have three common elements: '1) a
person who engages in 2) a pattern of racketeering activity, 3) connected to
the acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise.' Crowe,
43 F.3d at 204 (emphasis omitted). ... To establish th[e] pattern [element], a
plaintiff must show both a relationship between the predicate offenses. ..
and the threat of continuing activity. ... 'an enterprise. .. is proved by
evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by evidence
that the various associates function as a continuing unit.' Boyle, 556 U.S. at
945 (quoting United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583 (1981)).

Summary
Common elements required for RICO claims under § 1962, which include a
person engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity connected to an
enterprise. It emphasizes the need for a relationship between predicate
offenses and a threat of continuing activity, as well as evidence of an
ongoing organization functioning as a continuing unit.
57 F.Supp.3d 766 Gordon v. Neugebauer
Extract
Subsection 1962(d) prohibits a conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a), (b),
or (c). See 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d). Because Plaintiff has failed to state a claim
against Defendant Crowley under section 1962(c), he has necessarily failed
to state a claim for conspiracy to violate section 1962(c) under section
1962(d).
Summary
To plead a RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), a plaintiff must first
successfully plead a violation of one of the substantive RICO provisions
under § 1962(a), (b), or (c). If a plaintiff fails to state a claim under these
sections, they cannot successfully plead a conspiracy to violate them under §
1962(d). This implies that the factual allegations required to support a RICO
conspiracy claim must include specific facts that establish a violation of the
substantive RICO provisions.
Gordon v. Neugebauer
Extract
Subsection 1962(d) prohibits a conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a), (b),
or (c). See 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d). Because Plaintiff has failed to state a claim
against Defendants... under section 1962(c), he has necessarily failed to
state a claim for conspiracy to violate section 1962(c) under section 1962(d).
Summary
To plead a RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), a plaintiff must first
establish a valid claim under one of the substantive RICO provisions, such as
§ 1962(c). If a plaintiff fails to establish a claim under the substantive
provisions, they cannot succeed in a conspiracy claim under § 1962(d). This
suggests that the conspiracy claim is contingent upon the existence of a
substantive RICO violation.

Belton v. Regions Bank
Extract
Plaintiff alleges that the defendants 'engaged in a pattern of racketeering
activity' in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
Act ('RICO'), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968. (R. Doc. 1 at 22). To recover under
RICO, the plaintiff must establish three elements: (1) a person who engages
in (2) a pattern of racketeering activity (3) connected to the acquisition,
establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise. Abraham v. Singh, 480 F.
3d 351, 355 (5th Cir. 2007) (quoting Word of Faith World Outreach Ctr.
Church, Inc. v. Sawyer, 90 F.3d 118, 122 (5th Cir. 1996)).
Summary
Elements required to establish a RICO claim in the Fifth Circuit, which
includes demonstrating a person engaged in a pattern of racketeering
activity connected to an enterprise. This is relevant to understanding the
legal standards for pleading a RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d).
667 B.R. 665 Austin v. Baker & Hostetler, LLP (In re Uplift RX, LLC)
Extract
The Complaint also brings a claim for conspiracy to violate federal RICO. To
properly allege a RICO conspiracy, Austin must plausibly allege that (i) two
or more people agreed to commit the acts which constitute the RICO
violation and (ii) that Baker Hostetler knew of and agreed to the overall
objective of the RICO offense. Chaney v. Dreyfus Serv. Corp., 595 F.3d 219,
239 (5th Cir. 2010) (citing United States v. Sharpe, 193 F.3d 852, 869 (5th
Cir. 1999)).
Summary
To plead a RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) in the Fifth Circuit, a
plaintiff must allege that two or more people agreed to commit acts
constituting a RICO violation and that the defendant knew of and agreed to
the overall objective of the RICO offense. This aligns with the legal
standards set forth in Chaney v. Dreyfus Serv. Corp. and United States v.
Sharpe.
Bustos v. Invierte En Tex.
Extract
To state a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962, a plaintiff must allege
three common elements: “(1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern of

racketeering activity, (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment,
conduct, or control of an enterprise.” N. Cypress Med. Ctr. Operating Co.,
Ltd. v. Cigna Healthcare, 781 F.3d 182, 201 (5th Cir. 2015) (quotation
omitted). An act of “racketeering activity,” commonly referred to as a
“predicate act,” is defined to include certain criminal acts, including mail
and wire fraud, and any act indictable under the Immigration and
Nationality Act. See 18 U.S.C § 1961 (defining “racketeering activity”);
Waste Mgmt. of La., L.L.C. v. River Birch, Inc., 920 F.3d 958, 964 (5th Cir.
2019) (referring to racketeering activity as a “predicate act”).
Summary
Elements required to state a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962 in the
Fifth Circuit, which includes engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity
connected to an enterprise. It also specifies that racketeering activity
includes criminal acts like mail and wire fraud. This is relevant to
understanding the legal standards for pleading a RICO conspiracy.
Provost v. First Guar. Bank
Extract
Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1962, It shall be unlawful for any person employed
by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which
affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt. § 1962(c). In order for a
plaintiff to establish liability, he must allege and prove the existence of two
distinct entities: (1) a 'person;' and (2) an 'enterprise.' Cedric Kushner
Promostions, Ltd. v. King, 533 U.S. 158, 161, 121 S.Ct. 2087, 2090, 150
L.Ed.2. 198 (2001).
Summary
To plead a RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) in the Fifth Circuit, a
plaintiff must allege and prove the existence of two distinct entities: a
"person" and an "enterprise." The "person" is an individual or entity capable
of holding a legal or beneficial interest in property, while the "enterprise" is
the entity through which the racketeering activity is conducted. This
requirement is consistent with the Supreme Court's interpretation in Cedric
Kushner Promotions, Ltd. v. King.

Extract
to plead conspiracy adequately, the plaintiff must set forth allegations
addressing a. the period of the conspiracy, b. the object of the conspiracy, c.
the overt acts taken in furtherance of the conspiracy, d. the agreement to
commit predicate acts, and e. knowledge that the acts were part of a pattern
of racketeering activity conducted in such a way as to violate § 1962(a), (b),
or (c); the plaintiff must also establish 3. injury to the plaintiff’s business or
property (§ 6(A)(2)–(3) supra) 4. by reason of (§ 6(A)(4) supra) 5. an overt act
that must also be a predicate act
Summary
Necessary elements to plead a RICO conspiracy, including the period,
object, overt acts, agreement, and knowledge of the conspiracy, as well as
the requirement to show injury to business or property caused by a
predicate act. This is generally applicable to RICO claims and provides a
framework for what factual allegations are needed.
Chapter 7. Pleading and Practice Issues
Civil RICO: A Definitive Guide. Fifth Edition - American Bar
Association - Gregory P. Joseph
Extract
Section 1962(d) is treated a bit differently. Conspiracy is not 'fraud' for
pleading purposes. Hence, Rule 9(b) does not apply to conspiracy
allegations filed under § 1962(d). However, courts have tended to expand, in
substance, the scope of Rule 9(b)’s particularity.
Summary
While Rule 9(b), which requires particularity in pleading fraud, does not
apply to RICO conspiracy allegations under § 1962(d), courts have expanded
the scope of Rule 9(b) in substance. This suggests that while the technical
requirements of Rule 9(b) do not apply, there is an expectation of a certain
level of detail in the allegations to support a RICO conspiracy claim.
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.
American Criminal Law Review - Georgetown University Law Center -
Bailey, Lisa Pritchard - 1999-06-22

The circuits are split on the specific standing requirements for a civil action
under [sections] 1962(a).(382) To allege a violation of [sections] 1962(a), a

=== PAGE 45 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
plaintiff must show that someone had (1) received income from a pattern of
racketeering activity; and (2) used or invested this income in a RICO
enterprise.(383) ... At least two circuits, however, have required in civil
RICO cases that the plaintiff establish the nexus between its injury and the
investment of the racketeering proceeds. See Crowe v. Henry, 43 F.3d 198,
205 (5th Cir. 1995) ('Under subsections (a) and (b) [of [sections] 1962],
there must be a nexus between the claimed RICO violations and the injury
suffered by the plaintiff. For subsection (a), this means that the injury must
flow from the investment of racketeering income into the enterprise.'); ...
(385.) See Crowe, 43 F. 3d at 205; Vemco v. Camardella, 23 F.3d 129, 133
(6th Cir. 1994) (requiring plaintiff to 'plead a specific injury to plaintiff
caused by the investment of income into the racketeering enterprise,
distinct from any injuries caused by the predicate acts of racketeering').
Summary
The passage provides insight into the Fifth Circuit's requirement for a nexus
between the injury and the investment of racketeering proceeds in a RICO
enterprise. It highlights the need for a plaintiff to demonstrate that their
injury directly results from the investment of racketeering income, not just
from the predicate acts themselves.
Chapter 3. Standing
Civil RICO: A Definitive Guide. Fifth Edition - American Bar
Association - Gregory P. Joseph
Extract
holding that RICO standing requires a plaintiff suing under § 1962(d) to
allege injury from an overt act that is itself a predicate act. This is consistent
with the requirement that a RICO plaintiff has standing under § 1964(c) only
if and to the extent that the plaintiff has suffered cognizable injury caused
by a violation of one of the statutes listed in § 1961(1). See, e.g., Sedima,
S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496–97 (1985) (a RICO “plaintiff only has
standing if, and can only recover to the extent that, he has been injured in
his business or property by the conduct constituting the violation...
Summary
To plead a RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), a plaintiff must allege
an injury from an overt act that is itself a predicate act. This aligns with the
requirement that a RICO plaintiff must have suffered a cognizable injury
caused by a violation of one of the statutes listed in § 1961(1). The passage
references the Sedima case, which clarifies that a RICO plaintiff only has
standing if they have been injured in their business or property by the
conduct constituting the violation.

Reflections on Reves v. Ernst & Young: its meaning and impact on
substantive, accessory, aiding abetting and conspiracy liability under RICO.
American Criminal Law Review - Georgetown University Law Center -
Blakey, G. Robert - 1996-01-01
Extract
The statutory language, however, does not require proof that a defendant
participated personally, or agreed to participate personally, in two predicate
offenses. Read in context, [sections] 1962(d) makes it unlawful to conspire to
conduct or participate in the conduct of an enterprise's affairs, where its
affairs are conducted through a pattern of racketeering activity.) (citations
omitted); Carter, 721 F.2d at 1528-31 (stating that When ... a defendant
agreed to participate in the conduct of an enterprise's affairs with the
objective of violating a substantive RICO provision, it is not necessary that
the defendant agree to personally commit two predicate acts for the
required pattern of racketeering activity. It is enough that the defendant
agreed to the commission of two predicate acts.).
Summary
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), a defendant does not need to personally commit
or agree to commit two predicate acts to be liable for a RICO conspiracy.
Instead, it is sufficient if the defendant agreed to participate in the conduct
of an enterprise's affairs with the objective of violating a substantive RICO
provision, and agreed to the commission of two predicate acts.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity.
The practitioner through their pleadings must articulate with great care and
attention a viable racketeering conspiracy. The court must read the facts
alleged in the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. But a
plaintiff who is unable to identify the enterprise, satisfy the pattern
requirement, or plead other statutory elements with sufficient specificity can
be subject to a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
12(b)(6). Additionally, to the extent that any predicate acts sound in fraud,
the pleading of those acts must satisfy the particularity requirements of
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), which provides: 'In alleging fraud or

=== PAGE 47 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
mistake, a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting
fraud or mistake. Malice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a
person’s mind may be alleged generally.'
Summary
To plead a RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), a plaintiff must allege
conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. Each
element must be adequately pleaded, especially when the predicate acts
involve fraud, which must be detailed with particularity under Federal Rule
of Civil Procedure 9(b). The court will read the complaint in the light most
favorable to the plaintiff, but failure to meet these requirements can lead to
dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6).
Insurance Fraud is a Violent Crime.
Insurance Advocate - CINN Group, Inc. - 2024-03-01
Extract
RICO CONSPIRACY The essence of a RICO conspiracy is the existence of an
agreement to violate RICO's substantive provisions. RICO conspiracy was
established by proof of: (a) of an agreement to join a racketeering scheme,
(b) of the defendant's knowing engagement in the scheme with the intent
that its overall goals be effectuated, and (c) that the scheme involved, or by
agreement between any members of the conspiracy was intended to involve,
two or more predicate acts of racketeering.
Summary
Clear outline of the elements necessary to establish a RICO conspiracy: an
agreement to join a racketeering scheme, knowing engagement with intent
to effectuate the scheme's goals, and involvement of two or more predicate
acts of racketeering. This aligns with the general legal standards for
pleading a RICO conspiracy.
Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's
Arsenal
Extract
RICO is not a simple statute. It pertains to conduct associated with an
'enterprise' and 'a pattern racketeering activity.' An enterprise is an
individual or legal entity, or a union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity, while a pattern of racketeering activity requires
long-term, organized conduct to violate state and federal laws. ... Second, to
prove most types of RICO claims, the plaintiff must plead that the defendant
committed some qualifying criminal action, the most common of which is

=== PAGE 48 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
mail, wire or securities fraud. ... Third, the plaintiff must plead a pattern of
racketeering activity for most RICO claims. If the alleged conduct occurred
once or twice, or was not continuous, it cannot form a pattern of conduct
sufficient to support a RICO claim. ... Fourth, for most RICO claims, the
plaintiff also must plead that the alleged 'person' and 'enterprise,' as defined
in RICO, are distinct.
Summary
General requirements for pleading a RICO claim, which include
demonstrating an association with an enterprise, a pattern of racketeering
activity, and distinctiveness between the person and the enterprise. These
elements are essential for establishing a RICO claim, including a RICO
conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d).
RICO: A Primer
Extract
Under Section 1962(d), it is a violation to conspire to commit any of the
three substantive RICO offenses. To prove a violation of Section 1962(d), a
plaintiff must prove the following elements: The existence of an enterprise
(or that an enterprise would exist); That the enterprise was (or would be)
engaged in, or its activities affected (or would affect), interstate or foreign
commerce; and That each defendant knowingly agreed that a conspirator
would commit a violation of 18 U.S.C. ' 1962(c). The Supreme Court held
that to establish a RICO conspiracy offense under Section 1962(d), there is
no requirement that the defendant 'himself committed or agreed to commit
the two predicate acts requisite for a substantive RICO offense under '
1962(c).
Summary
Elements necessary to plead a RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d). It
specifies that a plaintiff must demonstrate the existence of an enterprise,
that the enterprise's activities affected interstate or foreign commerce, and
that each defendant knowingly agreed that a conspirator would commit a
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). Importantly, the Supreme Court has clarified
that a defendant does not need to have committed or agreed to commit the
predicate acts themselves to be liable for a RICO conspiracy.
