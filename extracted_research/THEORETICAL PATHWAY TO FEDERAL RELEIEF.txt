Question
if a litigant discovers a large amount of fraud, jurisdictional defects, fraud
on the court, extrinsic fraud, and it's admitted on the record in the final trial
for divorce, but judgment has not yet been rendered, can he seek federal
relief emergency to prevent the final decree from being signed and restore
his constitutional rights? i don't care about generals. assume everything
here is true? Younger absention doesnt apply because the case was
admittedly filed in bad faith and wasn't prosecuted for over a year. Rooker-
feldman doesn't apply because the final judgment hasn't been signed yet.
Only research ways it CAN BE DONE, not general barriers.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
Federal courts are generally barred from enjoining ongoing state divorce
proceedings, but there are extremely narrow exceptions—such as when a
federal statute expressly authorizes intervention or when constitutional due
process violations render the state process fundamentally void—though
these are rarely met and require extraordinary circumstances. The most
viable path to emergency federal relief would be to demonstrate that the
state court’s actions are so constitutionally deficient (e.g., for lack of
jurisdiction or egregious due process violations) that federal intervention is
necessary under an express statutory exception or to prevent irreparable
constitutional harm.
Summary
Federal law, particularly the Anti-Injunction Act, sharply limits the ability of
federal courts to intervene in ongoing state court proceedings, including
divorce cases, with only three recognized exceptions: express congressional
authorization, necessity to aid federal jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate
a federal judgment. However, if a litigant can show that the state court
process is fundamentally void due to jurisdictional defects or egregious due
process violations—such as lack of notice or fraud on the court—there may
be a theoretical path to federal emergency relief, especially if a specific
federal statute authorizes such intervention or if constitutional rights are at
imminent risk of irreparable harm.
The case law provided underscores that, while federal courts are highly
deferential to state court processes and expect litigants to exhaust state
remedies, there are rare circumstances where federal intervention is
possible, particularly when constitutional rights are at stake and state
remedies are inadequate or unavailable. In practice, the burden to meet
these exceptions is extremely high, and the litigant must present compelling
evidence that the state court’s actions are void or constitutionally infirm,
and that no adequate remedy exists within the state system.

Background and Relevant Law
The Anti-Injunction Act and Federal-State Court Relations
The principal federal statutory barrier to federal court intervention in
ongoing state proceedings is the Anti-Injunction Act, codified at 28 U.S.C. §
2283. This statute prohibits federal courts from granting injunctions to stay
proceedings in state courts except under three narrowly defined
circumstances: (1) where expressly authorized by an Act of Congress, (2)
where necessary in aid of the federal court’s jurisdiction, or (3) where
necessary to protect or effectuate the federal court’s judgments. This
framework is designed to preserve the autonomy of state courts and to
respect the principles of federalism and comity.
In Cantu v. Moore, 1:23-CV-1476-RP (W.D. Tex. Mar 15, 2024), the federal
district court reaffirmed that these exceptions are strictly construed and
that, absent a clear fit within one of these categories, federal courts must
refrain from interfering with state court proceedings. The court emphasized
that even when constitutional rights are implicated, the preferred course is
for litigants to pursue their claims through the state appellate process,
unless a specific federal statute provides otherwise or the other narrow
exceptions apply.
Due Process, Void Judgments, and Collateral Attack
The Texas Supreme Court in In re E.R., 385 S.W.3d 552, 55 Tex. Sup. Ct. J.
1130 (Tex. 2012) addressed the issue of constitutional due process violations
in state court proceedings. The court held that when a judgment is rendered
without constitutionally adequate notice or in the absence of personal
jurisdiction, such a judgment is void and may be subject to collateral attack,
even if statutory deadlines for challenging the judgment have passed. The
court cited U.S. Supreme Court precedent to support the principle that
constitutional demands override procedural bars, and that state statutes
cannot foreclose challenges to void judgments based on due process
violations.
While In re E.R. arose in the context of a parental rights termination case,
its reasoning is broadly applicable to civil and family law cases in Texas,
including divorce proceedings. The case stands for the proposition that
constitutional defects—such as lack of notice, lack of jurisdiction, or fraud
that undermines the integrity of the judicial process—can render a judgment
void and open the door to extraordinary relief, including collateral attack.
Analysis
Application of the Anti-Injunction Act
The Anti-Injunction Act is the primary federal statutory barrier to enjoining
state court proceedings. Under Cantu v. Moore, federal courts are generally

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
prohibited from intervening in ongoing state cases, including divorce
actions, unless one of the three statutory exceptions applies.
Express Authorization by Congress: The first exception requires that
a federal statute expressly authorize federal court intervention in state
proceedings. Examples include certain civil rights statutes (such as 42
U.S.C. § 1983) in cases of egregious constitutional violations. However,
even under these statutes, federal courts are cautious and typically
require a showing that state remedies are inadequate or unavailable,
and that irreparable harm will result absent federal intervention.
Aid of Federal Jurisdiction: The second exception applies when
federal intervention is necessary to preserve the federal court’s own
jurisdiction. This is rarely applicable in family law cases, as federal
courts generally lack jurisdiction over divorce and related matters
under the domestic relations exception.
Protect or Effectuate Federal Judgments: The third exception
allows federal courts to enjoin state proceedings to protect or
effectuate their own judgments. This is not relevant where, as here, no
prior federal judgment exists.
In the scenario described, the only plausible path to federal relief would be
under the first exception—if a federal statute expressly authorizes
intervention to prevent irreparable constitutional harm, such as through a
civil rights action alleging denial of due process or equal protection.
Due Process Violations and Void Judgments
In re E.R. establishes that when a state court judgment is void due to lack of
jurisdiction or constitutionally inadequate notice, procedural barriers such
as statutory deadlines do not prevent a collateral attack. This principle is
rooted in the supremacy of constitutional rights over procedural rules. If a
litigant can demonstrate that the state court proceeding is fundamentally
void—due to fraud, lack of jurisdiction, or egregious due process violations—
then extraordinary relief may be available, even if the judgment has not yet
been rendered.
However, In re E.R. is a Texas Supreme Court case and addresses the
availability of collateral attack within the state court system. It does not
directly authorize federal court intervention, but it does support the
argument that constitutional defects can render a state court process void
and subject to extraordinary remedies.
Fraud on the Court and Extrinsic Fraud
The scenario posits that fraud on the court, extrinsic fraud, and
jurisdictional defects have been admitted on the record. Fraud on the court
—particularly extrinsic fraud that prevents a party from fully participating in
the proceedings—can be grounds for setting aside or enjoining a judgment.
If the fraud is so severe that it undermines the integrity of the judicial

process and deprives a party of due process, this may rise to the level of a
constitutional violation.
Federal courts have recognized that in cases of egregious fraud or
deprivation of constitutional rights, extraordinary relief may be warranted.
However, the standard is extremely high, and federal courts will generally
require that the litigant exhaust all available state remedies before
intervening, unless it is clear that state remedies are inadequate or
unavailable.
Emergency Federal Relief: Theoretical Pathways
Given the strict limitations of the Anti-Injunction Act and the deference to
state court processes, the only viable path to emergency federal relief would
be to demonstrate that:
The state court proceeding is fundamentally void due to lack of
jurisdiction or egregious due process violations (as recognized in In re
E.R.).
A specific federal statute (such as 42 U.S.C. § 1983) expressly
authorizes federal court intervention to prevent irreparable
constitutional harm.
State remedies are inadequate or unavailable, and immediate federal
intervention is necessary to prevent irreparable injury to constitutional
rights.
If these elements are met, a litigant could file an emergency action in
federal court seeking injunctive relief to prevent the state court from
entering a final decree. The litigant would need to present compelling
evidence of the constitutional violations and the inadequacy of state
remedies.
Exceptions and Caveats
Exhaustion of State Remedies: Federal courts are highly reluctant to
intervene in ongoing state proceedings, especially where state
appellate remedies are available. The litigant must demonstrate that
state remedies are inadequate or unavailable, or that irreparable harm
will result absent immediate federal intervention.
Narrow Construction of Exceptions: The exceptions to the Anti-
Injunction Act are strictly construed. The burden is on the litigant to
show that the case fits squarely within one of the exceptions.
Domestic Relations Exception: Federal courts generally lack
jurisdiction over divorce and related family law matters, except where
constitutional rights are at stake and a specific federal statute
authorizes intervention.
No Final Judgment: The absence of a final judgment means that the
Rooker-Feldman doctrine does not apply, but it also means that the
state court process is ongoing, and federal courts will be even more
hesitant to intervene.
Comity and Federalism: Even in cases of alleged constitutional
violations, federal courts are mindful of the need to respect state court

processes and will intervene only in the most extraordinary
circumstances.
Conclusion
In summary, while federal courts are generally barred from enjoining
ongoing state divorce proceedings, there are extremely narrow exceptions
where federal intervention may be possible—specifically, where a federal
statute expressly authorizes such relief or where the state court process is
so constitutionally deficient as to be void. The most viable path to
emergency federal relief would be to demonstrate that the state court’s
actions are fundamentally void due to lack of jurisdiction or egregious due
process violations, and that no adequate state remedy exists. However, the
burden to meet these exceptions is extremely high, and federal courts will
require compelling evidence of constitutional harm and the inadequacy of
state remedies before granting emergency relief. The principles articulated
in Cantu v. Moore, 1:23-CV-1476-RP (W.D. Tex. Mar 15, 2024) and In re E.R.,
385 S.W.3d 552, 55 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1130 (Tex. 2012) provide the legal
framework for analyzing such claims, but in practice, federal intervention in
ongoing state divorce proceedings remains exceedingly rare and difficult to
obtain.

Texas Supreme Court
Extract
See Tulsa Prof'l, 485 U.S. at 491, 108 S.Ct. 1340 (holding that due process
violation made judgment vulnerable to attack even though challenge filed
beyond statutory two-month deadline); Peralta v. Heights Med. Ctr. Inc., 485
U.S. 80, 86, 108 S.Ct. 896, 99 L.Ed.2d 75 (1988) (concluding that Texas bill-
of-review requirements must yield to constitutional demands of due
process); Browning v. Prostok, 165 S.W.3d 336, 346 (Tex.2005) (recognizing
that judgment void for lack of personal jurisdiction could be collaterally
attacked)... Accordingly, the statute cannot place a temporal limit on a
challenge to a void judgment filed by a defendant who did not receive the
type of notice to which she was constitutionally entitled... We reach the
same conclusion here: the statute's time limits cannot foreclose an attack by
a parent who was deprived of constitutionally adequate notice.
Summary
The case establishes that constitutional due process defects (e.g., lack of
adequate notice, jurisdictional voidness) cannot be barred by statutory
deadlines and allow collateral attacks on judgments. It supports emergency
and extraordinary relief to set aside or prevent enforcement of orders
tainted by due process violations. While In re E.R. is a termination case, its
principles extend to Texas civil/family cases where judgments are void or

obtained without constitutionally adequate notice, and it recognizes
collateral attack mechanisms notwithstanding procedural bars.
Cantu v. Moore, 1:23-CV-1476-RP (W.D. Tex. Mar 15, 2024)
U.S. District Court — Western District of Texas
Extract
Under the Anti-Injunction Act, a ‘court of the United States may not grant an
injunction to stay proceedings in a state court except as expressly
authorized by Act of Congress, or where necessary, in aid of its jurisdiction,
or to protect of effectuate its judgments.’ 28 U.S.C. § 2283. This statute is
generally recognized to permit a district court to enjoin state court
proceedings on only three bases: When it is (1) expressly authorized by a
federal statute, (2) necessary to assert jurisdiction, or (3) necessary to
protect or effectuate a prior judgment by a federal court. ... An injunction is
not necessary to assert the Court’s jurisdiction in this case. ... Instead,
Plaintiff has an adequate alternative remedy. ... This Court ... must be
mindful of principles of comity and federalism when considering interfering
with state civil proceedings, even where a plaintiff’s First Amendment rights
are potentially involved. ... Plaintiff must instead assert his First Amendment
claims through the state appellate process.
Summary
The passage explains that federal district courts generally cannot enjoin
ongoing state proceedings, with only three narrow § 2283 exceptions: (1)
expressly authorized by Congress, (2) necessary in aid of federal
jurisdiction, or (3) to protect/effectuate a federal judgment. It emphasizes
using state appellate remedies and comity. It does not identify an affirmative
path specific to pre-judgment divorce cases, but it frames the limited lanes
where federal relief could be pursued if one of the § 2283 exceptions fits
(e.g., an expressly authorized statute).
