Question
Judicial immunity is intended to protect independent judicial decision-
making, not to shield judges from liability for egregious, nonjudicial, or
jurisdictionless conduct. Courts have recognized that judicial immunity does
not extend to acts that are nonjudicial or taken in the complete absence of
jurisdiction, to preserve the integrity of the judiciary and protect litigants
from abuse. (Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349 (1978); Mireles v. Waco, 502
U.S. 9 (1991)). Allowing immunity for fraudulent or coercive acts taken
without jurisdiction would undermine public confidence in the judiciary and
is not supported by precedent.
Answer (Fifth Circuit)
Short response
Judicial immunity is not absolute: it does not protect judges from liability for
actions that are nonjudicial in nature or taken in the complete absence of all
jurisdiction. This limitation is well established in Supreme Court and Fifth
Circuit precedent, which consistently holds that immunity is designed to
safeguard independent judicial decision-making, not to shield judges from
accountability for egregious, fraudulent, or jurisdictionless conduct.
Summary
The doctrine of judicial immunity exists to ensure that judges can make
decisions independently and without fear of personal liability, thereby
protecting the integrity of the judicial process. However, courts have
repeatedly emphasized that this immunity is not unlimited: it does not
extend to acts that are nonjudicial or to actions taken in the complete
absence of jurisdiction, as such conduct falls outside the core purpose of the
doctrine and would undermine public trust in the judiciary.
Supreme Court cases such as Stump v. Sparkman and Mireles v. Waco, as
well as numerous Fifth Circuit and district court decisions, have consistently
reaffirmed these two exceptions to judicial immunity. The distinction
between acts taken in excess of jurisdiction (which are generally immune)
and those taken in the clear absence of all jurisdiction (which are not) is
critical, as is the requirement that the act in question be judicial in nature.
This framework ensures that judges remain protected when acting within
their lawful authority, but are not insulated from liability for egregious
abuses of power or for conduct wholly outside their judicial role.

Background and Relevant Law
Case Law
The doctrine of judicial immunity in the United States is rooted in the need
to protect judges from personal liability for their judicial acts, thereby
allowing them to exercise independent judgment without fear of retribution.
However, the Supreme Court and lower federal courts have long recognized
that this immunity is not absolute.
The leading Supreme Court authorities are Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U.S.
349 (1978), and Mireles v. Waco, 502 U.S. 9 (1991). These cases, as well as
subsequent Fifth Circuit and district court decisions, establish two critical
exceptions to judicial immunity:
Nonjudicial Acts: Judges are not immune from liability for actions that
are not taken in their judicial capacity. The determination of whether an
act is judicial depends on the nature of the act itself, not merely the
identity of the actor or the context in which it occurs. For example, acts
motivated by personal objectives or undertaken outside the context of a
judicial proceeding are not protected (Harper v. Merckle, 638 F.2d 848
(5th Cir. 1981)).
Complete Absence of Jurisdiction: Even if an act is judicial in
nature, immunity does not apply if the judge acts in the complete
absence of all jurisdiction. The distinction between acts in excess of
jurisdiction (which remain protected) and acts in the clear absence of
jurisdiction (which are not) is well established. For instance, a criminal
court judge convicting a defendant of a nonexistent crime acts in
excess of jurisdiction and is immune, but a probate judge trying a
criminal case acts in the clear absence of jurisdiction and is not
(Brewer v. Blackwell, 692 F.2d 387 (5th Cir. 1982); Stump v. Sparkman,
435 U.S. 349 (1978)).
These principles are consistently reaffirmed in recent district court
decisions within the Fifth Circuit, which repeatedly cite Mireles and Stump
as controlling authority (Andrews v. Murphy, 1-23-CV-0950-RP (W.D. Tex.
Nov 15, 2023); Foreman v. United States Marshal's Serv., Civil Action
23-0817 (E.D. La. Jun 07, 2023); Nat'l Ass'n for the Advancement of Colored
People v. Reeves, Civil Action 3:23-CV-272-HTW-LGI (S.D. Miss. Jun 01,
2023); Ellsberry v. Stewart, Civil Action 1:21-cv-00385-BWR (S.D. Miss. Mar
06, 2023); Campbell v. Booth, Civil Action 2:22-CV-00052 (S.D. Tex. Apr 15,
2022); Gokey v. Economidy, SA-21-CV-00987-XR (W.D. Tex. Feb 08, 2022)).
The Fifth Circuit has also provided detailed guidance on the application of
these exceptions, emphasizing that the policy behind judicial immunity is to
protect judicial independence, not to provide a shield for egregious or
abusive conduct (Davis v. Tarrant County, Tex., 565 F.3d 214 (5th Cir. 2009); 
Ballard v. Wall, 413 F.3d 510 (5th Cir. 2005); Malina v. Gonzales, 994 F.2d
1121 (5th Cir. 1993)).

It is important to note that Malina v. Gonzales was reheard by the Fifth
Circuit in Malina v. Gonzales, 1 F.3d 304 (5th Cir. 1993). However, the core
holding regarding the exceptions to judicial immunity—nonjudicial acts and
acts taken in the complete absence of jurisdiction—remains consistent with
Supreme Court precedent and is reaffirmed in subsequent cases.
Secondary Materials
Secondary sources further clarify the doctrine’s boundaries. They explain
that judicial immunity is available only when judges act within their judicial
function and jurisdiction, and that immunity does not extend to acts outside
the court’s reach or to nonjudicial conduct (Judicial Immunity (2005); What
kind of immunity? Federal officers, state criminal law, and the Supremacy
Clause. (2003); Immunity Under Section 1983, Vol. 65 No. 06 Pg. 30 (1996); 
When the Defendant Is the Judge, Vol. 18 No. 9 Pg. 1747 (1989)). These
materials reinforce the distinction between acts in excess of jurisdiction
(which are immune) and acts in the clear absence of jurisdiction (which are
not), and emphasize that only judicial acts are protected.
Analysis
Purpose and Scope of Judicial Immunity
The primary purpose of judicial immunity is to protect judges from personal
liability for their judicial acts, thereby ensuring that they can make decisions
independently and without fear of personal consequences (Nat'l Ass'n for
the Advancement of Colored People v. Reeves, Civil Action 3:23-CV-272-
HTW-LGI (S.D. Miss. Jun 01, 2023)). This protection is essential to the
functioning of the judiciary, as it allows judges to rule impartially and
without undue influence.
However, the doctrine is not intended to provide a blanket shield for all
conduct by judges. The Supreme Court and lower courts have consistently
held that judicial immunity does not extend to actions that are nonjudicial in
nature or taken in the complete absence of jurisdiction. This limitation is
critical to maintaining public confidence in the judiciary and ensuring that
judges are held accountable for egregious abuses of power.
The Two Exceptions: Nonjudicial Acts and Absence of
Jurisdiction
Nonjudicial Acts
Judicial immunity does not apply to actions that are not taken in a judge’s
judicial capacity. The determination of whether an act is judicial depends on
the nature of the act itself, not merely the context or the identity of the
actor. For example, if a judge uses their office to pursue personal objectives
or acts outside the context of a judicial proceeding, such conduct is not
protected (Harper v. Merckle, 638 F.2d 848 (5th Cir. 1981)). The Fifth
Circuit has emphasized that when a judge acts out of personal motivation

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
and not in response to a party invoking the judicial process, those acts are
nonjudicial and not immune.
This principle is consistently reaffirmed in recent district court decisions,
which hold that judicial immunity is overcome when the actions in question
are nonjudicial (Andrews v. Murphy, 1-23-CV-0950-RP (W.D. Tex. Nov 15,
2023); Foreman v. United States Marshal's Serv., Civil Action 23-0817 (E.D.
La. Jun 07, 2023); Jones v. Wallace, Civil Action 22-1753 (E.D. La. Aug 08,
2022); Leone v. Magistrate Judges of Travis Cnty. Circuit Court, A-18-
CA-560-LY (W.D. Tex. Aug 08, 2018)).
Complete Absence of Jurisdiction
Even if an act is judicial in nature, immunity does not apply if the judge acts
in the complete absence of all jurisdiction. The distinction between acts in
excess of jurisdiction (which are immune) and acts in the clear absence of
jurisdiction (which are not) is well established. For example, a judge who
acts outside the subject matter jurisdiction of their court—such as a probate
judge presiding over a criminal trial—acts in the clear absence of
jurisdiction and is not protected by judicial immunity (Brewer v. Blackwell,
692 F.2d 387 (5th Cir. 1982); Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349 (1978)).
This principle is consistently applied in both appellate and district court
decisions within the Fifth Circuit (Davis v. Tarrant County, Tex., 565 F.3d 214
(5th Cir. 2009); Ballard v. Wall, 413 F.3d 510 (5th Cir. 2005); Friston v.
MDOC, CAUSE NO. 1:17-cv-329-HSO-JCG (S.D. Miss. Apr 02, 2019); Felton
v. Wells Fargo Bank, CAUSE NO. 5:12-cv-139(DCB)(MTP) (S.D. Miss. Sep 27,
2013); Calderon v. Bandera Cnty., CIVIL NO. SA-14-CA-881-XR (PMA) (W.D.
Tex. Dec 01, 2014)).
Distinction Between Excess of Jurisdiction and Absence of
Jurisdiction
The distinction between acts in excess of jurisdiction and acts in the clear
absence of jurisdiction is critical. Acts in excess of jurisdiction—where a
judge has some arguable basis for authority—are generally protected by
immunity, even if the judge acts erroneously, maliciously, or corruptly
(Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349 (1978); Immunity Under Section 1983,
Vol. 65 No. 06 Pg. 30 (1996)). In contrast, acts taken in the clear absence of
all jurisdiction—where the judge has no authority whatsoever—are not
protected (Brewer v. Blackwell, 692 F.2d 387 (5th Cir. 1982); Holloway v.
Walker, 765 F.2d 517 (5th Cir. 1985)).
This distinction is illustrated by the example, cited in both case law and
secondary materials, of a probate judge presiding over a criminal trial. Such
an act is so far outside the judge’s jurisdiction that immunity does not apply
(Brewer v. Blackwell, 692 F.2d 387 (5th Cir. 1982); Judicial Immunity
(2000)).

Policy Considerations
The rationale for these exceptions is to preserve the integrity of the judiciary
and protect litigants from abuse. Allowing immunity for fraudulent, coercive,
or egregious acts taken without jurisdiction would undermine public
confidence in the judicial system and is not supported by precedent (Nat'l
Ass'n for the Advancement of Colored People v. Reeves, Civil Action 3:23-
CV-272-HTW-LGI (S.D. Miss. Jun 01, 2023); Ballard v. Wall, 413 F.3d 510 (5th
Cir. 2005)). The courts have repeatedly emphasized that the doctrine is
intended to protect legitimate judicial decision-making, not to provide a
shield for conduct that falls outside the bounds of judicial authority.
Application to Fraudulent or Coercive Acts
The proposition specifically raises the issue of fraudulent or coercive acts
taken without jurisdiction. The authorities make clear that judicial immunity
does not extend to such conduct. If a judge engages in fraudulent or
coercive acts that are nonjudicial or taken in the complete absence of
jurisdiction, immunity does not apply (Harper v. Merckle, 638 F.2d 848 (5th
Cir. 1981); Holloway v. Walker, 765 F.2d 517 (5th Cir. 1985)). This ensures
that judges are held accountable for egregious abuses of power and that the
doctrine of judicial immunity does not become a tool for shielding
misconduct.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the exceptions to judicial immunity are well established, courts have
cautioned that the determination of whether an act is judicial or taken in the
absence of jurisdiction can be fact-specific. The term "jurisdiction" is
construed broadly to protect judicial independence, and immunity is not lost
simply because a judge acts in error, with malice, or in excess of authority
(Holloway v. Walker, 765 F.2d 517 (5th Cir. 1985); Stump v. Sparkman, 435
U.S. 349 (1978)). Only when there is a clear absence of all jurisdiction does
immunity fail.
Additionally, while Malina v. Gonzales (994 F.2d 1121 (5th Cir. 1993)) was
reheard by the Fifth Circuit, the core principles regarding the exceptions to
judicial immunity remain consistent with Supreme Court precedent and are
reaffirmed in subsequent cases. The rehearing does not undermine the
authority of the general rule that immunity does not apply to nonjudicial
acts or acts taken in the complete absence of jurisdiction.
Conclusion
Judicial immunity is a foundational doctrine designed to protect the
independence of the judiciary by shielding judges from personal liability for
their judicial acts. However, this immunity is not absolute. Supreme Court
and Fifth Circuit precedent, as well as consistent district court decisions,
establish that immunity does not extend to nonjudicial acts or to actions
taken in the complete absence of jurisdiction. These exceptions are essential

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
to maintaining public confidence in the judiciary and ensuring that judges
are held accountable for egregious abuses of power. Allowing immunity for
fraudulent or coercive acts taken without jurisdiction would undermine the
very integrity the doctrine is meant to protect and is not supported by
precedent. The law thus strikes a careful balance: it protects judges when
acting within their lawful authority, but does not insulate them from liability
for conduct that falls outside the core functions of the judicial office.

Nat&#39;l Ass&#39;n for the Advancement of Colored People v. Reeves,
Civil Action 3:23-CV-272-HTW-LGI (S.D. Miss. Jun 01, 2023)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Mississippi
Extract
The Doctrine of Judicial Immunity was created to ameliorate these concerns,
with the aim of granting judges freedom to make independent judicial
decisions based on the law, without fear of prosecution or other external
factors... The Mireles holding states that '[t]here are only two circumstances
under which judicial immunity may be overcome. First, a judge is not
immune from liability for nonjudicial action, i.e., actions not taken in the
judge's judicial capacity. Second, a judge is not immune for actions, although
judicial in nature, taken in the complete absence of all jurisdiction'.
Summary
Purpose of judicial immunity, emphasizing that it is meant to protect judges
in their decision-making process, not to shield them from liability for actions
that are nonjudicial or taken without jurisdiction. The passage cites the
Mireles decision, which clearly outlines the exceptions to judicial immunity,
supporting the proposition that immunity does not cover nonjudicial acts or
acts taken in the absence of jurisdiction.
Malina v. Gonzales, 994 F.2d 1121 (5th Cir. 1993)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Absolute judicial immunity extends to all judicial acts that are not performed
in the clear absence of all jurisdiction. ... Thus, a judge has no immunity (1)
for actions taken outside of his judicial capacity, or (2) for actions that are
judicial in nature, but occur in the complete absence of all jurisdiction. ...
Furthermore, the factors that support immunity for judicial acts are not
implicated by Judge Gonzales's conduct. ... I would therefore hold that Judge
Gonzales is not judicially immune for the issuance of the contempt citation

and sentencing, because these 'actions ... [were] taken in the complete
absence of all jurisdiction.' Mireles, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 288.
Summary
The passage from "Malina v. Gonzales" clearly outlines the conditions under
which judicial immunity does not apply: actions taken outside of judicial
capacity or in the complete absence of jurisdiction. This aligns with the
proposition that judicial immunity is not meant to shield judges from liability
for nonjudicial or jurisdictionless conduct. The case specifically discusses
the lack of immunity for actions taken without jurisdiction, reinforcing the
idea that such immunity is not absolute and is intended to protect judicial
decision-making integrity.

U.S. District Court — Southern District of Mississippi
Extract
Such absolute immunity 'can be overcome only by showing that the actions
complained of were nonjudicial in nature or by showing that the actions
were taken in the complete absence of all jurisdiction.' Boyd, 31 F.3d at
284-85 (citing Mireles v. Waco, 502 U.S. 9, 11-12 (1991); Forrester, 484 U.S.
at 220-21). 'A judge's acts are judicial in nature if they are 'normally
performed by a judge and the parties affected dealt with the judge in his
judicial capacity.' Boyd, at 285 (quoting Mireles, 502 U.S. at 12; Stump v.
Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349, 362 (1978)).
Summary
Absolute judicial immunity can be overcome if the actions in question were
nonjudicial or taken in the complete absence of jurisdiction. This aligns with
the proposition that judicial immunity is not intended to shield judges from
liability for such conduct. The passage references key cases, including
Mireles v. Waco and Stump v. Sparkman, which are foundational to the
understanding of judicial immunity and its limitations. The context of the
passage within a federal district court decision further supports its
applicability to the proposition.

Extract
This immunity extends to Justices of the Peace as well as those who sit on
the Supreme Court, Turner v. Raynes, 611 F.2d 92 (5th Cir.) cert. denied,
449 U.S. 900, 101 S.Ct. 269, 66 L.Ed.2d 129 (1980), and shields judges
unless they act either in 'the clear absence of all jurisdiction over the subject
matter' or in a nonjudicial capacity. ... When, however, judicial officers act in
a 'nonjudicial' capacity, they are not immune from liability for that
conduct. ... The Stump Court distinguished between 'excess' and 'clear
absence' of jurisdiction by quoting the example given by the Bradley Court.
Thus, a criminal court judge who convicts a defendant of a nonexistent
crime acts in excess of jurisdiction and is absolutely immune. ... But a
probate judge who tries and convicts a defendant of a crime acts in the clear
absence of jurisdiction and enjoys no immunity.
Summary
The passage from "Brewer v. Blackwell" clearly outlines the conditions
under which judicial immunity does not apply, specifically when judges act in
a nonjudicial capacity or in the clear absence of jurisdiction. This aligns with
the proposition that judicial immunity is not meant to shield judges from
liability for egregious conduct that falls outside their judicial role. The
passage also references the distinction made in "Stump v. Sparkman"
between acts in excess of jurisdiction and those in the clear absence of
jurisdiction, further supporting the proposition.
Harper v. Merckle, 638 F.2d 848 (5th Cir. 1981)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Stump and McAlester, the guiding lights in our analysis, point in one
direction: Judge Merckle's actions on August 16, 1974 were not 'judicial
acts.' But we caution that our holding is exceedingly narrow and is tailored
to this, the rarest of factual settings. Succinctly stated, we hold only that
when it is beyond reasonable dispute that a judge has acted out of personal
motivation and has used his judicial office as an offensive weapon to
vindicate personal objectives, and it further appears certain that no party
has invoked the judicial machinery for any purpose at all, then the judge's
actions do not amount to 'judicial acts.' These nonjudicial acts, to state the
obvious, are not cloaked with judicial immunity from suit under § 1983.
Summary
The passage from Harper v. Merckle clearly delineates the boundaries of
judicial immunity, emphasizing that actions taken by a judge that are
motivated by personal objectives and not invoked by any party do not qualify
as "judicial acts." This aligns with the proposition that judicial immunity

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
does not extend to nonjudicial acts or acts taken in the absence of
jurisdiction. The case supports the idea that judicial immunity is not
intended to shield judges from liability for egregious conduct that falls
outside the scope of their judicial duties.
Calderon v. Bandera Cnty., CIVIL NO. SA-14-CA-881-XR (PMA) (W.D. Tex.
Dec 01, 2014)
U.S. District Court — Western District of Texas
Extract
Absolute judicial immunity is overcome in only two rather narrow sets of
circumstances: first, a judge is not immune from liability for non-judicial
actions, i.e., actions not taken in the judge's judicial capacity, and second, a
judge is not immune for actions, though judicial in nature, taken in complete
absence of all jurisdiction. Mireles v. Waco, 502 U.S. at 11-12; Davis v.
Tarrant County, Texas, 565 F.3d at 221; Ballard v. Wall, 413 F.3d at 515.
Summary
The passage explicitly states the two exceptions to absolute judicial
immunity: non-judicial actions and actions taken in the complete absence of
jurisdiction. This aligns with the proposition that judicial immunity is not
intended to shield judges from liability for egregious, nonjudicial, or
jurisdictionless conduct. The passage references the same cases (Mireles v.
Waco) that are part of the proposition, reinforcing the idea that judicial
immunity is not absolute and is subject to limitations to preserve judicial
integrity and protect litigants.
Foreman v. United States Marshal&#39;s Serv., Civil Action 23-0817 (E.D.
La. Jun 07, 2023)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Louisiana
Extract
It is well established that judges enjoy absolute judicial immunity from suits
for damages for all judicial acts except those undertaken with a 'clear
absence of all jurisdiction.'[] Federal courts have applied this to suits
brought under Bivens.[] An act is judicial for purposes of this analysis, based
on 'the nature of the act itself.'[]
Summary
Judicial immunity applies to judicial acts unless they are undertaken with a
"clear absence of all jurisdiction." This aligns with the proposition that
judicial immunity does not protect judges from liability for actions that are

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
nonjudicial or taken without jurisdiction. The passage also references the
nature of the act itself as a determinant of whether an act is judicial, which
supports the idea that immunity is not intended to shield judges from all
forms of liability, particularly for egregious conduct outside their
jurisdiction.
Hicks v. Bexar County, Tex., 973 F.Supp. 653 (W.D. Tex. 1997)
U.S. District Court — Western District of Texas
Extract
In Mireles v. Waco, the United States Supreme Court reiterated the
longstanding rule that absolute judicial immunity is overcome in only two
rather narrow sets of circumstances: first, a judge is not immune from
liability for nonjudicial actions, i.e., actions not taken in the judge's judicial
capacity, and second, a judge is not immune for actions, though judicial in
nature, taken in complete absence of all jurisdiction.
Summary
The passage explicitly references the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in
Mireles v. Waco, which outlines the exceptions to judicial immunity. These
exceptions are directly relevant to the proposition, as they highlight that
judicial immunity does not protect judges from liability for nonjudicial
actions or actions taken in the complete absence of jurisdiction. This
supports the proposition that judicial immunity is not intended to shield
judges from liability for egregious conduct that falls outside their judicial
capacity or jurisdiction.
Ballard v. Wall, 413 F.3d 510 (5th Cir. 2005)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Notwithstanding the aforementioned, judicial immunity can be overcome in
two sets of circumstances: (1) 'a judge is not immune from liability for
nonjudicial actions, i.e., actions not taken in the judge's judicial capacity';
and (2) 'a judge is not immune for actions, though judicial in nature, taken in
the complete absence of all jurisdiction.' Mireles, 502 U.S. at 11-12, 112
S.Ct. 286 (citations omitted).
Summary
The passage explicitly outlines the circumstances under which judicial
immunity does not apply: when actions are nonjudicial or taken in the
complete absence of jurisdiction. This aligns with the proposition that

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
judicial immunity is not meant to shield judges from liability for actions that
fall outside their judicial capacity or jurisdiction. The passage supports the
idea that judicial immunity is intended to protect legitimate judicial decision-
making while ensuring accountability for actions that do not meet these
criteria.
Holloway v. Walker, 765 F.2d 517 (5th Cir. 1985)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Judicial immunity does not extend to acts committed with a clear absence of
all jurisdiction. However, the term 'jurisdiction' is to be broadly construed to
effectuate the policies of guaranteeing a disinterested and independent
judicial decision-making process. Stump v. Sparkman, 98 S.Ct. at 1005.
Where a judge does not clearly lack all subject-matter jurisdiction, he does
not clearly lack all jurisdiction, and 'the same principle of exemption from
liability which obtains for errors committed in the ordinary prosecution of a
suit where there is jurisdiction of both subject and person, applies in cases
of this kind, and for the same reasons.' Bradley, 13 Wall. at 352.
Summary
Judicial immunity does not cover acts committed with a clear absence of all
jurisdiction, aligning with the proposition that immunity is not meant to
shield judges from liability for jurisdictionless conduct. The reference to
Stump v. Sparkman reinforces the idea that jurisdiction is broadly construed
to protect judicial independence, but not to the extent of covering acts
without any jurisdiction. This supports the proposition by highlighting the
boundaries of judicial immunity and the importance of maintaining judicial
integrity.

Summary
The passage clearly outlines the two exceptions to judicial immunity:
nonjudicial actions and actions taken in the absence of jurisdiction. This
directly supports the proposition that judicial immunity is not intended to
shield judges from liability for actions that fall outside their judicial capacity
or jurisdiction. The reference to Mireles v. Waco further strengthens this
point by providing a precedent that aligns with the proposition.

Summary
Judicial immunity can be overcome if the actions in question are nonjudicial
or taken in the complete absence of jurisdiction. This aligns with the
proposition that judicial immunity is not intended to shield judges from
liability for such conduct. The passage supports the idea that the integrity of
the judiciary is preserved by not extending immunity to actions that fall
outside the scope of judicial functions or jurisdiction.
Friston v. MDOC, CAUSE NO. 1:17-cv-329-HSO-JCG (S.D. Miss. Apr 02,
2019)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Mississippi
Extract
The law is well established that a judge enjoys absolute immunity from
damages when performing acts within his judicial capacity. See Stump v.
Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349, 356 (1978). 'Absolute immunity is immunity from
suit rather than simply a defense against liability, and is a threshold question
'to be resolved as early in the proceedings as possible.' Hulsey v. Owens, 63
F.3d 654, 356 (5th Cir. 1995) (quoting Boyd, 31 F.3d 279 at 284). Judicial
immunity can 'be overcome in two circumstances: (1) a judge is not immune
from liability for nonjudicial actions, i.e., actions not taken in the judge's
judicial capacity; and (2) a judge is not immune for actions, though judicial
in nature, taken in the complete absence of all jurisdiction.'
Summary
The passage explicitly states the conditions under which judicial immunity
can be overcome, aligning with the proposition that immunity does not

protect judges from liability for nonjudicial actions or actions taken without
jurisdiction. This supports the idea that judicial immunity is not intended to
shield judges from all forms of liability, particularly when their actions fall
outside their judicial capacity or jurisdiction.
Jones v. Wallace, Civil Action 22-1753 (E.D. La. Aug 08, 2022)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Louisiana
Extract
Absolute judicial immunity is overcome in only two narrow circumstances,
neither of which would apply here.[] First, a judge is not immune from
liability for non-judicial actions, i.e. actions outside of the judge's judicial
role.[] Second, a judge is not immune for actions, though judicial in nature,
taken in complete absence of all jurisdiction.[]
Summary
The passage clearly outlines the two exceptions to absolute judicial
immunity: non-judicial actions and actions taken in the complete absence of
jurisdiction. This directly supports the proposition by affirming that judicial
immunity does not protect judges from liability in these specific
circumstances, thereby preserving the integrity of the judiciary and
protecting litigants from potential abuse.
Campbell v. Booth, Civil Action 2:22-CV-00052 (S.D. Tex. Apr 15, 2022)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
There are only two circumstances under which judicial immunity can be
pierced: “(1) ‘a judge is not immune from liability for nonjudicial actions,
i.e., actions not taken in the judge's judicial capacity'; and (2) ‘a judge is not
immune from actions, though judicial in nature, taken in the complete
absence of all jurisdiction.'” Bowling v. Roach, 816 Fed.Appx. 901, 906 (5th
Cir. 2020), cert. denied, __ U.S.__, 141 S.Ct. 2466 (2021) (citing Mireles, 502
U.S. at 11-12).
Summary
The passage explicitly outlines the two exceptions to judicial immunity:
nonjudicial actions and actions taken in the complete absence of jurisdiction.
This directly supports the proposition that judicial immunity is not intended
to shield judges from liability for actions that fall outside their judicial
capacity or jurisdiction. The passage cites relevant case law, including
Mireles v. Waco, which is a key precedent in this area. This aligns with the

proposition's assertion that judicial immunity should not protect judges from
liability for egregious conduct that undermines the integrity of the judiciary.
Andrews v. Murphy, 1-23-CV-0950-RP (W.D. Tex. Nov 15, 2023)
U.S. District Court — Western District of Texas
Extract
Judicial immunity can be overcome in two sets of circumstances: (1) 'a judge
is not immune from liability for nonjudicial actions, i.e., actions not taken in
the judge's judicial capacity'; and (2) 'a judge is not immune for actions,
though judicial in nature, taken in the complete absence of all jurisdiction.'
Mireles, 502 U.S. at 1112 (citations omitted).
Summary
The passage explicitly states the two circumstances under which judicial
immunity can be overcome: nonjudicial actions and actions taken in the
complete absence of jurisdiction. This aligns directly with the proposition
that judicial immunity is not intended to shield judges from liability for
egregious, nonjudicial, or jurisdictionless conduct. The passage supports the
idea that judicial immunity is meant to protect judicial decision-making
within the bounds of jurisdiction and judicial capacity, not to provide blanket
protection for all actions by judges.
Mills v. Adams Cnty. Bd. of Supervisors, CIVIL ACTION NO. 5:18cv15-DCB-
MTP (S.D. Miss. Jun 25, 2018)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Mississippi
Extract
Judicial immunity can be overcome only by a showing that the actions
complained of were non-judicial in nature, or by showing that the actions
were taken in the absence of all jurisdiction. Mireles v. Waco, 502 U.S. 9, 11
(1991).
Summary
Judicial immunity can be overcome if the actions in question are non-judicial
or taken without jurisdiction. This aligns with the proposition that judicial
immunity is not intended to shield judges from liability for such conduct. The
reference to Mireles v. Waco further supports this understanding, as it is a
precedent that outlines the limitations of judicial immunity.

Gokey v. Economidy, SA-21-CV-00987-XR (W.D. Tex. Feb 08, 2022)
U.S. District Court — Western District of Texas
Extract
Absolute judicial immunity does not apply in certain limited circumstances.
Mireles, 502 U.S. at 11-12; Davis, 565 F.3d at 221. First, judges are not
immune from liability for non-judicial actions, i.e., actions not taken in the
judge's judicial capacity. Mireles, 502 U.S. at 11-12; Davis, 565 F.3d at 221.
Second, judges are not immune for actions, though judicial in nature, taken
in complete absence of all jurisdiction. Mireles, 502 U.S. at 11-12; Davis, 565
F.3d at 221.
Summary
Judicial immunity does not apply to non-judicial actions or actions taken in
the complete absence of jurisdiction. This aligns with the proposition that
judicial immunity is not intended to shield judges from liability for
egregious, nonjudicial, or jurisdictionless conduct. The passage references
the Mireles v. Waco decision, which is a key case supporting the proposition.
The context of the passage is a legal judgment, which adds authority to its
statements.
Ellsberry v. Stewart, Civil Action 1:21-cv-00385-BWR (S.D. Miss. Mar 06,
2023)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Mississippi
Extract
As a general matter, judicial immunity protects a judge from liability for acts
or omissions done in the exercise of his judicial function or capacity within
the limits of his jurisdiction... A judge will not be deprived of immunity
because the action he took was in error, was done maliciously, or was in
excess of his authority; rather, he will be subject to liability only when he has
acted in the clear absence of all jurisdiction... The doctrine of judicial
immunity can be overcome under two sets of circumstances: (i) nonjudicial
actions, which are actions not taken in the judge's judicial capacity and (ii)
actions taken in the complete absence of all jurisdiction, even though they
are judicial in nature.
Summary
The passage clearly outlines the conditions under which judicial immunity
can be overcome, specifically highlighting that immunity does not protect
judges when they act outside their judicial capacity or in the complete
absence of jurisdiction. This directly supports the proposition that judicial
immunity is not intended to shield judges from liability for nonjudicial or

jurisdictionless conduct. The passage references key cases such as Stump v.
Sparkman and Mireles v. Waco, which are central to the proposition.
Judicial Immunity
Encyclopedia of the American Constitution - GALE - Theodore
Eisenberg - 2000-01-01
Extract
In Randall v. Brigham (1869) the Supreme Court endorsed the principle of
judicial immunity. Under doctrine 'as old as the law,' Justice Stephen J. Field
wrote for the Court, judges of courts of general jurisdiction are immune
from suit for judicial acts 'unless perhaps where the acts, in excess of
jurisdiction, are done maliciously or corruptly.' In Bradley v. Fisher (1872)
Justice Field, again writing for the Court, extended Randall's standard for
protecting judges to preclude liability for all judicial acts except 'acts where
no jurisdiction whatever' existed and illustrated the difference between acts
'in excess of jurisdiction' and acts clearly without jurisdiction. A probate
judge acts clearly without jurisdiction when he tries a criminal case.
Summary
Historical development of judicial immunity, highlighting key Supreme Court
cases that establish the limits of this doctrine. It specifically notes that
judicial immunity does not protect judges when they act "clearly without
jurisdiction," such as when a probate judge tries a criminal case. This
supports the proposition that judicial immunity is not intended to shield
judges from liability for acts taken in the complete absence of jurisdiction,
thereby preserving the integrity of the judiciary and protecting litigants
from abuse.
Judicial Immunity
West's Encyclopedia of American Law - GALE - Jeffrey Lehman,
Shirelle Phelps - 2005-01-01
Extract
Judicial immunity protects judges from liability for monetary damages in
civil court, for acts they perform pursuant to their judicial function. A judge
generally has immunity from civil damages if he or she had jurisdiction over
the subject matter in issue. This means that a judge has immunity for acts
relating to cases before the court, but not for acts relating to cases beyond
the court's reach. For example, a criminal court judge would not have
immunity if he or she tried to influence proceedings in a juvenile court.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The passage explains that judicial immunity is applicable only when judges
act within their jurisdiction and perform judicial functions. It explicitly
states that judges do not have immunity for acts beyond the court's reach,
which aligns with the proposition that immunity does not cover nonjudicial
acts or acts taken without jurisdiction. This supports the idea that judicial
immunity is not meant to shield judges from liability for egregious conduct
outside their jurisdiction.
Vol. 18 No. 9 Pg. 1747 When the Defendant Is the Judge
Colorado Lawyer - Colorado Bar Association - 1989-00-00
Extract
Thus, there are two requirements for absolute judicial immunity. The first is
that the act at issue must be a 'judicial' act. The second is that the judge
must not be acting in the clear absence of all jurisdiction... Jurisdiction has
long been a prerequisite for judicial immunity. The jurisdictional
requirement for immunity is only that there not be a 'clear absence of all
jurisdiction.' Actions which are merely 'in excess of jurisdiction' are
nonetheless immune... Where immunity is found not to be present due to
lack of jurisdiction, it usually is because the action contravened either a
statute or a specific limitation of which the judge had knowledge.
Summary
Two key requirements for judicial immunity: the act must be judicial, and
the judge must not act in the clear absence of jurisdiction. It emphasizes
that actions taken without jurisdiction do not qualify for immunity, aligning
with the proposition that judicial immunity does not protect nonjudicial or
jurisdictionless conduct. This supports the idea that immunity is not meant
to shield judges from liability for egregious actions outside their jurisdiction.

(1978).
Summary
The passage directly addresses the limitations of judicial immunity,
specifically noting that it does not apply to nonjudicial actions or actions
taken in the absence of jurisdiction. This aligns with the proposition that
judicial immunity is not intended to shield judges from liability for such
conduct, thereby supporting the integrity of the judiciary and protecting
litigants from abuse.
Vol. 65 No. 06 Pg. 30 Immunity Under Section 1983
KBA Bar Journal - Kansas Bar Association - 1996-00-00
Extract
Judicial immunity is overcome in only two sets of circumstances. First, a
judge is not immune from liability for nonjudicial acts. [FN37] ... The second
situation in which judicial immunity is overcome occurs when a judge's acts,
though judicial in nature, are taken 'in the complete absence of all
jurisdiction.' [FN43] ... This limitation is to be contrasted with situations in
which a judge acts 'in excess of his jurisdiction.' In this latter situation, the
judge retains absolute immunity even if his acts were motivated by malice
and corruption. Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349, 356.
Summary
The passage clearly outlines the two exceptions to judicial immunity:
nonjudicial acts and acts taken in the complete absence of jurisdiction. This
directly supports the proposition that judicial immunity is not intended to
shield judges from liability for egregious, nonjudicial, or jurisdictionless
conduct. The reference to Stump v. Sparkman further reinforces the idea
that acts taken without jurisdiction do not enjoy immunity, aligning with the
proposition's assertion about preserving the integrity of the judiciary.

The passage explains that judicial immunity does not apply to acts taken in
the clear absence of jurisdiction, aligning with the proposition that immunity
is not meant to shield judges from liability for nonjudicial or jurisdictionless
conduct. It also emphasizes that only judicial acts are protected, supporting
the idea that immunity is intended to protect legitimate judicial decision-
making rather than egregious conduct. The context of the passage, being
part of a broader discussion on individual immunity defenses under Section
1983, indicates its relevance to the proposition.
