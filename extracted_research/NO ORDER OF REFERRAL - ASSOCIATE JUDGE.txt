Question
A district judge holds a hearing on a protective order and orders a father to
vacate without any evidence being presented and without an evidentiary
hearing. he resets the case to a later date to be heard by his associate judge.
No order of referral is ever filed and signed, and there exists no general
order of referral or standing orders regarding associate judges. Are all
actions taken by this judge void?
Answer (Texas)
Short response
Not all actions taken by the district judge are automatically void under these
circumstances; however, the referral of the case to the associate judge
without a signed order of referral or standing order is procedurally
improper, and any actions taken by the associate judge in the absence of
such referral would be unauthorized and potentially void. The district
judge’s own interim order—issued without evidence or an evidentiary
hearing—may be subject to challenge as improper, but is not necessarily
void for lack of jurisdiction.
Summary
Texas law requires that a district judge issue either an individual or general
order of referral before an associate judge may hear a case; without such an
order, the associate judge lacks authority to act, and any actions taken by
the associate judge are generally considered void or, at minimum, without
legal effect until properly adopted by the referring court. However, the
district judge’s own actions—such as issuing a temporary order to vacate
without an evidentiary hearing—are not automatically void, though they may
be reversible or subject to challenge for procedural impropriety.
The absence of a referral order does not retroactively void the district
judge’s own orders, but it does render any subsequent proceedings before
the associate judge unauthorized. Texas courts have consistently held that
strict compliance with referral requirements is necessary for associate
judges to exercise authority, and failure to comply with these requirements
can render their actions void, but not necessarily those of the referring
district judge.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
The Texas Family Code, specifically section 201.006, governs the referral of
cases to associate judges. This provision mandates that a district judge must

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
render either an individual order of referral for a specific case or a general
order of referral specifying the types of cases that may be heard by an
associate judge. The statute is clear that such an order is a procedural
prerequisite for an associate judge to exercise authority over a matter. The
statute does not, however, address the validity of interim actions taken by
the district judge prior to referral, nor does it declare such actions void if
the referral process is not followed (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006).
Case Law
Texas appellate courts have repeatedly addressed the consequences of
failing to comply with statutory referral requirements. In Szanyi v. Gibson,
NO. 01-15-00895-CV (Tex. App. Jun 14, 2016), the court explained that a
judge may refer a case to an associate judge only if an individual or general
order of referral is issued, as required by section 201.006. The court also
noted that orders signed by a judge sitting for the referring court are valid,
and that objections to an associate judge’s authority must be timely.
Omura v. State, 730 S.W.2d 766 (Tex. App. 1987) further clarifies that
magistrates (and by analogy, associate judges) are agents of the district
judge and cannot issue binding orders unless their actions are properly
referred and subsequently adopted by the district judge. The court in Omura
held that actions taken by a magistrate without proper referral and adoption
are not legally binding and may be void, emphasizing the constitutional
requirement that only judges vested with judicial authority may make final
determinations.
Similarly, in Ex parte Stacey, 709 S.W.2d 185 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986), the
court held that proceedings before a magistrate without a proper order of
referral are improper and must be remanded. The court criticized the use of
blanket or general orders that do not specify the duties of the magistrate,
underscoring the necessity of a valid referral order for the magistrate’s
actions to be authorized.
Supplementary cases, such as Mathis v. Graves, NO. 01-18-00789-CV (Tex.
App. Oct 31, 2019) and In re Marriage of D.E.L., NO. 14-17-00216-CV (Tex.
App. Feb 12, 2019), reinforce the principle that associate judges’ authority is
strictly limited to the scope of the referral, and that actions taken outside
this authority are not final or binding unless and until adopted by the
referring court.
Analysis
The District Judge’s Actions
The district judge in this scenario held a hearing on a protective order and
ordered the father to vacate without any evidence being presented and
without an evidentiary hearing. While this raises significant due process
concerns and may be reversible error, the judge’s authority to issue such an
order is not dependent on the referral process. The district judge, as the
presiding judge of the court, retains jurisdiction over the case and may issue

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
temporary orders, even if those orders are procedurally flawed or issued
without proper evidentiary support.
Texas law distinguishes between void and voidable orders. An order is void
only if the court lacked jurisdiction or authority to issue it; otherwise,
procedural errors render the order voidable, meaning it is valid unless and
until set aside on appeal or by other appropriate means. There is no
indication in the provided authorities that a district judge’s temporary order,
even if issued without evidence or a hearing, is void for lack of jurisdiction.
Rather, such an order would be subject to challenge and possible reversal,
but not automatically void (Szanyi v. Gibson, NO. 01-15-00895-CV (Tex. App.
Jun 14, 2016)).
Referral to the Associate Judge
The critical issue arises with the referral of the case to the associate judge.
Section 201.006 of the Texas Family Code requires a written order of
referral—either individual or general—before an associate judge may hear a
case. In the absence of such an order, the associate judge lacks authority to
act. The courts in Omura v. State, 730 S.W.2d 766 (Tex. App. 1987) and Ex
parte Stacey, 709 S.W.2d 185 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986) make clear that actions
taken by a magistrate or associate judge without proper referral are not
legally binding and may be void.
The rationale is that associate judges are not Article V judges and derive
their authority solely from the referring court’s order. Without a valid
referral, any actions taken by the associate judge are unauthorized. The
courts have characterized such actions as void, not merely voidable, because
the associate judge lacks any jurisdiction over the matter absent a proper
referral (Omura v. State, 730 S.W.2d 766 (Tex. App. 1987); Ex parte Stacey,
709 S.W.2d 185 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986)).
Supplementary authority in Mathis v. Graves, NO. 01-18-00789-CV (Tex.
App. Oct 31, 2019) suggests that, in some circumstances, actions taken by
an associate judge without authority may be treated as recommendations
rather than void judgments, and only become effective if and when adopted
by the referring court. However, this does not cure the lack of authority to
act in the first instance, and the absence of a referral order remains a
fundamental defect.
No General or Standing Order
The facts specify that there is no general order of referral or standing order
regarding associate judges. This further confirms that the associate judge
had no authority to act in the case. Section 201.006 allows for either an
individual or general order, but in the absence of both, the statutory
prerequisite for referral is unmet. The courts have consistently required
strict compliance with these requirements, and failure to do so renders the
associate judge’s actions void (Ex parte Stacey, 709 S.W.2d 185 (Tex. Crim.
App. 1986)).

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Adoption by the District Judge
The authorities also make clear that, even if an associate judge acts without
authority, the referring district judge may later adopt or sign the associate
judge’s recommendations, thereby curing the defect and rendering the
order effective from the date of adoption (Mathis v. Graves, NO.
01-18-00789-CV (Tex. App. Oct 31, 2019)). However, in the absence of such
adoption, the associate judge’s actions remain unauthorized and void.
Voidness versus Voidability
It is important to distinguish between actions that are void and those that
are voidable. Actions taken by an associate judge without a valid referral are
generally considered void because the associate judge lacks jurisdiction. In
contrast, actions taken by the district judge, even if procedurally improper,
are not void unless the judge lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, which is not
the case here. Procedural errors by the district judge render the order
voidable, not void (Szanyi v. Gibson, NO. 01-15-00895-CV (Tex. App. Jun 14,
2016)).
Exceptions and Caveats
There may be circumstances in which a party waives objections to the
associate judge’s authority by failing to timely object, as discussed in Szanyi
v. Gibson, NO. 01-15-00895-CV (Tex. App. Jun 14, 2016). However, the facts
here indicate that no referral order was ever issued, and there is no
indication of waiver. Additionally, if the district judge later adopts the
associate judge’s recommendations, the defect may be cured, but absent
such adoption, the associate judge’s actions remain void.
It is also possible that a reviewing court could treat unauthorized actions by
an associate judge as recommendations rather than void judgments, as in 
Mathis v. Graves, NO. 01-18-00789-CV (Tex. App. Oct 31, 2019), but this
does not change the fundamental requirement for a valid referral.
Conclusion
In summary, the district judge’s own actions—though potentially reversible
for lack of evidence or an evidentiary hearing—are not void for lack of
jurisdiction. However, the referral of the case to the associate judge without
a signed order of referral or standing order is a fundamental procedural
defect. Any actions taken by the associate judge in the absence of such
referral are unauthorized and void, unless and until adopted by the referring
district judge. Texas law requires strict compliance with referral
requirements, and failure to do so deprives the associate judge of authority
to act. The district judge’s interim orders remain valid unless set aside on
appeal or by other appropriate means, but the associate judge’s actions are
void ab initio in the absence of a valid referral.

Mathis v. Graves, NO. 01-18-00789-CV (Tex. App. Oct 31, 2019)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
But our conclusion that Associate Judge Sydow lacked authority to render a
final order does not mean that the April 1, 2016 order is void... the Family
Code grants an associate judge authority to, among other things,
'recommend an order to be rendered in a case.' See TEX. FAM. CODE §
201.007(a)(10). Accordingly, we construe the April 1, 2016 order as a
recommended order because that is all the associate judge had authority to
sign... The associate judge’s order did not become the final order of the
referring court until it was signed by the referring district court judge,
which did not happen until June 25, 2018. See id. § 201.013(b).
Summary
The case holds that where an associate judge lacks authority to render a
final order (e.g., absent proper consent or referral), actions taken may be
treated as recommendations rather than void judgments, and become
effective only when adopted/signed by the referring district judge per Tex.
Fam. Code §§ 201.013–.014. Thus, lack of authority does not automatically
void all actions; characterization and subsequent adoption control.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A judge can refer a case to an associate judge if the 'judge of the referring
court' issues 'an individual order of referral.' TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. §
201.006(a)... The judge can refer 'any aspect of the suit over which the court
has jurisdiction' to the associate judge absent a timely objection. Id. §
201.005(a) ... Judge Ewing, as a county court judge in the same county as
the 306th District Court, could 'sign a judgment or order in any of the courts
regardless of whether the case is transferred' and that order 'is valid and
binding as if the case were pending in the court of the judge who acts in the
matter.' TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. § 74.094 ... Thus, Judge Ewing properly
signed the 'individual order of referral' referring the case to Judge Baker." ...
"'A party must file an objection to an associate judge hearing a trial on the
merits ... not later than the 10th day after the date the party receives notice
that the associate judge will hear the trial.' TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. §
201.005 ... Thus, because it was not timely filed, the trial court properly
denied his objection.

Summary
The case explains that: (1) referral to an associate judge ordinarily requires
an individual order of referral by the judge of the referring court under Fam.
Code § 201.006(a); (2) another judge sitting for the referring court may
validly sign such orders under Gov’t Code § 74.094; and (3) objections to an
associate judge must be timely under § 201.005. It does not hold that actions
are void absent referral in all circumstances; rather, it shows how referral
defects can be cured or how objections can be waived. It also affirms that
orders signed by a judge sitting for the court are valid.

See Tex. Fam. Code § 201.005(a) (a judge of a court may refer to an
associate judge a suit involving the marriage relationship or protection of
the family over which the court has jurisdiction, including any matter
ancillary to the suit); § 201.006(a) (judge of the referring court shall render
an individual order of referral or a general order of referral specifying the
class and types of cases to be heard by the associate judge)." ... "Husband
argues that the associate judge who ruled on Wife's motion to reconsider
lacked authority to do so, and the resulting order granting reconsideration is
thus void." ... "Judge David Sydow, an associate judge, held the resumed
hearing and signed the order granting Wife's motion to reconsider. Judge
Lombardino then signed the final decree of divorce, which incorporated the
relief granted in the order on Wife's motion to reconsider. On appeal,
Husband argues that because there is no written order assigning the case to
an associate judge, Judge Sydow was not authorized to rule on the motion to
reconsider.
Summary
The passage confirms that Texas Family Code requires an individual or
general order of referral specifying cases an associate judge may hear. It
also shows litigants have argued that orders by an associate judge without a
written referral are void. It does not, however, decide whether all actions
are void; nor does it address whether a district judge’s temporary orders
without evidence are void. It indicates the legal standard for referral and
sets up the voidness argument but does not resolve the precise outcome in
this case or in protective-order contexts.

Extract
There was no hearing before the district judge. Since there is no order of
referral of the case by the district judge to a duly appointed magistrate as
required under Article 1918c, § 4(c), supra, this cause must be remanded to
the trial court." ... "‘(c) To refer a case to a magistrate, the judge shall issue
an order of referral specifying the duties of the magistrate.’" ... "In my
opinion it is clear that the Legislature never intended that one general all
encompassing order of referral would suffice to refer all cases in district
court, past or present, without designation as to style or number, to some
unnamed magistrate, with authority to act in all permissible statutory
proceedings, whether applicable or not.
Summary
The case holds that when a matter is handled by a magistrate/associate
judge without a proper order of referral from the district judge as required
by statute, the proceedings are improper and must be remanded. It also
criticizes reliance on blanket/general orders and underscores that an order
of referral must exist and specify duties. This supports the proposition that
actions by an associate judge taken without a valid referral are
unauthorized. The passage does not directly address family-law protective
orders or whether the district judge’s own initial actions (e.g., issuing a
vacate order without evidence) are void versus voidable, but it is directly
relevant to the validity of actions by an associate judge absent a referral.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
To refer 'one or more cases to a magistrate, a judge must issue an order of
referral specifying the magistrate's duties.' Id. § 54.657(a). A criminal law
magistrate is not a district court judge and possesses no standing
jurisdiction to hear cases but instead must obtain jurisdiction by virtue of a
referral order from the district court. Id. § 54.657. ... The record
affirmatively shows that the order of referral to the magistrate was not
signed until March 26, 1992, two days after Davis's plea hearing. ... [W]e
find persuasive Davis's argument that a referral order signed after the
magistrate has acted is not effective to confer retroactive jurisdiction. ...

42 (1987) (general order of referral to the magistrate was valid when
'entered prior to the referral of Kelly's case').
Summary
The case holds that magistrates (not district judges) lack inherent
jurisdiction and must have a written referral order specifying duties; a

=== PAGE 8 ===

referral signed after the magistrate acts does not retroactively confer
jurisdiction. It also recognizes general referral orders are permissible if
entered before the case is referred. While the case is criminal and specific to
Tarrant County magistrates, the principle that a subordinate judicial
officer’s authority depends on a valid, prior referral order is applicable by
analogy to Texas associate judges in civil/family matters, suggesting actions
by an associate judge without any referral order (and no standing/general
order) are unauthorized.
Omura v. State, 730 S.W.2d 766 (Tex. App. 1987)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
No act of the magistrate is legally binding unless and until the magistrate's
actions are adopted by the referring court. ... Magistrates are not judges,
but are merely agents of judges appointed to assist the district judges of
Dallas County in certain limited matters. ... It is clear from the wording of
the act that it is mandatory that the district judge review the actions taken
by the magistrate. ... Only after a careful review of the record and any
exhibits is the district judge in a position to 'modify, correct, reject, reverse,
or recommit for further information any action taken by the magistrate.' ... I
would hold that, as applied to appellant, section 54.312(b) of the Dallas
Magistrates Act violates article V, section 1 of the Texas Constitution,
because it grants the power to make final judicial determinations to one not
constitutionally vested with judicial authority. I would hold, therefore, that
an order entered pursuant to section 54.312(b) is void, that the judgment
entered under this section should be reversed, and the cause remanded to
the trial court for a new hearing.
Summary
The case establishes that magistrates/associate judges are agents who
cannot issue binding orders absent proper referral and subsequent review/
adoption by the district judge. Actions taken without proper referral or
without the district judge’s meaningful review/adoption are not legally
binding and may be void. The opinion characterizes orders entered under a
mechanism that allows final determinations by a magistrate without proper
judicial oversight as void. While Omura involves Dallas criminal magistrates
and a specific statute, the core principle—no final judicial power in a non-
Article V judge absent strict compliance with referral and adoption
requirements—supports an argument that actions by an associate judge
without an order of referral or standing authority, and without district court
adoption after review, are void.

Extract
In referring a case to an associate judge, the judge of the referring court
shall render: an individual order of referral; or a general order of referral
specifying the class and type of cases to be heard by the associate judge.
The order of referral may limit the power or duties of an associate judge.
Summary
Section 201.006 requires that when a matter is referred to an associate
judge, the referring judge must render either an individual order of referral
or a general order of referral defining the types of cases the associate judge
may hear. The statute speaks to the procedural prerequisite for an associate
judge to hear a case. It does not address whether interim actions by the
district judge (e.g., issuing temporary orders without evidence) are void. It
does indicate that absent an individual or general order of referral, sending
the case to an associate judge would be improper procedurally, which may
affect the validity of actions taken by the associate judge. The statute is
silent on voidness versus voidability and does not itself declare actions void.
