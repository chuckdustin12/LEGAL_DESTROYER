Question
What are the legal standards for RICO civil claims in the 10th Circuit,
including the requirements for open-ended versus closed-ended continuity?
Answer (Tenth Circuit)
Short response
To establish a civil RICO claim in the 10th Circuit, a plaintiff must prove: (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity, with the pattern element requiring both relationship and continuity
among predicate acts. Continuity can be either "closed-ended" (involving a
closed period of repeated conduct over a substantial timeframe) or "open-
ended" (involving past conduct that threatens future repetition).
Summary
Civil RICO claims in the 10th Circuit require proving four essential
elements: conduct, enterprise, pattern of racketeering activity, and resultant
injury. The pattern element is particularly critical and demands showing
both "relationship" among the predicate acts (similar purposes, results,
participants, victims, or methods of commission) and "continuity" (either
closed-ended or open-ended). While the relationship requirement is
relatively straightforward, the continuity requirement presents greater
challenges for plaintiffs.
The 10th Circuit recognizes two forms of continuity. Closed-ended continuity
requires proving a series of related predicates extending over a substantial
period of time, with acts spanning only weeks or months being insufficient.
Open-ended continuity requires showing that past conduct projects into the
future with a threat of repetition, which can be demonstrated by showing
that: the predicates themselves involve a threat of long-term racketeering
activity; they form the operations of an association existing for criminal
purposes; or they constitute the regular way of conducting either a
legitimate or illegitimate business. The court applies a case-specific analysis
to determine whether either form of continuity exists.
Background on Civil RICO Claims
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provides a
civil cause of action for treble damages to anyone injured "by reason of"
certain racketeering activity under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1964(c) and 1962. Originally
designed to combat organized crime's infiltration of legitimate businesses,
RICO has evolved into a powerful tool in civil litigation, allowing plaintiffs to
recover enhanced damages when they can demonstrate a pattern of criminal
conduct.

Core Elements of a Civil RICO Claim
In the 10th Circuit, establishing a valid RICO claim requires a plaintiff to
plausibly allege four essential elements. As articulated in Johnson v. Heath,
56 F.4th 851, 858 (10th Cir. 2022), a plaintiff must show that a defendant
"(1) conducted the affairs (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of
racketeering activity."
These four elements derive from the statutory language of 18 U.S.C. §
1962(c), as confirmed by the 10th Circuit in Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244,
1261-62 (10th Cir. 2006), which states: "The elements of a civil RICO claim
are (1) investment in, control of, or conduct of (2) an enterprise (3) through
a pattern (4) of racketeering activity."
For the conduct element, the 10th Circuit applies the Supreme Court's
"operation or management" test, as noted in Bancoklahoma Mortgage Corp.
v. Capital Title Co., 194 F.3d 1089 (10th Cir. 1999): "For liability to be
imposed under that test, the defendants must have participated in the
operation or management of the RICO enterprise."
The enterprise requirement involves showing a structured group of
individuals associated for a common purpose, while racketeering activity
refers to specific predicate acts listed in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), including mail
fraud, wire fraud, and various other federal and state crimes.
The Pattern Requirement: Relationship and
Continuity
The focus of this analysis is on the pattern requirement, particularly the
continuity aspect that distinguishes ordinary criminal conduct from the type
of ongoing criminal activity that RICO was designed to address.
Defining a "Pattern" of Racketeering Activity
The statutory definition in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5) states that a "'pattern of
racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering activity."
However, as noted in Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d 751, 761 (10th Cir. 2010),
proving two predicate acts is necessary but not sufficient to establish a
pattern. The 10th Circuit has consistently held that plaintiffs must also
demonstrate that "the predicates themselves amount to, or that they
otherwise constitute a threat of, continuing racketeering activity."
This requirement stems from RICO's legislative history, which indicates that
the law was aimed at "long-term criminal activity" rather than "sporadic
activity" or the "isolated offender." As the 10th Circuit explained in Condict
v. Condict, 815 F.2d 579 (10th Cir. 1987), "As many commentators have
pointed out, the definition of a 'pattern of racketeering activity' differs from
the other provisions in Sec. 1961 in that it states that a pattern 'requires at
least two acts of racketeering activity,' Sec. 1961(5) (emphasis added), not
that it 'means' two such acts. The implication is that while two acts are
necessary, they may not be sufficient."

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
It should be noted that Condict v. Condict, 815 F.2d 579 (10th Cir. 1987) was
stated as superseded by Maxwell v. Wilson, 766 P.2d 909, 108 N.M. 65, 1988
NMSC 96 (N.M. 1988). However, this subsequent treatment appears to be
on other grounds, as the standard for establishing a pattern of racketeering
activity articulated in Condict continues to be cited in more recent 10th
Circuit RICO cases.
The "Continuity Plus Relationship" Test
Following the Supreme Court's guidance, the 10th Circuit employs what is
known as the "continuity plus relationship" test to determine whether a
pattern exists. As articulated in Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d 751, 761 (10th Cir.
2010), "A viable RICO claim requires a showing of 'continuity plus
relationship.'"
The Relationship Component
The relationship component is relatively straightforward. According to 
Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d 751, 761 (10th Cir. 2010), "The relationship test is
not a cumbersome one for a RICO plaintiff. A showing that predicate acts
have the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods
of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing
characteristics and are not isolated events is essentially all that is needed."
In practice, when predicate acts are part of a common fraudulent scheme,
they generally satisfy the relationship requirement, as noted in Condict v.
Condict, 826 F.2d 923 (10th Cir. 1987): "It is clear that when, as here, the
acts are part of a common fraudulent scheme, they satisfy the relationship
requirement of Sedima."
The Continuity Component
The continuity requirement presents a more significant hurdle for RICO
plaintiffs. As Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d 751, 761 (10th Cir. 2010) observed,
"The showing required for 'continuity,' on the other hand, 'is more difficult to
meet.'"
The 10th Circuit, following Supreme Court precedent, recognizes that
"'Continuity' is both a closed- and open-ended concept, referring either to a
closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature
projects into the future with a threat of repetition." This dual approach
provides two distinct pathways for establishing continuity.
Closed-Ended Continuity in the 10th Circuit
Closed-ended continuity refers to a completed period of repeated criminal
conduct. According to Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851, 859-60 (10th Cir.
2022), this can be established by alleging a "closed period of repeated
racketeering conduct."

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Temporal Dimension: Substantial Period Requirement
A critical aspect of closed-ended continuity is its temporal dimension. As
explained in Sil-Flo, Inc. v. SFHC, Inc., 917 F.2d 1507 (10th Cir. 1990),
closed-ended continuity requires "a series of related predicates extending
over a substantial period of time. Predicate acts extending over a few weeks
or months are insufficient."
The 10th Circuit has not established a bright-line rule for what constitutes a
"substantial period of time," leaving this determination to case-specific
analysis. However, the court has indicated that activities spanning only
weeks or months would generally be insufficient, while schemes extending
over years are more likely to meet this requirement.
In Levey v. Wetherall, Civil Action No. 1:19-cv-02294-DDD-MEH (D. Colo.
Sep 29, 2020), the court reiterated that the predicate acts at issue must
"extend over a substantial period of time; a few weeks or months is
considered insubstantial."
Beyond Duration: The Extensiveness Factor
Duration alone is not determinative of closed-ended continuity. In Skurkey v.
Daniel, the court explained that in evaluating closed-ended continuity, it
considers "the number of victims, the number of racketeering acts, the
variety of racketeering acts, whether the injuries were distinct, the
complexity and size of the scheme, and the nature or character of the
enterprise."
This multi-factor approach reflects the 10th Circuit's concern with
identifying patterns of criminal activity that represent the type of sustained,
organized criminal behavior that RICO was designed to address, rather than
isolated or limited criminal schemes.
Single Scheme Limitation
The 10th Circuit has expressed skepticism about finding closed-ended
continuity when the alleged pattern involves a single scheme directed at a
single victim to accomplish a discrete goal. In Nation v. Shah, 4:19-cv-00588-
JDR-JFJ (N.D. Okla. Oct 30, 2024), the court noted that establishing
continuity is "more problematic" and "more difficult to meet" than the
relationship requirement.
Similarly, in Thompson v. Wyoming Alaska, Inc., 652 F.Supp. 1222 (D. Utah
1987), the court, referencing 10th Circuit precedent, observed that a
scheme involving "one victim," "one time," and "one discrete goal" would
constitute an "isolated incident" that fails to satisfy the continuity
requirement.

Open-Ended Continuity in the 10th Circuit
Open-ended continuity provides an alternative avenue for establishing a
pattern when the alleged criminal activity, though perhaps of shorter
duration, demonstrates a clear threat of continuing into the future.
Threat of Future Criminal Activity
The essence of open-ended continuity is the threat of future criminal
conduct related to past criminal activity. As stated in Phelps v. Wichita
Eagle-Beacon, 886 F.2d 1262, 1273 (10th Cir. 1989), "Open-ended continuity
requires a clear threat of future criminal conduct related to past criminal
conduct."
This future-oriented focus allows RICO liability to attach even when the
pattern has not yet extended over a substantial period, provided there is a
demonstrable risk that the criminal activity will continue.
Three Paths to Establishing Open-Ended Continuity
The 10th Circuit has recognized several ways to establish open-ended
continuity. According to Nation v. Shah, 4:19-cv-00588-JDR-JFJ (N.D. Okla.
Oct 30, 2024), open-ended continuity can be established when racketeering
acts:
"Involved implicit or explicit threats of repetition";
"Formed the operations of an association that exists for criminal
purposes"; or
Were "part of the defendants' regular way of conducting a legitimate
enterprise."
Similarly, Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir.
1993) explained that open-ended continuity "may be established by showing
that the predicates themselves involve a distinct threat of long-term
racketeering activity, either implicit or explicit, or that the predicates are a
regular way of conducting the defendant's ongoing legitimate business or
the RICO enterprise."
Case-Specific Analysis
The 10th Circuit emphasizes that determining open-ended continuity
requires a fact-intensive, case-specific analysis. As Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.
4th 851 (10th Cir. 2022) noted, "No universal standard precisely defining
continuity exists because it ultimately 'depends on the specific facts of each
case.'"
This flexible approach allows courts to assess whether the particular
circumstances of a case indicate a genuine threat of continued criminal
activity or merely represent isolated or sporadic criminal behavior.

Contrasting Open-Ended and Closed-Ended
Continuity
The distinction between closed-ended and open-ended continuity is primarily
temporal. Closed-ended continuity looks backward at completed conduct,
while open-ended continuity looks forward to potential future conduct.
Temporal Focus
As explained in Schrag v. Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543 (D. Kan. 1992), closed-
ended continuity involves "a closed period of repeated conduct," while open-
ended continuity concerns "past conduct that by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition."
The court further clarified that a RICO plaintiff "may demonstrate continuity
over a closed period by proving a series of related predicates extending over
a substantial period of time." In contrast, "Predicates extending over merely
a few weeks or months, on the other hand, may satisfy the continuity
element if there is a threat of repetition in the future."
Different Evidentiary Requirements
The evidence required to establish each type of continuity differs
significantly. For closed-ended continuity, the focus is on the duration and
extensiveness of past criminal activity. For open-ended continuity, the focus
shifts to indicators suggesting that the criminal activity will continue into
the future.
As summarized in "RICO: A Primer" (2022-01-31), closed-ended continuity
requires "[p]roving 'a series of related predicate acts extending over a
substantial period of time,'" while open-ended continuity requires "[a] threat
of 'continuing criminal activity extending indefinitely into the future,' in light
of the nature of the enterprise and predicate acts alleged."
Complementary Approaches
These two forms of continuity are not mutually exclusive but rather
complementary approaches designed to capture different types of ongoing
criminal activity. As the 10th Circuit recognized in Edwards v. First Nat.
Bank, Bartlesville, Oklahoma, 872 F.2d 347 (10th Cir. 1989), some criminal
schemes may have discrete objectives that, once accomplished, bring the
scheme to an end, while others involve "open-ended fraudulent activity"
without "a single goal that, when achieved, will bring the activity to an end."
The dual approach to continuity allows courts to apply RICO in both
contexts, provided the criminal activity rises to the level of a genuine
pattern rather than isolated or sporadic criminal acts.

Special Considerations in the 10th Circuit
The 10th Circuit's approach to RICO continuity includes several nuanced
considerations that distinguish its jurisprudence.
Multi-Factor Analysis
While the 10th Circuit applies the Supreme Court's "continuity plus
relationship" test, it also continues to use a multi-factor approach developed
before the Supreme Court's definitive interpretation in H.J. Inc. As noted in
secondary materials on RICO from 2005-03-22, "The Seventh and Tenth
Circuits employ the H.J. Inc. test and consider duration and open-endedness
of the racketeering activity, but cling to the multi-factor test applied prior to
H.J. Inc."
This multi-factor approach considers not just temporal aspects but also the
number of victims, variety of predicate acts, distinctness of injuries, and
complexity of the scheme, providing a more holistic assessment of whether
the alleged conduct constitutes a pattern.
Single Scheme Considerations
The 10th Circuit has repeatedly addressed the question of whether a single
fraudulent scheme can constitute a pattern. In Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick,
810 F.2d 925, 929 (10th Cir. 1987), the court held that a "single fraudulent
scheme that has a definite purpose, the completion of which will end the
scheme" does not establish a pattern.
However, the court contrasted this with "one scheme involving one victim,
but the plan contemplates open-ended fraudulent activity and does not have
a single goal that, when achieved, will bring the activity to an end." In such
cases, the open-ended nature of the scheme may satisfy the continuity
requirement even absent multiple discrete schemes.
Emphasis on Congressional Intent
The 10th Circuit frequently grounds its analysis in RICO's legislative history
and congressional intent. As referenced in Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d 751, 761
(10th Cir. 2010), "The Supreme Court has determined 'that when Congress
said predicates must demonstrate `continuity' before they may form a RICO
pattern, it expressed an intent that RICO reach activities that amount to or
threaten long-term criminal activity.'"
This focus on congressional intent serves as a guiding principle in
distinguishing between ordinary criminal conduct and the type of sustained
criminal activity that RICO was designed to address.

Practical Application in Recent 10th Circuit
Cases
Recent cases in the 10th Circuit illustrate the practical application of these
continuity principles.
Johnson v. Heath (2022)
In Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851 (10th Cir. 2022), the 10th Circuit
reiterated that continuity "depends on the specific facts of each case" and
provided a clear articulation of the distinction between closed-ended and
open-ended continuity. The court explained that closed-ended continuity
refers to "a closed period of repeated racketeering conduct," while open-
ended continuity consists of "racketeering conduct that threatens future
repetition."
The court further clarified that plaintiffs can establish open-ended continuity
by showing that "the racketeering acts involved implicit or explicit threats of
repetition, that they formed the operations of an association that exists for
criminal purposes, or that they were the defendants' regular way of
conducting a legitimate enterprise."
Nation v. Shah (2024)
In Nation v. Shah, 4:19-cv-00588-JDR-JFJ (N.D. Okla. Oct 30, 2024), a district
court within the 10th Circuit emphasized the challenge of establishing
continuity, describing it as "more problematic" and "more difficult to meet"
than the relationship requirement.
The court reiterated the dual approaches to continuity, noting that closed-
ended continuity requires "a closed period of repeated racketeering
conduct," while open-ended continuity can be established when racketeering
acts "involved implicit or explicit threats of repetition," "formed the
operations of an association that exists for criminal purposes," or were "part
of the defendants' regular way of conducting a legitimate enterprise."
Suddath v. Oklahome Homebuilders, LLC (2024)
In Suddath v. Oklahome Homebuilders, LLC, CIV-24-745-SLP (W.D. Okla.
Nov 08, 2024), another district court within the 10th Circuit provided a
comprehensive overview of RICO requirements, including the continuity
element of the pattern requirement.
The court explained that the continuity requirement "expresses
congressional intent that 'RICO reach activities that amount to or threaten
long-term criminal activity,'" and reiterated that continuity "is both a closed-
and open-ended concept." The court clarified that a closed-ended series of
predicate acts is insufficient to support a finding of a pattern where those
acts "constitute[] a single scheme to accomplish 'one discrete goal,' directed
at one individual with no potential to extend to other persons or entities."

Challenges in Establishing Continuity
Establishing continuity in RICO claims presents several challenges for
plaintiffs in the 10th Circuit.
Temporal Challenges for Closed-Ended Continuity
For closed-ended continuity, the requirement of a "substantial period of
time" can be difficult to satisfy, particularly in cases involving schemes that
unfold relatively quickly. While the 10th Circuit has not established a
specific timeframe that qualifies as "substantial," it has indicated that
periods of "weeks or months" are generally insufficient.
This temporal requirement can be particularly challenging for plaintiffs
alleging fraud schemes that, while involving multiple acts and potentially
significant harm, occur within a compressed timeframe.
Predictive Challenges for Open-Ended Continuity
For open-ended continuity, the challenge lies in demonstrating a credible
threat of future criminal activity. This requires plaintiffs to present evidence
suggesting that the criminal conduct is likely to continue, which can be
difficult when the conduct in question has been interrupted by law
enforcement action or the filing of the lawsuit itself.
The 10th Circuit's requirement of a "clear threat of future criminal conduct
related to past criminal conduct" sets a high bar that requires more than
mere speculation about potential future activities.
Overcoming the Single Scheme Limitation
Given the 10th Circuit's skepticism toward finding continuity in single-
scheme cases with discrete objectives, plaintiffs facing such circumstances
must carefully frame their allegations to emphasize either the substantial
duration of the scheme (for closed-ended continuity) or the threat of future
similar activity (for open-ended continuity).
This may involve highlighting the ongoing nature of the enterprise, the
defendants' history of similar conduct, or the structure of the scheme itself
as indicative of a continuing threat rather than a one-time event.
Conclusion
Civil RICO claims in the 10th Circuit require plaintiffs to demonstrate a
pattern of racketeering activity, which includes both relationship and
continuity among the predicate acts. While the relationship requirement is
relatively straightforward, the continuity requirement presents a more
substantial challenge.

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The 10th Circuit recognizes two forms of continuity: closed-ended and open-
ended. Closed-ended continuity requires a series of related predicates
extending over a substantial period of time, with acts spanning only weeks
or months being insufficient. Open-ended continuity requires showing that
past conduct projects into the future with a threat of repetition, which can
be established by demonstrating that the predicates involve a threat of long-
term activity, form the operations of a criminal association, or constitute a
regular way of conducting business.
In applying these standards, the 10th Circuit conducts a fact-specific
analysis that considers not only the temporal aspects of the alleged pattern
but also factors such as the number of victims, variety of predicate acts,
distinctness of injuries, and complexity of the scheme. This holistic approach
reflects the court's commitment to implementing RICO in a manner
consistent with congressional intent while avoiding its application to
ordinary criminal conduct or isolated offenders.
For practitioners bringing or defending RICO claims in the 10th Circuit,
understanding these nuanced requirements for establishing pattern through
continuity is essential to effectively navigating this complex area of law.

Extract
To prove a claim under § 1962(c), the Plaintiff must show that PIIGI (1)
participated in the conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of
racketeering activity... The Supreme Court has concluded that Congress
intended that the pattern element 'requires the showing of a relationship
between the predicates, ... and the threat of continuing activity'--that is,
'continuity plus relationship.'... Open-ended continuity depends upon the
facts of each case, and may be established by showing that the predicates

themselves involve a distinct threat of long-term racketeering activity, either
implicit or explicit, or that the predicates are a regular way of conducting

Summary
To establish a RICO claim under § 1962(c) in the Tenth Circuit, a plaintiff
must demonstrate participation in the conduct of an enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity. The pattern element requires showing a
relationship between predicate acts and a threat of continuing activity,
known as "continuity plus relationship." Open-ended continuity can be
shown by demonstrating a distinct threat of long-term racketeering activity
or that the predicates are a regular way of conducting the defendant's
business.

Appellant contends the trial court erred in dismissing his claim under 18
U.S.C. Sec. 1961, et seq. or the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act. In Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925, 927-929 (10th
Cir.), we discussed what a plaintiff must plead in order to establish a RICO
violation: 'A violation of section 1962(c) thus 'requires (1) conduct (2) of an

(1985). RICO defines racketeering activity as, inter alia, any act that is
indictable under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341 (mail fraud) or 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343
(wire fraud). See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1961(1)(B). RICO also states that a '
"pattern of racketeering activity" requires at least two acts of racketeering
activity.' 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1961(5). ... [T]o establish a RICO pattern, a plaintiff
must also demonstrate continuity, that is, 'the threat of continuing activity.'
Sedima, 105 S.Ct. at 3285 n. 14. This element is derived from RICO's
legislative history, which indicates that RICO does not apply to 'sporadic
activity' or to the 'isolated offender'. Id. 'The continuity requirement has
been the source of considerable difficulty. Courts generally agree that to
make an adequate showing of continuity under Sedima, a plaintiff must
demonstrate some facts from which at least a threat of ongoing illegal
conduct may be inferred. A scheme to achieve a single discrete objective
does not in and of itself create a threat of ongoing activity, even when that
goal is pursued by multiple illegal acts, because the scheme ends when the
purpose is accomplished.'
Summary
Continuity involves showing a threat of ongoing illegal conduct,
distinguishing between sporadic or isolated activities and those that suggest

a continuing threat. This is crucial for understanding both open-ended and
closed-ended continuity in RICO claims.

requires continuous and related racketeering acts. ... However, to establish
a RICO pattern, a plaintiff must also demonstrate continuity, that is, 'the

Summary
Requirements for a RICO violation under section 1962(c), emphasizing the
need for conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.
It highlights that a pattern requires at least two acts of racketeering activity
and must demonstrate continuity and relationship. The passage also
discusses the concept of continuity, noting that it involves the threat of
continuing activity. It distinguishes between closed-ended continuity, which
involves a series of related acts over a substantial period, and open-ended
continuity, which involves ongoing schemes without a single goal that would
end the activity. This information is directly relevant to understanding the
legal standards for RICO civil claims in the Tenth Circuit.

1261-62. But the predicate acts at issue must "extend over a substantial
period of time; a few weeks or months is considered insubstantial." Midwest
Grinding Co. v. Spitz, 976 F.2d 1016, 1025 (7th Cir. 1992) (alterations
adopted, quoting H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 242 (1989)). The
predicate acts must also affect more than a single victim and aim to
accomplish more than one discrete goal.
Summary
Elements required for a civil RICO claim in the 10th Circuit, which include
involvement with an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. It
specifies that racketeering activity includes acts indictable under federal
law, such as mail and wire fraud. Importantly, it notes that predicate acts
must extend over a substantial period and affect more than one victim or
goal, which relates to the concept of continuity in RICO claims. However, the
passage does not explicitly differentiate between open-ended and closed-
ended continuity.

Extract
More difficult to establish-and more problematic for Plaintiffs-is the
requirement that the predicate acts have sufficient “continuity” to constitute
a RICO “pattern.” See Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d 751, 761 (10th Cir. 2010)
(indicating that the continuity requirement “is more difficult to
meet” (citation and quotation marks omitted)). For RICO purposes,
continuity comes in one of two forms: Closed-ended continuity can be
established by alleging a “closed period of repeated racketeering conduct.”
Johnson, 56 F.4th at 859-60 (citing H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241-43). Open-ended
continuity can be established by racketeering acts that “involved implicit or
explicit threats of repetition,” “formed the operations of an association that
exists for criminal purposes,” or were part of the defendants' “regular way
of conducting a legitimate enterprise.” Id. (citing?/. J. Inc., 492 U.S. at
241-43). A plaintiff who cannot establish one of these two forms of continuity
cannot state a viable claim under RICO. E.g., Bixler, 596 F.3d at 761
(affirming dismissal where the complaint failed to allege either the closed-
ended or open-ended continuity of predicate acts required to form a RICO
pattern).
Summary
Detailed explanation of the continuity requirement for RICO claims in the
10th Circuit, distinguishing between closed-ended and open-ended
continuity. It cites relevant case law and explains the criteria for each type
of continuity, which are essential for establishing a RICO pattern.

Skurkey v. Daniel
U.S. District Court — Western District of Oklahoma
Extract
To plead a valid RICO claim, a plaintiff must plausibly allege that a
defendant “(1) conducted the affairs (2) of an enterprise (3) through a
pattern (4) of racketeering activity.” ... A “pattern” requires at least two
predicate acts. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). Predicate acts must be violations of
certain statutes, 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), here alleged to be federal mail fraud
and wire fraud statutes. Additionally, a Plaintiff must allege facts from which
the Court can conclude the existence of a pattern, that is that the
“predicates themselves amount to, or that they otherwise constitute a threat
of, continuing racketeering activity.” H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell
Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229, 240 (1989) (emphasis original). The Supreme
Court has explained that there are two elements to finding a pattern for
RICO purposes: “continuity plus relationship.” ... [C]losed-ended continuity
consists of a closed period of repeated, related racketeering acts that do not
necessarily threaten future repetition. ... closed-ended continuity requires a
series of related racketeering acts over a “substantial period of time.” ... In
evaluating whether the Plaintiff has pled sufficient facts to support the
extensiveness prong the Court considers “'the number of victims, the
number of racketeering acts, the variety of racketeering acts, whether the
injuries were distinct, the complexity and size of the scheme, and the nature
or character of the enterprise.” ... The same holds true if the Court considers
whether Plaintiff has alleged continuity under an open-ended theory because
Plaintiff has not alleged facts that show a clear threat of future criminal
conduct related to past criminal conduct.
Summary
Detailed explanation of the legal standards for RICO civil claims in the Tenth
Circuit, specifically addressing the requirements for establishing a "pattern"
of racketeering activity. It outlines the necessity of demonstrating both
"continuity" and "relationship" among predicate acts. The passage
distinguishes between closed-ended continuity, which involves a substantial
period of repeated acts, and open-ended continuity, which requires a threat
of future criminal conduct. The passage also provides criteria for evaluating
the extensiveness of the racketeering scheme, which is crucial for
establishing closed-ended continuity.
Condict v. Condict, 815 F.2d 579 (10th Cir. 1987)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
As many commentators have pointed out, the definition of a 'pattern of
racketeering activity' differs from the other provisions in Sec. 1961 in that it
states that a pattern 'requires at least two acts of racketeering activity,' Sec.
1961(5) (emphasis added), not that it 'means' two such acts. The implication
is that while two acts are necessary, they may not be sufficient. Indeed, in
common parlance two of anything do not generally form a 'pattern.' The
legislative history supports the view that two isolated acts of racketeering
activity do not constitute a pattern. As the Senate Report explained: 'The
target of [RICO] is thus not sporadic activity. The infiltration of legitimate
business normally requires more than one 'racketeering activity' and the
threat of continuing activity to be effective. It is this factor of continuity plus
relationship which combines to produce a pattern.' ... A more difficult
question is presented when the RICO claim is based on one scheme
involving one victim, but the plan contemplates open-ended fraudulent
activity and does not have a single goal that, when achieved, will bring the
activity to an end. Some courts have found that such an ongoing scheme is
itself sufficient to satisfy the continuity element of a RICO pattern. See, e.g.,
Morgan v. Bank of Waukegan, 804 F.2d 970, 976 (7th Cir.1986); see also
Illinois Dept. of Revenue v. Phillips, 771 F.2d 312 (7th Cir.1985). Other
courts may require additional proof showing that the defendants have
engaged in similar activity in the past, or have been involved in other
criminal activity, or pose a threat of similar activity in the future.
Summary
Requirements for establishing a "pattern of racketeering activity" under
RICO, emphasizing that two acts are necessary but not always sufficient. It
highlights the need for continuity and relationship, explaining that sporadic
or isolated acts do not meet the standard. The passage also addresses the
concept of open-ended continuity, where a scheme without a single goal may
satisfy the continuity requirement if it poses a threat of ongoing fraudulent
activity. This is relevant to understanding the legal standards for RICO
claims in the Tenth Circuit.

Specifically, the defendants concede that an actionable RICO claim need not
allege a distinct RICO injury, nor need it allege that the defendants have
already been indicted for, or convicted of, the predicate acts of mail or wire
fraud, or that the defendants had ties to organized crime. However, the
defendants do argue that under Sedima the plaintiffs must still allege that
the defendants are conducting, or are participating in conducting, the affairs
of an 'enterprise,' i.e., Condict Ranches, 'through a pattern of racketeering
activity.' ... In this case, the court and the parties assumed for purposes of

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the court's ruling that defendants engaged in numerous racketeering acts. It
is clear that when, as here, the acts are part of a common fraudulent
scheme, they satisfy the relationship requirement of Sedima. ... However, to
establish a RICO pattern, a plaintiff must also demonstrate continuity, that
is, 'the threat of continuing activity.' Sedima, 105 S.Ct. at 3285 n. 14. This
element is derived from RICO's legislative history, which indicates that RICO
does not apply to 'sporadic activity' or to the 'isolated offender'. ... A more
difficult question is presented when the RICO claim is based on one scheme
involving one victim, but the plan contemplates open-ended fraudulent
activity and does not have a single goal that, when achieved, will bring the
activity to an end. Some courts have found that such an ongoing scheme is
itself sufficient to satisfy the continuity element of a RICO pattern.
Summary
For a RICO claim in the Tenth Circuit, it is not necessary to allege a distinct
RICO injury or that the defendants have been indicted or convicted of
predicate acts. However, plaintiffs must allege that defendants are
conducting an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. The
passage highlights the importance of demonstrating continuity, which
involves showing a threat of ongoing activity. The passage also discusses the
distinction between open-ended and closed-ended continuity, noting that an
ongoing scheme without a single goal may satisfy the continuity
requirement.

U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
In H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106
L.Ed.2d 195 (1989), the Supreme Court reiterated the well-established
concept that racketeering acts form a 'pattern' in RICO where they exhibit
'continuity plus relationship.' Id. at 239, 109 S.Ct. at 2900. The 'relationship'
requirement is satisfied when the racketeering acts have 'the same or
similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or
otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not
isolated events.' Id. at 240, 109 S.Ct. at 2901 (citing Sedima, 473 U.S. at 496
n. 14, 105 S.Ct. at 3285 n. 14). With respect to the 'continuity' requirement,
the Supreme Court stated that the predicate acts must amount to, or pose a
threat of, continuing racketeering activity. Id. According to the Supreme
Court, continuity 'is both a closed- and open-ended concept, referring to a
closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature
projects into the future with a threat of repetition.' Id. A RICO plaintiff 'may
demonstrate continuity over a closed period by proving a series of related
predicates extending over a substantial period of time.' Id. Predicates
extending over merely a few weeks or months, on the other hand, may
satisfy the continuity element if there is a threat of repetition in the future.
This latter concept of continuity, which occurs over an 'open period,' is

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
established by showing that the predicate acts are a 'regular way of
conducting the enterprise's ongoing business.'
Summary
The passage explains the requirements for establishing a "pattern" of
racketeering activity under RICO, which includes both "continuity" and
"relationship." The "continuity" requirement can be satisfied through either
a closed-ended or open-ended approach. Closed-ended continuity involves a
series of related predicates over a substantial period, while open-ended
continuity involves predicates that pose a threat of future repetition. This
explanation is based on the Supreme Court's interpretation, which is
applicable to RICO claims in the Tenth Circuit.

In this case, the court and the parties assumed for purposes of the court's
ruling that defendants engaged in numerous racketeering acts. It is clear
that when, as here, the acts are part of a common fraudulent scheme, they
satisfy the relationship requirement of Sedima. See, e.g., Superior Oil Co. v.
Fulmer, 785 F.2d 252 (8th Cir.1986). However, to establish a RICO pattern, a
plaintiff must also demonstrate continuity, that is, 'the threat of continuing
activity.' Sedima, 105 S.Ct. at 3285 n. 14. This element is derived from
RICO's legislative history, which indicates that RICO does not apply to
'sporadic activity' or to the 'isolated offender.' Id. The continuity requirement
has been the source of considerable difficulty. Courts generally agree that to
make an adequate showing of continuity under Sedima, a plaintiff must
demonstrate some facts from which at least a threat of ongoing illegal
conduct may be inferred. A scheme to achieve a single discrete objective
does not in and of itself create a threat of ongoing activity, even when that
goal is pursued by multiple illegal acts, because the scheme ends when the
purpose is accomplished. Courts that have considered a RICO claim
grounded on this type of scheme have therefore required some additional
evidence showing that the scheme was not an isolated occurrence. See, e.g.,
Lipin Enters. Inc. v. Lee, 803 F.2d 322, 324 (7th Cir.1986) (acts to defraud
one victim one time insufficient in absence of showing of other victims or
other frauds). A more difficult question is presented when the RICO claim is
based on one scheme involving one victim, but the plan contemplates open-
ended fraudulent activity and does not have a single goal that, when
achieved, will bring the activity to an end. Some courts have found that such
an ongoing scheme is itself sufficient to satisfy the continuity element of a
RICO pattern. See, e.g., Morgan v. Bank of Waukegan, 804 F.2d 970, 976
(7th Cir.1986); see also Illinois Dept. of Revenue v. Phillips, 771 F.2d 312
(7th Cir.1985). Other courts may require additional proof showing that the

involved in other criminal activity, or pose a threat of similar activity in the
future. See, e.g., Superior Oil Co., 785 F.2d at 257.
Summary
Detailed explanation of the continuity requirement for RICO claims,
distinguishing between closed-ended and open-ended continuity. It explains
that a single scheme with a discrete objective does not imply ongoing
activity, whereas an open-ended scheme without a single goal may satisfy
the continuity requirement. This is crucial for understanding how courts in
the Tenth Circuit evaluate RICO claims.

RICO provides a civil cause of action for treble damages to anyone injured
“by reason of” certain racketeering activity. 18 U.S.C. §§ 1964(c), 1962. “To
plead a valid RICO claim, a plaintiff must plausibly allege that a defendant
(1) conducted the affairs (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of
racketeering activity.” Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851, 858 (10th Cir. 2022)
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Defendants challenge, inter
alia, the sufficiency of Plaintiffs' allegations with respect to the third element
- a “pattern” of racketeering activity. “A ‘pattern’ requires at least two
predicate acts.” Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d 751, 761 (10th Cir. 2010) (citing 18
U.S.C. § 1961(5)). And those predicate acts themselves must amount to or
otherwise constitute a threat of continuing racketeering activity. Id. This
continuity requirement expresses congressional intent that “RICO reach
activities that amount to or threaten long-term criminal activity.” Id. (citing
H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tele. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 243 n. 4 (1989)).
“‘Continuity’ is both a closed-and open-ended concept: closed-ended
referring to a closed period of repeated conduct and open-ended referring to
conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of
repetition.” Resol. Tr. Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993).
“A party alleging a RICO violation may demonstrate continuity over a closed
period by proving a series of related predicates extending over a substantial
period of time.” Id. A closed-ended series of predicate acts is not sufficient
to support a finding of a pattern of racketeering activity, however, where
those acts “constitute[ ] a single scheme to accomplish ‘one discrete goal,’
directed at one individual with no potential to extend to other persons or
entities.” Open-ended continuity “may be established by showing that the
predicates themselves involve a distinct threat of long-term racketeering
activity, either implicit or explicit, or that the predicates are a regular way of
conducting the defendant's ongoing legitimate business or the RICO
enterprise.” Resol. Tr., 998 F.2d at 1543. “Open-ended continuity requires a
clear threat of future criminal conduct related to past criminal conduct.”

U.S. District Court — District of Utah
Extract
In Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925 (10th Cir.1986), the Tenth Circuit
stressed in a single scheme case that the 'continuity' requirement of pattern
requires demonstration of 'facts from which at least a threat of ongoing
illegal conduct may be inferred,' and that the single scheme would have to
involve 'continuous behavior.' ... It may be inferred from Torwest that 'a
scheme that contemplated open-ended fraudulent activity over a period of
time' would point to a different result than the scheme with which the court
was confronted in that case. Torwest involved 'numerous racketeering acts'
but only 'one victim,' 'one time,' and 'one discrete goal' thus constituting an
'isolated incident.'
Summary
The passage provides insight into the Tenth Circuit's interpretation of the
continuity requirement for RICO claims. It references the case Torwest DBC,
Inc. v. Dick, which is a precedent in the Tenth Circuit. The court in Torwest
emphasized the need for demonstrating a threat of ongoing illegal conduct
to satisfy the continuity requirement. The passage also distinguishes
between closed-ended continuity, which involves a single scheme with a
discrete goal, and open-ended continuity, which involves a scheme that
contemplates ongoing fraudulent activity.

The Tenth Circuit has yet to 'formulate a bright-line test' for determining the
existence of a 'pattern'. Torwest DBC, Inc., v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925, 929 (10th
Cir.1987). In Torwest, it found what was not a pattern: a single fraudulent
scheme that has a definite purpose, the completion of which will end the
scheme. In reaching this decision, the Tenth Circuit contrasted the type of
scheme involved in this case, stating: A more difficult question is presented
when the RICO claim is based on one scheme involving one victim, but the
plan contemplates open-ended fraudulent activity and does not have a single
goal that, when achieved, will bring the activity to an end. Some courts have
found that such an ongoing scheme is itself sufficient to satisfy the
continuity element of a RICO pattern.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the Tenth Circuit's approach to
determining a "pattern" of racketeering activity under RICO. It highlights
that the Tenth Circuit has not established a definitive test but has
considered the nature of the scheme, particularly distinguishing between
schemes with a definite end and those that are open-ended. The court
suggests that an open-ended scheme may satisfy the continuity requirement,
at least at the pleading stage.
Joseph v. U.S. Pub. Defenders Office
U.S. District Court — District of New Mexico
Extract
RICO was enacted to address “racketeering activity.” The statute defines
“racketeering activity” to encompass specified state and federal offenses,
which are referred to as predicate acts. These predicate acts include any act
indictable under enumerated federal statutes, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961(1)(B)-(C),
(E)-(G), specified crimes chargeable under state law, § 1961(1)(A), and any
offense involving bankruptcy or securities fraud or drug-related activity that
is punishable under federal law, § 1961(1)(D). Predicate acts can give rise to
a RICO claim when they are part of a “pattern of racketeering activity, ”
which is defined as a series of related predicates that together demonstrate
the existence or threat of continued criminal activity. H.J. Inc. v. N.W. Bell
Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239 (1989).
Summary

addition, '[t]o satisfy RICO's pattern requirement, [a plaintiff must] allege
not only that the defendants had committed two or more predicate acts, but
also that the predicates themselves amount to, or that they otherwise
constitute a threat of, continuing racketeering activity.' Hall v. Witteman,
584 F.3d 859, 867 (10th Cir.2009) (quotation omitted). A viable RICO claim
requires a showing of 'continuity plus relationship.' Sedima, 473 U.S. at 496

hand, 'is more difficult to meet.' Id. '`Continuity' is both a closed- and open-
ended concept, referring either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to
past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of

activities that amount to or threaten long-term criminal activity.' Id. at 243
n. 4, 109 S.Ct. 2893.
Summary
Legal standards for RICO civil claims in the Tenth Circuit, specifically
focusing on the requirements for establishing a "pattern" of racketeering
activity. It explains that a RICO claim must allege a violation of 18 U.S.C. §
1962, which includes four elements: conduct, enterprise, pattern, and
racketeering activity. The "pattern" requires at least two predicate acts and
must demonstrate "continuity plus relationship." The passage further
distinguishes between open-ended and closed-ended continuity, explaining
that continuity can refer to a closed period of repeated conduct or past
conduct that projects into the future with a threat of repetition. This is
essential for understanding how to establish a RICO pattern in the Tenth
Circuit.

which occurred within ten years' of each other. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5).
However, because 'RICO is not aimed at the isolated offender,' proof of two
or more predicate acts are not sufficient to prove a pattern unless there is a
relationship between the predicate acts and a threat of continuing activity.
H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239, 109 S.Ct. 2893,
106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989); Duran v. Carris, 238 F.3d 1268, 1271 (10th Cir.
2001). Continuity of threat requires both proof of 'a series of related
predicates extending over a substantial period of time,' as well as a 'showing
that the predicates themselves involve a distinct threat of long-term
racketeering activity ... or that the predicates are a regular way of
conducting the defendant's ongoing legitimate business or the RICO
enterprise.' Resolution Trust Corp., 998 F.2d at 1543. To determine
continuity we examine both the duration of the related predicate acts and
the extensiveness of the RICO enterprise's scheme. Id.
Summary
Detailed explanation of the elements required for a civil RICO claim,
specifically focusing on the necessity of demonstrating a "pattern of
racketeering activity." It clarifies that merely proving two predicate acts is
insufficient; there must be a relationship between these acts and a threat of
ongoing activity. The passage also outlines the requirements for continuity,
which involves either a series of related predicates over a substantial period
or a distinct threat of long-term racketeering activity. This is directly
relevant to understanding the legal standards for RICO claims in the Tenth
Circuit, including the concepts of open-ended and closed-ended continuity.

Summary
The passage provides insight into how the Tenth Circuit approaches the
continuity requirement for RICO claims. It highlights that the Tenth Circuit
uses the H.J. Inc. test, which involves assessing both the duration and the

notes that the Tenth Circuit continues to use a multi-factor test that was
applied before the H.J. Inc. decision, indicating a nuanced approach to
determining continuity.

Extract
The Court outlined two separate ways of establishing continuity: (1) closed-
ended continuity--'a closed period of repeated conduct;' and (2) open-ended
continuity--'past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a
threat of repetition.' Continuity could be established by proving that either
closed-ended continuity or open-ended continuity was present. Continuity, in
both cases, the Court stated, was 'centrally a temporal concept.' Closed-
ended continuity may be proven by demonstrating 'a series of related
predicates extending over a substantial period of time.' The Court declared
that '[p]redicate acts extending over a few weeks or months and threatening
no future criminal conduct do not satisfy this requirement,' because

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Congress's concern in RICO was long-term criminal conduct. Open-ended
continuity, on the other hand, could be present before closed-ended
continuity could be established. Whether open-ended continuity exists
'depends on the specific facts of each case,' the Court explained. 'Without
making any claim to cover the field of possibilities,' the Court presented
three examples of how this 'open-ended continuity' could be proven: (1) 'if
the related predicates themselves involve a distinct threat of long-term
racketeering activity, either implicit or explicit;' (2) if the predicate acts are
part of the 'regular way of doing business' of a 'long-term association that
exists for criminal purposes;' or (3) if the predicates are 'a regular way of
conducting the defendant's ongoing legitimate business' or RICO enterprise.
Summary
Criteria for both types of continuity, which are essential for establishing a
pattern of racketeering activity under RICO. This information is applicable
to RICO claims in general, including those in the 10th Circuit.

Extract
Under the “less inflexible approach” adopted in H.J. Inc., continuity is “both
a closed- and open-ended concept.” Id. at 241. Closed-ended continuity
refers “to a closed period of repeated conduct,” while open-ended continuity
denotes “past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a
threat of repetition.” Closed-ended continuity may be demonstrated with
proof of “a series of related predicates extending over a substantial period of
time.” Id. at 242 (“Predicate acts extending over a few weeks or months and
threatening no future criminal conduct do not satisfy this requirement:
Congress was concerned in RICO with long-term criminal conduct.”). Open-
ended continuity, in contrast, requires proof of “a threat of continued
racketeering activity.” Id. at 242.
Summary
Detailed explanation of the concepts of closed-ended and open-ended
continuity as they relate to RICO claims. Closed-ended continuity requires a
series of related predicate acts over a substantial period, while open-ended
continuity involves a threat of continued racketeering activity. This

Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity. ...
There has been substantial litigation regarding what constitutes a “pattern”
of racketeering activity, what an “enterprise” can consist of, and what must
be alleged to plead and prove “conduct” of same through a pattern of
racketeering activity. ... The most prominently litigated subsection of § 1962
is § 1962(c). A plaintiff only has standing to sue if they have been injured in
their business or property by conduct constituting the violation. To establish
a § 1962(c) RICO claim, the following elements must be proven: •
Enterprise: A structured group of individuals associated for a common
purpose. • Pattern of racketeering activity: At least two acts of racketeering,
as specified within the statute, within 10 years. • Conduct: Directly or
indirectly conducting the enterprise’s affairs through racketeering. • Injury:
An injury to business or property due to the racketeering activity.
Summary
Detailed explanation of the elements required to establish a civil RICO claim
under § 1962(c), which includes conduct, enterprise, pattern of racketeering
activity, and injury. It also highlights the necessity of pleading fraud with
particularity when mail or wire fraud is involved. The passage does not
specifically address the Tenth Circuit or the requirements for open-ended
versus closed-ended continuity, but it does provide a foundational
understanding of the general legal standards for RICO civil claims.
RICO: A Primer

The continuity requirement is likewise satisfied where the predicates are a
regular way of conducting the defendant's ongoing legitimate business (in
the sense that it is not a business that exists for criminal purposes), or of
conducting or participating in an ongoing and legitimate RICO 'enterprise.'
A plaintiff may demonstrate a pattern by establishment that the predicate
acts pose a threat of continued criminal activity, which is generally
demonstrated by showing either: * Closed-ended continuity. Proving 'a series
of related predicate acts extending over a substantial period of time.' *
Open-ended continuity. A threat of 'continuing criminal activity extending
indefinitely into the future,' in light of the nature of the enterprise and
predicate acts alleged.
