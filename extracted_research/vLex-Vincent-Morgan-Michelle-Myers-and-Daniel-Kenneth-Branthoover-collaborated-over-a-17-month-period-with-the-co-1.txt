Question
Morgan Michelle Myers and Daniel Kenneth Branthoover collaborated over
a 17-month period with the common goal of preparing fraudulent documents
to influence Texas courts and remove Charles Dustin Myers from his home.
An enterprise under RICO can be any group of individuals associated in fact,
even if it is not a formal legal entity, as long as it has a common purpose and
functions as a continuing unit. (United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576
(1981)). The collaboration between Morgan and Daniel, with a shared goal
and coordinated actions over an extended period, constitutes an
"association-in-fact" enterprise under RICO.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Based on the established statutory and case law interpretation of RICO, the
17-month collaboration between Morgan Michelle Myers and Daniel
Kenneth Branthoover with the shared goal of preparing fraudulent
documents to influence Texas courts likely constitutes an "association-in-
fact" enterprise under RICO. Their prolonged relationship with a common
purpose, coordinated actions, and sufficient longevity meets the three
structural features required for an association-in-fact enterprise as
established in United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576 (1981) and further
clarified in Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009).
Summary
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) defines an
"enterprise" broadly to include "any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity" (18 U.S.C. § 1961(4)). The
Supreme Court has consistently interpreted this definition expansively,
establishing that an association-in-fact enterprise requires three essential
structural features: a purpose, relationships among those associated with
the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue
the enterprise's purpose. The alleged 17-month collaboration between
Morgan Michelle Myers and Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, characterized by a
common goal of preparing fraudulent documents to influence Texas courts
and coordinated actions over an extended period, satisfies these
requirements.
The courts have consistently maintained that an association-in-fact
enterprise under RICO does not require a formal legal structure,
hierarchical organization, or chain of command. Rather, the focus is on
whether the individuals are associated together for a common purpose of
engaging in a course of conduct, functioning as a continuing unit with
sufficient longevity to accomplish their objectives. In this case, Morgan and

Daniel's alleged 17-month collaboration with the specific goal of creating
fraudulent documents to influence Texas courts and remove Charles Dustin
Myers from his home demonstrates the purpose, relationship, and longevity
necessary to establish an association-in-fact enterprise under RICO, even
without a formal legal structure connecting them.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislation
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provides
the statutory framework for addressing organized criminal activity. Two key
provisions are particularly relevant to assessing whether Morgan Michelle
Myers and Daniel Kenneth Branthoover's alleged collaboration constitutes
an association-in-fact enterprise under RICO.
First, 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4) defines an "enterprise" under RICO. According to
this provision, an "enterprise" "includes any individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity." This definition
explicitly recognizes that a group of individuals associated in fact, even
without forming a legal entity, can constitute an enterprise under RICO.
Second, 18 U.S.C. § 1962 outlines prohibited activities under RICO. This
section makes it unlawful for "any person through a pattern of racketeering
activity or through collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or maintain,
directly or indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise which is
engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce." It also prohibits any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise from conducting or participating in the enterprise's affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity.
Case Law
The Supreme Court and lower federal courts have extensively interpreted
what constitutes an "association-in-fact" enterprise under RICO. The
landmark case is United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576 (1981), where the
Supreme Court established the foundation for understanding association-in-
fact enterprises. In Turkette, the Court stated that an enterprise "is an
entity, for present purposes a group of persons associated together for a
common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct... [This element] is
proved by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by
evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit."
The Supreme Court further clarified the requirements for an association-in-
fact enterprise in Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009). In Boyle, the
Court established that "an association-in-fact enterprise must have at least
three structural features: a purpose, relationships among those associated
with the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these associates to
pursue the enterprise's purpose." Importantly, the Court in Boyle explicitly
rejected the requirement that an association-in-fact enterprise must have

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
"an ascertainable structure beyond that inherent in the pattern of
racketeering activity."
Recent case law continues to apply and elaborate on these principles. In 
McGillvary v. Scutari, 23-cv-22605-JMY (D. N.J. Dec 23, 2024), the court
reaffirmed that an association-in-fact RICO enterprise requires three
features: "a purpose, relationships among those associated with the
enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the
enterprise's purpose." The court also noted that "the very concept of an
association in fact is expansive, in keeping with RICO's directive that its
terms are to be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes."
Similarly, in United States v. Denava (N.D. Ill. 2023), the court emphasized
that all that is required to establish a RICO enterprise is "evidence of an
ongoing organization, formal or informal, and ... evidence that the various
associates function as a continuing unit."
In United States v. Kelly, 609 F.Supp.3d 85 (E.D. N.Y. 2022), the court
reiterated that the definition of enterprise under RICO is "obviously broad"
and that "the term 'any' ensures that the definition has a wide reach." The
court further clarified that "an association-in-fact enterprise is simply a
continuing unit that functions with a common purpose."
Additional cases provide further guidance on what constitutes an
association-in-fact enterprise. In Brown v. Hanover Am. Ins. Co., Case No.
2:20-cv-02415 (W.D. Tenn. Jul 14, 2021), the court noted that an association-
in-fact enterprise "can be proven by evidence of an ongoing organization,
formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a
continuing unit."
In In re Juul Labs, Inc., Mktg., Sales Practices, & Prods. Liab. Litig., 497
F.Supp.3d 552 (N.D. Cal. 2020), the court emphasized that an "associated-in-
fact enterprise under RICO does not require any particular organizational
structure, separate or otherwise," and can be made up of parts of an
otherwise legitimate business entity.
The court in Bd. of Managers of Trump Tower at City Ctr. Condo. v.
Palazzolo, 346 F.Supp.3d 432 (S.D. N.Y. 2018) explained that an association-
in-fact enterprise means "a group of persons associated together for a
common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct," which "is proved by
evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by evidence
that the various associates function as a continuing unit."
In United States v. Fisher, Case No. 15-20652 (E.D. Mich. Aug 27, 2018), the
court stated that an association-in-fact racketeering enterprise "must be a
continuing unit that functions with a common purpose" and must have "a
purpose, relationships among those associated with the racketeering
enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the
racketeering enterprises' purpose."
The court in Allstate Ins. Co. v. Benhamou, 190 F.Supp.3d 631 (S.D. Tex.
2016) noted that "an association-in-fact enterprise is simply a continuing
unit that functions with a common purpose and course of conduct." The

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
court further clarified that although each member of the enterprise must
share this common purpose, "the enterprise concept is broad" and an
association need not have a "hierarchical structure," a "chain of command,"
or any formalized procedures.
In Chambers v. King Buick GMC, LLC, 43 F. Supp. 3d 575 (D. Md. 2014), the
court stated that a RICO enterprise is characterized by "continuity, unity,
shared purpose and identifiable structure" and requires proof of three
elements: "(1) an ongoing organization; (2) associates functioning as a
continuing unit; and (3) the enterprise is an entity 'separate and apart from
the pattern of activity in which it engages.'"
In Empire Title Servs., Inc. v. Fifth Third Mortg. Co., CASE NO. 1:10cv2208
(N.D. Ohio Mar 29, 2013), the court reiterated that an association-in-fact
enterprise must have a structure bearing three features: "(1) 'a purpose,' (2)
'relationships among those associated with the enterprise,' and (3) 'longevity
sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose.'"
Earlier cases also support this interpretation. In United States v. Larson, 07-
CR-304S (W.D. N.Y. Dec 05, 2011), the court noted that the RICO statute's
terms are to be "liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes" and
identified the same three structural features for an association-in-fact RICO
enterprise.
In Aarp v. American Family Prepaid Legal Corp., Inc., 604 F.Supp.2d 785
(M.D. N.C. 2009), the court described an association-in-fact RICO enterprise
as "a group of persons associated together for a common purpose of
engaging in a course of conduct" that is characterized by "continuity, unity,
shared purpose and identifiable structure."
The court in U.S. v. International Longshoremen's Ass'n, 518 F.Supp.2d 422
(E.D. N.Y. 2007) emphasized that "there is no restriction upon the
associations embraced by the definition: an enterprise includes any union or
group of individuals associated in fact," including both legitimate ventures
and wholly criminal organizations.
In U.S. v. Battle, 473 F.Supp.2d 1185 (S.D. Fla. 2006), the court stated that
an enterprise is "a group of persons associated together for a common
purpose of engaging in a course of conduct.... [This element] is proved by
evidence of an on going organization, formal or informal, and by evidence
that the various associates function as a continuing unit."
An older case, Standard Chlorine of Delaware, Inc. v. Sinibaldi, 821 F.Supp.
232 (D. Del. 1992), listed the essential elements of a RICO enterprise as "(1)
the enterprise is an ongoing organization, with some form of structure which
is used in making and carrying out decisions; (2) the enterprise members
function as a continuing unit with established duties; and (3) the enterprise
has an existence separate from the pattern of racketeering activity in which
it engages."
In Ris v. Bedell, 699 F.Supp. 429 (S.D. N.Y. 1988), the court emphasized the
requirement of "continuity plus relationship" with respect to the RICO
enterprise, defining it as a "group associated 'for a common purpose of

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
engaging in a course of conduct' which 'is proved by evidence of an ongoing
organization, formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates
function as a continuing unit.'"
Secondary Materials
Secondary materials further clarify the requirements for establishing an
association-in-fact enterprise under RICO. In "Insurance Fraud is a Violent
Crime" (2024-03-01), it is stated that a RICO conspiracy is established by
proof of "(a) of an agreement to join a racketeering scheme, (b) of the
defendant's knowing engagement in the scheme with the intent that its
overall goals be effectuated, and (c) that the scheme involved, or by
agreement between any members of the conspiracy was intended to involve,
two or more predicate acts of racketeering."
"Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy" (2024-01-01) explains that a violation of §
1962(c) requires "(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4)
of racketeering activity." It further reiterates the statutory definition of
"enterprise" as "any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or
other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity."
In "Corporate Criminal Liability: End It, Don't Mend It" (2022-06-22), it is
noted that RICO imposes liability on persons "employed by or associated
with" organized-crime syndicates or other RICO "enterprises" who "conduct,
or participate in the conduct of, the [enterprise's] affairs" through a "pattern
of racketeering activity." It also highlights the Supreme Court's
interpretation in United States v. Turkette, which allows for purely
illegitimate groups to be considered RICO enterprises.
"RECONCEIVING COERCION-BASED CRIMINAL DEFENSES" (2022-03-22)
discusses the "pattern of racketeering activity" element of RICO, noting that
criminal conduct forms a pattern if it involves criminal acts with "the same
or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission," or are otherwise interrelated and not isolated events. The
Supreme Court characterized this as a "relationship" element and added a
"continuity" element, referring to "a closed period of repeated conduct, or to
past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of
repetition."
Several editions of "RICO: A Primer" (2022-01-31) and "Racketeer
influenced and corrupt organizations" (2011-03-22, 2010-03-22, 2009-03-22,
2008-03-22, 2007-03-22, 2005-03-22) consistently state that a RICO
enterprise includes any group of individuals associated in fact, even if not a
legal entity, and that courts have interpreted "enterprise" broadly to capture
both legitimate and illegitimate enterprises. They emphasize that an
association-in-fact under RICO must have a shared purpose, continuity, and
unity.
In "RICO - the rejection of an economic motive requirement" (1995-03-22), it
is noted that the Supreme Court in Turkette defined an enterprise as "a

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a
course of conduct," without requiring an economic motive.
"Rico and the Prime: Taking a Bite Out of Crime?" (1991) states that there is
no requirement that the enterprise be criminal in character, and that the
enterprise need not be formally organized; it may be an "association-in-fact."
"Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of Action" and "Chapter Five: The Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Statute, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–
1968" both reiterate that an enterprise includes any group of individuals
associated in fact, even if not a legal entity, and that an association-in-fact
enterprise must have a purpose, relationships among those associated with
the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these associations to
pursue the enterprise's purpose.
Analysis
Based on the statutory provisions and case law interpretation, the
collaboration between Morgan Michelle Myers and Daniel Kenneth
Branthoover likely constitutes an "association-in-fact" enterprise under
RICO if the alleged facts are proven. The analysis focuses on whether their
collaboration satisfies the three structural features required for an
association-in-fact enterprise: (1) a purpose, (2) relationships among those
associated with the enterprise, and (3) longevity sufficient to permit these
associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose.
A Common Purpose
The first requirement for an association-in-fact enterprise is a common
purpose. According to the allegations, Morgan Michelle Myers and Daniel
Kenneth Branthoover collaborated with "the common goal of preparing
fraudulent documents to influence Texas courts and remove Charles Dustin
Myers from his home." This clearly demonstrates a shared purpose between
the two individuals, as required by Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 946
(2009) and reaffirmed in cases such as McGillvary v. Scutari, 23-cv-22605-
JMY (D. N.J. Dec 23, 2024).
The Supreme Court in United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583 (1981)
defined an enterprise as "a group of persons associated together for a
common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct." Here, the alleged
common purpose was specific: to prepare fraudulent documents to influence
Texas courts with the ultimate goal of removing Charles Dustin Myers from
his home. This specific, shared objective satisfies the "purpose" requirement
for an association-in-fact enterprise.
Moreover, as noted in In re Juul Labs, Inc., Mktg., Sales Practices, & Prods.
Liab. Litig., 497 F.Supp.3d 552 (N.D. Cal. 2020), "an associated-in-fact
enterprise under RICO does not require any particular organizational
structure, separate or otherwise." Therefore, the lack of a formal
organization between Morgan and Daniel does not preclude finding a
common purpose sufficient to establish an association-in-fact enterprise.

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Relationships Among Associates
The second requirement is the existence of relationships among those
associated with the enterprise. The alleged collaboration between Morgan
Michelle Myers and Daniel Kenneth Branthoover over a 17-month period
suggests an ongoing relationship between the two individuals focused on
their common goal. This relationship is evidenced by their coordinated
actions over an extended period, as noted in the facts.
In United States v. Kelly, 609 F.Supp.3d 85 (E.D. N.Y. 2022), the court
emphasized that "an association-in-fact enterprise is simply a continuing
unit that functions with a common purpose." The 17-month collaboration
between Morgan and Daniel, characterized by coordinated actions to
achieve a common goal, demonstrates the continuing unit functionality
required to establish relationships among associates in an association-in-fact
enterprise.
Additionally, Allstate Ins. Co. v. Benhamou, 190 F.Supp.3d 631 (S.D. Tex.
2016) clarified that an association need not have a "hierarchical structure,"
a "chain of command," or any formalized procedures. This aligns with the
Supreme Court's holding in Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009) that
rejected the requirement for "an ascertainable structure beyond that
inherent in the pattern of racketeering activity." Therefore, even without a
formal organizational structure, the ongoing collaboration and coordination
between Morgan and Daniel over 17 months likely satisfies the relationship
requirement for an association-in-fact enterprise.
Sufficient Longevity
The third requirement is longevity sufficient to permit the associates to
pursue the enterprise's purpose. The alleged collaboration between Morgan
Michelle Myers and Daniel Kenneth Branthoover lasted for 17 months,
which is a substantial period that demonstrates sufficient longevity to
accomplish their common goal.
As stated in Brown v. Hanover Am. Ins. Co., Case No. 2:20-cv-02415 (W.D.
Tenn. Jul 14, 2021), an association-in-fact enterprise requires "longevity
sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose." The
17-month period of collaboration provides ample time for Morgan and
Daniel to pursue their alleged purpose of preparing fraudulent documents to
influence Texas courts and remove Charles Dustin Myers from his home.
Additionally, United States v. Denava (N.D. Ill. 2023) emphasized that all that
is required is "evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal,
and ... evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit."
The extended period of collaboration between Morgan and Daniel, coupled
with their coordinated actions toward a specific goal, suggests they
functioned as a continuing unit with sufficient longevity to establish an
association-in-fact enterprise under RICO.

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Pattern of Racketeering Activity
While not explicitly part of the definition of an association-in-fact enterprise,
it is worth noting that a RICO violation also requires a "pattern of
racketeering activity." According to "RECONCEIVING COERCION-BASED
CRIMINAL DEFENSES" (2022-03-22), criminal conduct forms a pattern if it
involves criminal acts with "the same or similar purposes, results,
participants, victims, or methods of commission," or are otherwise
interrelated and not isolated events.
The alleged preparation of fraudulent documents to influence Texas courts
could potentially constitute predicate acts under RICO, particularly if they
involve mail or wire fraud. The coordinated effort over 17 months suggests
multiple acts rather than isolated incidents, potentially satisfying the
"pattern" requirement if the specific acts qualify as racketeering activities.
As noted in "Insurance Fraud is a Violent Crime" (2024-03-01), a RICO
conspiracy is established by proof of an agreement to join a racketeering
scheme, knowing engagement with intent to effectuate the scheme's goals,
and involvement in two or more predicate acts of racketeering. The alleged
collaboration between Morgan and Daniel appears to satisfy these elements,
assuming the fraudulent documents constitute predicate acts under RICO.
Separation from The Pattern of Racketeering Activity
Some cases, such as Standard Chlorine of Delaware, Inc. v. Sinibaldi, 821
F.Supp. 232 (D. Del. 1992), have required that "the enterprise has an
existence separate from the pattern of racketeering activity in which it
engages." However, this requirement has been relaxed in subsequent cases,
particularly after Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009), which rejected
the need for "an ascertainable structure beyond that inherent in the pattern
of racketeering activity."
As noted in United States v. Larson, 07-CR-304S (W.D. N.Y. Dec 05, 2011),
the Supreme Court in Boyle identified several structural features that must
be possessed by an association-in-fact RICO enterprise: "a purpose,
relationships among those associated with the enterprise, and longevity
sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose." The
collaboration between Morgan and Daniel satisfies these structural features,
which is sufficient to establish an association-in-fact enterprise under
current RICO jurisprudence.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the collaboration between Morgan Michelle Myers and Daniel
Kenneth Branthoover likely constitutes an association-in-fact enterprise
under RICO based on the provided materials, there are several caveats to
consider.
First, as noted in Klapper v. Commonwealth Realty Trust, 657 F.Supp. 948
(D. Del. 1987), "an 'association in fact' enterprise does not fall within the

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
RICO definition of a 'person,' since an 'association in fact' is not 'capable of
holding a legal or beneficial interest in property,' as required by 18 U.S.C. §
1961(3)." This means that while each participant (Morgan and Daniel) may
be a "person" liable under RICO, the association itself cannot be. This
distinction is important for understanding who or what can be held liable
under RICO.
Second, establishing an association-in-fact enterprise is only one element of
a RICO violation. As stated in "Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy" (2024-01-01),
a violation of § 1962(c) requires "(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through
a pattern (4) of racketeering activity." Therefore, even if Morgan and
Daniel's collaboration constitutes an association-in-fact enterprise, a RICO
violation would still require proof of a pattern of racketeering activity, which
depends on whether their actions qualify as predicate acts under RICO.
Third, while the broad interpretation of "enterprise" under RICO allows for
finding an association-in-fact enterprise in this case, it is important to note
that each RICO case is fact-specific. The strength of the evidence regarding
the common purpose, relationships, and longevity would be critical in
determining whether Morgan and Daniel's collaboration actually constitutes
an association-in-fact enterprise.
Fourth, as mentioned in Chambers v. King Buick GMC, LLC, 43 F. Supp. 3d
575 (D. Md. 2014), a RICO enterprise requires proof of three elements,
including that "the enterprise is an entity 'separate and apart from the
pattern of activity in which it engages.'" While Boyle v. United States, 556
U.S. 938 (2009) relaxed the requirement for a formal structure, there still
needs to be some distinction between the enterprise itself and the pattern of
racketeering activity. This distinction may be subtle in cases like this, where
the association exists primarily for allegedly illegitimate purposes.
Conclusion
Based on the statutory provisions and case law interpretation, the 17-month
collaboration between Morgan Michelle Myers and Daniel Kenneth
Branthoover with the common goal of preparing fraudulent documents to
influence Texas courts and remove Charles Dustin Myers from his home
likely constitutes an "association-in-fact" enterprise under RICO.
The collaboration satisfies the three structural features required for an
association-in-fact enterprise as established in United States v. Turkette, 452
U.S. 576 (1981) and further clarified in Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938
(2009): (1) a purpose, as evidenced by their common goal; (2) relationships
among associates, as demonstrated by their coordinated actions over an
extended period; and (3) longevity sufficient to permit these associates to
pursue the enterprise's purpose, as shown by the 17-month duration of their
collaboration.
The broad and inclusive definition of "enterprise" under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4),
coupled with the courts' consistent interpretation that an association-in-fact
enterprise does not require a formal legal structure or hierarchical
organization, supports the conclusion that Morgan and Daniel's

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
collaboration constitutes an enterprise under RICO. Their alleged actions, if
proven, represent precisely the type of coordinated criminal activity that
RICO was designed to address.
While establishing an association-in-fact enterprise is just one element of a
RICO violation, and a complete RICO case would require additional proof of
a pattern of racketeering activity through specific predicate acts, the
collaboration between Morgan and Daniel appears to satisfy the enterprise
requirement based on the provided materials. The courts have consistently
emphasized that RICO's terms should be "liberally construed to effectuate
its remedial purposes," and the broad interpretation of "enterprise" aligns
with this directive.
In conclusion, the collaboration between Morgan Michelle Myers and Daniel
Kenneth Branthoover, characterized by a common purpose, coordinated
actions, and sufficient longevity, likely constitutes an "association-in-fact"
enterprise under RICO as interpreted by the courts.

(N.D. Ohio Mar 29, 2013)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Ohio
Extract
An association-in-fact enterprise is 'a group of persons associated together
for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct.' United States v.
Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583 (1981). To show an association-in-fact, a plaintiff
must show '[an] ongoing organization, formal or informal, and... that the
various associates function as a continuing unit.' Id. More specifically, an
association-in-fact enterprise must have a structure bearing three features:
(1) 'a purpose,' (2) 'relationships among those associated with the
enterprise,' and (3) 'longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue
the enterprise's purpose.' Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 946 (2009).
Summary
Criteria for establishing an association-in-fact enterprise under RICO, as
defined by the U.S. Supreme Court in Turkette and Boyle. It specifies that
such an enterprise must have a common purpose, relationships among
associates, and sufficient longevity to pursue its purpose. These criteria
align with the proposition that Morgan and Daniel's collaboration over 17
months with a shared goal constitutes an association-in-fact enterprise.

Extract
Under RICO, two categories of associations can fulfill the 'enterprise'
requirement: legal entities (such as corporations and partnerships); and 'any
union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.'
18 U.S.C. § 1961(4). The latter is known as an 'association-in-fact' RICO
enterprise. The Supreme Court has described it as 'a group of persons
associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of
conduct.' United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69
L.Ed.2d 246 (1981). A RICO enterprise is characterized by 'continuity, unity,
shared purpose and identifiable structure.' United States v. Fiel, 35 F.3d
997, 1003 (4th Cir.1994) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).
Summary
Clear definition of what constitutes an "association-in-fact" enterprise under
RICO, emphasizing the need for a common purpose, continuity, unity, and
identifiable structure. It references the Supreme Court's description in
United States v. Turkette, which is directly relevant to the proposition. The
passage supports the idea that Morgan and Daniel's collaboration over 17
months with a shared goal could be considered an "association-in-fact"
enterprise under RICO.
Standard Chlorine of Delaware, Inc. v. Sinibaldi, 821 F.Supp. 232 (D. Del.
1992)
U.S. District Court — District of Delaware
Extract
The essential elements of a civil RICO claim are '(1) the existence of a RICO
`enterprise'; (2) the existence of `a pattern of racketeering activity'; (3) a
nexus between the defendant, the pattern of racketeering activity or the
RICO `enterprise'; and (4) resulting injury to plaintiff, in his business or
property.' Klapper v. Commonwealth Realty Trust, 657 F.Supp. 948, 953
(D.Del.1987). In addition, to establish the existence of a RICO enterprise, a
plaintiff must demonstrate that (1) the enterprise is an ongoing
organization, with some form of structure which is used in making and

Summary
Essential elements required to establish a RICO enterprise, which includes
the existence of an ongoing organization with a structure for decision-
making, members functioning as a continuing unit, and an existence
separate from the pattern of racketeering activity. This supports the
proposition that Morgan and Daniel's collaboration over a 17-month period,
with a common goal and coordinated actions, could constitute an
"association-in-fact" enterprise under RICO.
U.S. v. Battle, 473 F.Supp.2d 1185 (S.D. Fla. 2006)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Florida
Extract
An analysis of the issue must begin with the definition of 'enterprise' under
the RICO statute. For RICO purposes, an 'enterprise' '[i]ncludes any
individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and
any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal
entity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4). In United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 101
S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981), the United States Supreme Court stated:
'The enterprise is an entity, for present purposes a group of persons
associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of
conduct .... [This element] is proved by evidence of an on going organization,
formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a
continuing unit.'
Summary
The definition of an "enterprise" under RICO includes any group of
individuals associated in fact, even if not a legal entity, as long as they have
a common purpose and function as a continuing unit. The passage
references the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Turkette, which
supports the idea that an informal association with a common goal can
constitute an enterprise under RICO. This aligns with the proposition that
Morgan and Daniel's collaboration over 17 months with a shared goal could
be considered an "association-in-fact" enterprise.

(quoting 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4) ) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Accordingly, a RICO enterprise can be either a legal entity or an association-
in-fact... When the alleged enterprise is an association-in-fact enterprise, the
plaintiff must show evidence of: (1) an existence separate and apart from the
pattern of racketeering; (2) ongoing organization; and (3) members that
function as a continuing unit as shown by a hierarchical or consensual,
decision-making structure... An association-in-fact enterprise is simply a
continuing unit that functions with a common purpose and course of
conduct. Boyle, 556 U.S. at 950, 129 S.Ct. 2237. Although each member of
the enterprise must also share this common purpose, Michael Kent
Plambeck, 2014 WL 1303000, at *3, the enterprise concept is broad. Boyle,
556 U.S. at 949, 129 S.Ct. 2237. An association need not have a 'hierarchical
structure,' a 'chain of command,' or any formalized procedures. Id. at 948,
129 S.Ct. 2237.
Summary
Requirements for such an enterprise, including a common purpose and
functioning as a continuing unit. The collaboration between Morgan and
Daniel, with a shared goal and coordinated actions over an extended period,
aligns with these requirements, supporting the proposition that their actions
constitute an "association-in-fact" enterprise under RICO.

A RICO enterprise is defined as 'any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4). ... An
association-in-fact enterprise means 'a group of persons associated together

Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981). This
type of RICO enterprise 'must have at least three structural features: [1] a
purpose, [2] relationships among those associated with the enterprise, and
[3] longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the enterprise's
purpose.' Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 946, 129 S.Ct. 2237, 173

U.S. District Court — District of Maryland
Extract
There may be multiple persons whose association with the same RICO
enterprise gives rise to multiple violations of Section 1962(c). “Enterprise,”
as set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4), “includes any individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.” A RICO enterprise
is characterized by “ ‘continuity, unity, shared purpose and identifiable
structure.’ ” United States v. Fiel, 35 F.3d 997, 1003 (4th Cir.1994) (citation
omitted). An “enterprise” requires proof of three elements: (1) an ongoing
organization; (2) associates functioning as a continuing unit; and (3) the
enterprise is an entity “separate and apart from the pattern of activity in
which it engages.” ... An association-in-fact enterprise is not defined by a
formal legal structure, but is instead characterized by the association of its
members “for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct.”
United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246

Summary
Characteristics of a RICO enterprise, including continuity, unity, shared
purpose, and identifiable structure. It also emphasizes that an association-
in-fact enterprise is characterized by the association of its members for a
common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct. This directly supports
the proposition that Morgan Michelle Myers and Daniel Kenneth
Branthoover's collaboration over a 17-month period with a shared goal and
coordinated actions could constitute an "association-in-fact" enterprise
under RICO.

69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981), the Supreme Court recognized that '[t]here is no
restriction upon the associations embraced by the definition: an enterprise
includes any union or group of individuals associated in fact,' including both
legitimate ventures and wholly criminal organizations.
Summary
RICO's definition of an "enterprise" is broad and includes any group of
individuals associated in fact, even if not a legal entity. This aligns with the
proposition that Morgan and Daniel's collaboration, with a shared goal and
coordinated actions, can be considered an "association-in-fact" enterprise
under RICO. The passage supports the idea that such an enterprise can be
formed for both legitimate and criminal purposes, which is relevant to the
alleged fraudulent activities.
United States v. Kelly, 609 F.Supp.3d 85 (E.D. N.Y. 2022)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of New York
Extract
The RICO statute makes it unlawful for 'any person employed by or
associated with any enterprise' whose activities affect interstate or foreign
commerce 'to conduct or participate ... in the conduct of such enterprise's
affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). The
statute further defines 'enterprise' to include 'any ... group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4). As the
Supreme Court has observed, the 'enumeration of included enterprises is
obviously broad,' and 'the term ‘any’ ensures that the definition has a wide
reach.' Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 944, 129 S.Ct. 2237, 173 L.Ed.

structural features: a purpose, relationships among those associated with
the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue
the enterprise's purpose.' Boyle, 556 U.S. at 946, 129 S.Ct. 2237. An
association-in-fact enterprise is 'a group of persons associated together for a
common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct.' United States v.
Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981) ; United

enterprise is simply a continuing unit that functions with a common
purpose.' (quoting Boyle, 556 U.S. at 948, 129 S.Ct. 2237 )).
Summary
The passage explains that under RICO, an "enterprise" can include any
group of individuals associated in fact, even if not a legal entity, as long as
they have a common purpose and function as a continuing unit. This aligns

A RICO 'enterprise' is defined as 'any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4). Since
Sedima, this circuit has emphasized its requirement of 'continuity plus
relationship' with respect to the RICO enterprise, defining it as a 'group
associated `for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct' which
'is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by
evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit.'
Summary
A RICO enterprise can be any group of individuals associated in fact, even if
not a legal entity, as long as they have a common purpose and function as a
continuing unit. The passage emphasizes the requirement of "continuity plus

Summary
An "association-in-fact" enterprise under RICO does not require a formal
legal entity but can be any group of individuals associated for a common
purpose and functioning as a continuing unit. The passage cites Supreme
Court cases that define the structural features necessary for such an
enterprise, which include a purpose, relationships among associates, and
longevity. This aligns with the proposition that Morgan and Daniel's
collaboration over 17 months with a shared goal could constitute an
"association-in-fact" enterprise under RICO.

The passage from United States v. Denava emphasizes that a RICO
enterprise can be established with evidence of an ongoing organization,
whether formal or informal, and that the associates function as a continuing
unit. This aligns with the proposition that Morgan and Daniel's collaboration
over 17 months with a common goal can constitute an "association-in-fact"
enterprise under RICO. The passage supports the idea that the lack of a
formal legal entity does not preclude the existence of a RICO enterprise, as
long as there is a common purpose and coordinated actions.

corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' 18 U.S.C. §
1961(4). Thus, an 'association-in-fact' RICO enterprise requires three
features: 'a purpose, relationships among those associated with the
enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the
enterprise's purpose.' Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 946 (2009)
('[T]he very concept of an association in fact is expansive[,] in keeping with
RICO's directive that 'its terms are to be liberally construed to effectuate its

Summary
The passage defines an "enterprise" under RICO as including any group of
individuals associated in fact, even if not a legal entity. It specifies that an
association-in-fact requires a purpose, relationships among those involved,
and sufficient longevity to pursue the enterprise's purpose. This aligns with
the proposition that Morgan and Daniel's collaboration over 17 months with
a common goal constitutes an association-in-fact enterprise under RICO.
Reynolds v. Condon, 908 F.Supp. 1494 (N.D. W.Va. 1996)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of West Virginia
Extract
The court concludes here that there is no requirement that the common or
shared purpose of the 'RICO enterprise' in fact be the criminal or injurious
scheme of which the plaintiff complains, or even that the common or shared
purpose be illegal activity aimed at this or other victims; the enterprise need
only have a common or shared purpose, which may be legal or otherwise,
and may be related to the predicate acts or not, as the case may be, as well
as the other organizational characteristics of an enterprise, continuity of
structure and structure distinct from that inherent in a pattern of
racketeering activity...
Summary
A RICO enterprise does not necessarily need to have an illegal or injurious
purpose. It only needs a common or shared purpose, which can be legal or
otherwise, and must exhibit organizational characteristics such as continuity
of structure. This supports the proposition that Morgan and Daniel's
collaboration, with a shared goal and coordinated actions over an extended
period, could constitute an "association-in-fact" enterprise under RICO, even
if their shared purpose was not explicitly illegal.

Klapper v. Commonwealth Realty Trust, 657 F.Supp. 948 (D. Del. 1987)
U.S. District Court — District of Delaware
Extract
The rationale for this holding is the Seventh Circuit's discussion of the
relationship between an 'association in fact' and a 'person' under the
statute. That court stated that an 'association in fact' enterprise does not fall
within the RICO definition of a 'person,' since an 'association in fact' is not
'capable of holding a legal or beneficial interest in property,' as required by
18 U.S.C. § 1961(3). Thus, 'in the association in fact situation, each
participant in the enterprise may be a `person' liable under RICO, but the
association itself cannot be.' Haroco v. American National Bank & Trust Co.,
747 F.2d at 401.
Summary
An "association-in-fact" under RICO does not need to be a formal legal entity
capable of holding property. Instead, it can consist of individuals who
collaborate with a common purpose. This supports the proposition that
Morgan and Daniel's collaboration over 17 months with a shared goal can be
considered an "association-in-fact" enterprise under RICO.

unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise
engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce,

enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of
unlawful debt. It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any
of the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section.
Summary
The statute makes it unlawful to engage in or conspire to engage in a
pattern of racketeering activity to acquire or maintain control of an
enterprise. This aligns with the proposition that Morgan and Daniel's
collaboration over a 17-month period, with the goal of preparing fraudulent
documents, could be considered a pattern of racketeering activity. The
statute also supports the idea that an "association-in-fact" enterprise can
exist without being a formal legal entity, as long as it has a common purpose
and functions as a continuing unit.

RICO - the rejection of an economic motive requirement.
Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology - Northwestern University,
School of Law - Randolph, Jennifer G. - 1995-03-22
Extract
RICO requires that the enterprise have an economic motive, the Court
defined enterprise as 'an entity,... a group of persons associated together for
a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct,' which does not
require an economic motive. Thus, the Court established precedent for a
liberal reading of RICO, and specifically the term 'enterprise.' ... The
Turkette Court defined enterprise as 'an entity, for present purposes a group
of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a
course of conduct.'
Summary
The Supreme Court, in United States v. Turkette, defined an "enterprise"
under RICO as a group of individuals associated together for a common
purpose of engaging in a course of conduct, without requiring an economic
motive. This broad interpretation supports the idea that Morgan and
Daniel's collaboration, with a shared goal and coordinated actions, could
constitute an "association-in-fact" enterprise under RICO.

and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal
entity.” This language is expansive; the word “includes” renders the
statutory list illustrative, not exhaustive. See, e.g., Boyle v. United States,
556 U.S. 938, 944 & n.2 (2009) (“The statute does not specifically define the
outer boundaries of the ‘enterprise’ concept but states that the term
‘includes any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal
entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not
a legal entity.’ . . . This provision does not purport to set out an exhaustive
definition of the term ‘enterprise.’”); United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576
(1981), the Supreme Court ruled that the term “enterprise” encompasses
both legitimate and illegitimate organizations without distinction. The
Turkette Court also identified three characteristics of any RICO enterprise.
An enterprise, it declared, “is proved [first] by evidence of an ongoing
organization, formal or informal, and [second] by evidence that the various
associates function as a continuing unit.”
Summary
The passage from the guide explains that an "enterprise" under RICO can
include any group of individuals associated in fact, even if not a legal entity,
as long as they have a common purpose and function as a continuing unit.
The Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Turkette supports this
interpretation by stating that an enterprise can be both legitimate and
illegitimate and must be evidenced by an ongoing organization and
associates functioning as a continuing unit. This aligns with the proposition
that Morgan and Daniel's collaboration over 17 months with a shared goal
constitutes an "association-in-fact" enterprise under RICO.

any type of association can satisfy the enterprise element as long as it meets
this definition. (111) As a result, courts have found a broad array of groups

An association-in-fact under RICO does not require a formal structure
beyond the pattern of racketeering activity. The Supreme Court has clarified
that any group with a shared purpose, continuity, and unity can be
considered an association-in-fact. This supports the proposition that Morgan
and Daniel's collaboration over 17 months with a common goal can be seen
as an association-in-fact enterprise under RICO.

Extract
An enterprise includes any individual, partnership, corporation, association,
or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity... In this case the plaintiff asserts that the
enterprise is an association in fact instead of a structured organization, and
that the enterprise is composed of [describe components of alleged
association-in-fact]. I instruct you that such an association-in-fact may be
considered an enterprise, provided that it is a group of persons associated
for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct, and has at least
three structural features: (a) a purpose, (b) relationships among those
associated with the enterprise, and (c) longevity sufficient to permit these
associations to pursue the
Summary
Such an association must have a common purpose, relationships among its
members, and sufficient longevity to pursue its objectives. This aligns with
the proposition that Morgan and Daniel's collaboration over 17 months with
a shared goal constitutes an "association-in-fact" enterprise under RICO.

Informal relationships among entities may suffice to create an 'associated-in-
fact' enterprises. (95) The grouping of entities may be a legal or illegal
association. (96) In order to be an association-in-fact, the grouping must
have a shared purpose, continuity, and unity. (97) ... Recently, in Boyle v.
United States, (100) the Supreme Court clarified that RICO association-in-

fact enterprises need not have 'an ascertainable structure beyond that
inherent in the pattern of racketeering activity.' (101) ... According to the
Supreme Court, any type of association can satisfy the enterprise element as
long as it meets this definition. (111)
Summary
An "association-in-fact" under RICO can be formed by informal relationships
among individuals or entities, as long as they have a shared purpose,
continuity, and unity. The Supreme Court has clarified that such enterprises
do not need a formal structure beyond the pattern of racketeering activity.
This supports the proposition that Morgan and Daniel's collaboration, with a
shared goal and coordinated actions, could constitute an "association-in-
fact" enterprise under RICO.

An 'enterprise' includes 'any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity.' (68) It is immaterial whether
the defendant has a stake in the operation of the enterprise because
individuals outside of a business may assist the business in attaining its
illegal goals. (69)... A RICO enterprise need not be part of a formal
relationship. (85) A combination of different entities can constitute an
enterprise within the meaning of RICO, (86)... In order to be an association-
in-fact, the association must have a shared purpose, continuity, unity, an
identifiable structure, (88) and some goals separate from the predicate acts
themselves. (89)
Summary
Broad interpretation of what constitutes an "enterprise" under RICO,
emphasizing that it can include any group of individuals associated in fact,
even if not a formal legal entity. It highlights that the enterprise must have a
shared purpose, continuity, unity, and an identifiable structure. This aligns
with the proposition that Morgan and Daniel's collaboration over 17 months
with a common goal could be considered an "association-in-fact" enterprise
under RICO.

Extract
An 'enterprise' includes 'any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity.' ... For RICO purposes, an
enterprise must exist independently from the racketeering activity in which
it engages, its groups must have a common or shared purpose, and there
must be at least some continuity of structure or personnel. ... In order to be
an association-in-fact, the association must have a shared purpose,
continuity, unity, an identifiable structure, and some goals separate from the
predicate acts themselves.
Summary
The group must have a shared purpose, continuity, unity, and an identifiable
structure, which aligns with the proposition that Morgan and Daniel's
collaboration over 17 months with a shared goal constitutes an "association-
in-fact" enterprise.

Extract
An 'enterprise' includes 'any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity.' (75) A defendant need not
have a stake in the operation of the enterprise but instead may be an
individual outside of the enterprise who assists the enterprise in attaining its
illegal goals. (76)... When the enterprise is an association-in-fact without a
legal existence, the government must make the more difficult showing that
the constituent entities 'associated together for a common purpose of
engaging in a course of conduct.' (107) According to the Supreme Court, any
type of association can satisfy the enterprise element as long as it meets this
definition. (108)
Summary
An "enterprise" under RICO can include any group of individuals associated
in fact, even if not a legal entity, as long as they share a common purpose
and engage in a course of conduct. The passage also clarifies that
individuals outside the enterprise can assist in achieving its illegal goals.
This supports the proposition that Morgan and Daniel's collaboration over
17 months, with a shared goal and coordinated actions, could constitute an
"association-in-fact" enterprise under RICO.

Extract
The plaintiff must next demonstrate the existence of an 'enterprise.' There is
no requirement that the enterprise be criminal in character; the enterprise
may be a legitimate business, such as a bank or a bank holding company.
Indeed, even the office of state governor has been found to be an enterprise
subject to RICO. Nor must the enterprise be formally organized; it may be
an 'association-in-fact.' The enterprise may be the perpetrator, instrument,
victim or prize of the fraud. The enterprise must be distinguished from the
pattern of racketeering activity. Notwithstanding, the same evidence may be
used to establish both the pattern and the existence of the enterprise.

Summary
An enterprise under RICO does not need to be a formal legal entity or
criminal in nature. It can be any group of individuals associated in fact with
a common purpose. This supports the proposition that Morgan and Daniel's
collaboration over 17 months with a shared goal can be considered an
"association-in-fact" enterprise under RICO.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded... Section 1961(4) defines “enterprise” as
“any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity,
and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal
entity.”
Summary
Essential elements required to establish a RICO violation under § 1962(c),
including the need for an "enterprise," which can be a group of individuals
associated in fact, even if not a legal entity. This supports the proposition
that Morgan and Daniel's collaboration could constitute an "association-in-
fact" enterprise under RICO, as they had a common purpose and
coordinated actions over an extended period.
Corporate Criminal Liability: End It, Don't Mend It.
The Journal of Corporation Law - University of Iowa Journal of
Corporation Law - Smith, Stephen F. - 2022-06-22
Extract
Subsection 1962(c), the most commonly used basis for substantive RICO
charges, is instructive. It imposes civil and criminal liability on the persons
'employed by or associated with' organized-crime syndicates or other RICO
'enterprises' who 'conduct, or participate in the conduct of, the [enterprise's]
affairs' through a 'pattern of racketeering activity.' ... Although it was
originally quite doubtful that purely criminal organizations could constitute
RICO enterprises, the Supreme Court has long endorsed that expansive
interpretation, which breathed new life into RICO by allowing prosecutors to
go directly after organized criminals without awaiting efforts to infiltrate

legitimate businesses. See United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 587
(1981) (holding that purely illegitimate groups can constitute RICO
enterprises).
Summary
The passage explains that RICO can apply to individuals associated with
enterprises that conduct affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. It
highlights the Supreme Court's interpretation in United States v. Turkette,
which allows for purely illegitimate groups to be considered RICO
enterprises. This supports the proposition that Morgan and Daniel's
collaboration, with a common goal and coordinated actions, could be seen as
an "association-in-fact" enterprise under RICO.
Insurance Fraud is a Violent Crime.
Insurance Advocate - CINN Group, Inc. - 2024-03-01
Extract
RICO conspiracy was established by proof of: (a) of an agreement to join a
racketeering scheme, (b) of the defendant's knowing engagement in the
scheme with the intent that its overall goals be effectuated, and (c) that the
scheme involved, or by agreement between any members of the conspiracy
was intended to involve, two or more predicate acts of racketeering.
Summary
Elements necessary to establish a RICO conspiracy, which includes an
agreement to join a racketeering scheme, knowing engagement with intent
to effectuate the scheme's goals, and involvement in two or more predicate
acts of racketeering. This directly supports the proposition that Morgan and
Daniel's collaboration over 17 months, with a shared goal and coordinated
actions, could constitute an "association-in-fact" enterprise under RICO, as it
suggests they may have engaged in a racketeering scheme with the intent to
achieve its goals.
RECONCEIVING COERCION-BASED CRIMINAL DEFENSES.
Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology - Northwestern University,
School of Law - Galoob, Stephen R. - 2022-03-22
Extract
The inquiry here is meant to invoke the 'pattern of racketeering activity'
element of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
The Organized Crime Control Act (1970), which includes RICO, provides that
'criminal conduct forms a pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the

=== PAGE 30 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events.' The Supreme Court characterized this
requirement as a 'relationship' element and held that the statute further
requires a 'continuity' element, 'referring either to a closed period of
repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition.'
Summary
For an enterprise to be considered under RICO, there must be a pattern of
racketeering activity, which includes a relationship and continuity element.
The relationship element requires that the criminal acts have similar
purposes, results, participants, or methods, while the continuity element
requires repeated conduct over a period or conduct that threatens future
repetition. The collaboration between Morgan and Daniel over 17 months
with a common goal fits these criteria, as it involves repeated and
coordinated actions with a shared purpose.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
A RICO enterprise includes 'any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity.' Courts have interpreted
'enterprise' broadly, and the definition captures both legitimate and
illegitimate enterprises. The statutory list is not exhaustive but merely
illustrative.
Summary
The definition of a RICO enterprise is broad and includes any group of
individuals associated in fact, even if not a legal entity. This supports the
proposition that Morgan and Daniel's collaboration over a 17-month period
with a common goal can be considered an "association-in-fact" enterprise
under RICO. The passage emphasizes that both legitimate and illegitimate
enterprises can fall under this definition, which aligns with the alleged
fraudulent activities in the proposition.
