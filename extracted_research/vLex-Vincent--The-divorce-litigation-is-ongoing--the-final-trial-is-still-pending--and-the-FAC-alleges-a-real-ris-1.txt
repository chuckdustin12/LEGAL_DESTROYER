Question
The divorce litigation is ongoing, the final trial is still pending, and the FAC
alleges a real risk of further predicate acts as the case proceeds. Open-
ended continuity may be established where the enterprise’s objective is
unfulfilled and there is a real threat of further predicate acts (Tal v. Hogan,
453 F.3d 1244, 1267 (10th Cir. 2006); Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF
Constr., Inc., No. 10-cv-0635 RB/SMV (D. N.M. Mar 27, 2013)). Because the
litigation is ongoing and the enterprise’s broader goal has not been
achieved, the risk of further predicate acts is not speculative but grounded
in the facts, supporting a plausible claim of open-ended continuity. 
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Open-ended continuity under RICO can be established where ongoing
litigation presents a real and non-speculative threat of further predicate
acts, particularly when the enterprise’s objective remains unfulfilled. The
ongoing nature of the divorce litigation and the factual allegations of
continued risk support a plausible claim of open-ended continuity.
Summary
The legal standard for establishing a "pattern of racketeering activity" under
RICO requires not only multiple predicate acts but also a demonstration of
continuity, which can be either closed-ended (over a substantial period) or
open-ended (a threat of future repetition). In the context of ongoing
litigation where the enterprise’s broader goal has not yet been achieved and
there is a real risk of further predicate acts, courts recognize that open-
ended continuity may be satisfied, making the threat of continued
racketeering activity more than merely speculative.
Case law and secondary authorities consistently hold that open-ended
continuity is present when the facts show a genuine risk that racketeering
activity will continue into the future, especially where the enterprise’s
objectives are ongoing or unfulfilled. The ongoing divorce litigation, coupled
with allegations of a real risk of further predicate acts, aligns with this
standard and supports the plausibility of a RICO claim based on open-ended
continuity.
Background and Relevant Law
The RICO Continuity Requirement
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) requires a
plaintiff to establish a "pattern of racketeering activity," which involves at

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
least two predicate acts and, crucially, a showing of continuity. The Supreme
Court, as well as the Tenth Circuit and district courts within its jurisdiction,
have clarified that continuity can be demonstrated in two ways: closed-
ended continuity (a series of related predicates over a substantial period)
and open-ended continuity (conduct that, by its nature, poses a threat of
continuing into the future).
The leading Supreme Court authority, as cited in multiple cases and
secondary sources, defines continuity as either a closed period of repeated
conduct or past conduct that projects into the future with a threat of
repetition. The open-ended form is particularly relevant where the
enterprise’s objective is ongoing or unfulfilled, and the facts suggest a real
threat of further predicate acts.
Case Law
Taylor v. Chesapeake Operating, Inc.
In Taylor v. Chesapeake Operating, Inc., Case No. CIV-18-565-D (W.D. Okla.
Nov 20, 2019), the court, relying on Tenth Circuit and Supreme Court
precedent, emphasized that to satisfy RICO’s pattern requirement, a plaintiff
must show not only multiple predicate acts but also that these acts
constitute a threat of continuing racketeering activity. The court explained
that continuity is both a closed- and open-ended concept, with open-ended
continuity referring to conduct that projects into the future with a threat of
repetition. The court further noted that the showing required for continuity
is more demanding than for relatedness, and that continuity plus
relationship is necessary to establish a pattern.
Schrag v. Dinges
Schrag v. Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543 (D. Kan. 1992) similarly interprets the
Supreme Court’s guidance, stating that predicate acts must either amount
to or pose a threat of continuing racketeering activity. The court reiterated
that open-ended continuity can be established by showing that the predicate
acts are a regular way of conducting the enterprise’s ongoing business, and
that even conduct over a short period may satisfy the continuity element if
there is a threat of future repetition.
Levey v. Wetherall
In Levey v. Wetherall, Civil Action No. 1:19-cv-02294-DDD-MEH (D. Colo.
Sep 29, 2020), the court outlined the elements of a civil RICO claim,
including the requirement that predicate acts extend over a substantial
period or otherwise pose a threat of continued activity. The court cited Tal v.
Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244 (10th Cir. 2006), which is directly referenced in the
user’s question, for the proposition that ongoing objectives and the risk of
further predicate acts can support open-ended continuity.

Secondary Materials
Multiple secondary sources, including RICO primers and legal
commentaries, reinforce the judicial interpretation of open-ended continuity.
These sources explain that open-ended continuity is satisfied where the
predicate acts pose a threat of continuing criminal activity extending
indefinitely into the future, particularly in light of the nature of the
enterprise and the facts alleged. They also emphasize that the determination
of a threat of continued racketeering activity is inherently fact-specific and
must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.
Analysis
Application to Ongoing Divorce Litigation
The scenario presented involves ongoing divorce litigation, with the final
trial still pending and the First Amended Complaint (FAC) alleging a real
risk of further predicate acts as the case proceeds. The question is whether
these facts support a plausible claim of open-ended continuity under RICO.
1. The Standard for Open-Ended Continuity
The authorities make clear that open-ended continuity does not require a
long history of predicate acts; rather, it is sufficient if the facts show a real
threat that such acts will continue into the future. This is particularly true
where the enterprise’s objective is ongoing or unfulfilled, and the conduct
alleged is a regular way of conducting the enterprise’s business (Schrag v.
Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543 (D. Kan. 1992); Taylor v. Chesapeake Operating,
Inc., Case No. CIV-18-565-D (W.D. Okla. Nov 20, 2019)).
Secondary materials further clarify that open-ended continuity is present
where the threat of continued criminal activity is not merely speculative but
grounded in the facts, such as when the enterprise’s broader goal has not
yet been achieved and the conduct at issue is likely to recur as part of the
ongoing enterprise (RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31)).
2. Ongoing Litigation and Unfulfilled Objectives
The ongoing nature of the divorce litigation is significant. Courts have
recognized that when litigation is still pending and the enterprise’s objective
remains unfulfilled, the risk of further predicate acts is not hypothetical.
Instead, the facts support a real and continuing threat, especially if the
alleged racketeering activity is tied to the litigation process itself or to the
pursuit of the enterprise’s goals through the litigation (Levey v. Wetherall,
Civil Action No. 1:19-cv-02294-DDD-MEH (D. Colo. Sep 29, 2020); Schrag v.
Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543 (D. Kan. 1992)).
The Supreme Court and lower courts have repeatedly stated that the
existence of a threat of continued racketeering activity is a function of the
particular facts of each case. Where the facts show that the enterprise’s

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
broader goal has not been achieved and that further predicate acts are likely
as the litigation continues, open-ended continuity is established (Racketeer
influenced and corrupt organizations (2011-03-22); RICO: A Primer
(2022-01-31)).
3. The Real Risk of Further Predicate Acts
The FAC’s allegations of a real risk of further predicate acts as the litigation
proceeds are critical. Courts have held that where the threat of continued
racketeering activity is grounded in the facts—such as ongoing litigation
with unresolved objectives—open-ended continuity is present. This is
distinguished from cases where the risk is merely speculative or where the
enterprise’s objective has already been achieved, in which case the threat of
future acts may be too remote (Schrag v. Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543 (D. Kan.
1992); RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31)).
4. Case-by-Case Assessment
The authorities uniformly emphasize that the determination of open-ended
continuity is fact-specific. The courts must examine whether the facts, taken
as true at the pleading stage, support a plausible inference that the threat of
continued racketeering activity exists. In the context of ongoing litigation
with unfulfilled objectives and specific allegations of a real risk of further
predicate acts, the standard for open-ended continuity is met (Racketeer
influenced and corrupt organizations (2011-03-22); Schrag v. Dinges, 788
F.Supp. 1543 (D. Kan. 1992)).
Synthesis of Authorities
The combined weight of the case law and secondary materials supports the
proposition that ongoing litigation, where the enterprise’s objective is
unfulfilled and there is a real risk of further predicate acts, satisfies the
open-ended continuity requirement under RICO. The courts have
consistently held that the threat of continued racketeering activity, when
grounded in the facts and not merely speculative, is sufficient to establish a
pattern of racketeering activity.
The authorities also make clear that the mere fact that the predicate acts
have occurred over a short period does not preclude a finding of open-ended
continuity, provided that the threat of future acts is real and ongoing. This is
particularly true in cases where the enterprise’s broader goal has not yet
been achieved and the conduct at issue is likely to recur as part of the
ongoing enterprise (Schrag v. Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543 (D. Kan. 1992); 
RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31)).

Exceptions and Caveats
While the authorities support the proposition that ongoing litigation with
unfulfilled objectives and a real risk of further predicate acts can establish
open-ended continuity, there are important caveats:
Speculative Risk Insufficient: If the risk of further predicate acts is
merely speculative or hypothetical, courts may find that open-ended
continuity is not established. The allegations must be grounded in
specific facts that make the threat of continued racketeering activity
plausible (Schrag v. Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543 (D. Kan. 1992)).
Single Scheme Limitation: Some courts have been cautious about
finding open-ended continuity where the alleged racketeering activity is
part of a single, discrete scheme with a clear endpoint. However, where
the scheme is ongoing and the enterprise’s objective remains
unfulfilled, this limitation is less likely to apply (The resurrection of the
'single scheme' exclusion to RICO's pattern requirement (2013-04-01)).
Case-by-Case Analysis: The determination of open-ended continuity is
inherently fact-specific. Courts will examine the particular facts alleged
in the complaint to determine whether the threat of continued
racketeering activity is real and ongoing (Racketeer influenced and
corrupt organizations (2011-03-22)).
Multiple Victims and Goals: Some courts have suggested that the
pattern requirement is more easily satisfied where the predicate acts
affect multiple victims or aim to accomplish more than one discrete
goal (Levey v. Wetherall, Civil Action No. 1:19-cv-02294-DDD-MEH (D.
Colo. Sep 29, 2020)). However, this is not a strict requirement for open-
ended continuity, especially where the risk of future acts is real.
Conclusion
In sum, the authorities provided support the conclusion that open-ended
continuity under RICO can be established where ongoing litigation presents
a real and non-speculative threat of further predicate acts, particularly when
the enterprise’s objective remains unfulfilled. The ongoing nature of the
divorce litigation, combined with factual allegations of a real risk of
continued racketeering activity, satisfies the standard for open-ended
continuity. Courts will assess the plausibility of such claims on a case-by-
case basis, but the legal framework and precedents cited above strongly
support the proposition that the risk of further predicate acts in this context
is not speculative but grounded in the facts, making a RICO claim based on
open-ended continuity plausible.

Summary
Requirements for establishing a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO,
emphasizing the need for continuity and the threat of ongoing activity. It
references the concept of open-ended continuity, which is relevant to the
proposition that ongoing litigation and unfulfilled objectives can support a
claim of continued predicate acts. The passage aligns with the proposition
by highlighting the necessity of demonstrating a threat of continued activity,
which is central to the argument that ongoing litigation poses a real risk of
further predicate acts.

U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
With respect to the 'continuity' requirement, the Supreme Court stated that
the predicate acts must amount to, or pose a threat of, continuing
racketeering activity. According to the Supreme Court, continuity 'is both a
closed- and open-ended concept, referring to a closed period of repeated
conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a
threat of repetition.' Predicates extending over merely a few weeks or
months, on the other hand, may satisfy the continuity element if there is a
threat of repetition in the future. This latter concept of continuity, which
occurs over an 'open period,' is established by showing that the predicate
acts are a 'regular way of conducting the enterprise's ongoing business.'
Summary
The concept of continuity in RICO cases can be both closed and open-ended.
The open-ended continuity is particularly relevant here, as it involves past
conduct that projects into the future with a threat of repetition. This aligns
with the proposition that ongoing litigation and the risk of further predicate
acts can establish open-ended continuity, especially when the enterprise's
broader goal remains unfulfilled.

Open-ended continuity, on the other hand, could be present before closed-
ended continuity could be established. Whether open-ended continuity exists
'depends on the specific facts of each case,' the Court explained. 'Without
making any claim to cover the field of possibilities,' the Court presented
three examples of how this 'open-ended continuity' could be proven: (1) 'if
the related predicates themselves involve a distinct threat of long-term
racketeering activity, either implicit or explicit;' (2) if the predicate acts are
part of the 'regular way of doing business' of a 'long-term association that
exists for criminal purposes;' or (3) if the predicates are 'a regular way of
conducting the defendant's ongoing legitimate business' or RICO enterprise.

The 'continuity' prong is satisfied by proof of either closed-ended continuity
or open-ended continuity. Closed-ended continuity in the RICO context may
be demonstrated 'by proving a series of related predicates extending over a
substantial period of time.' Open-ended continuity in the RICO context is
conduct that may last only a short period of time but nonetheless poses a
threat of extending into the future. The Court suggested a case-by-case
examination of this issue, noting that the existence of a 'threat of continued
racketeering activity' is a function of particular facts.
