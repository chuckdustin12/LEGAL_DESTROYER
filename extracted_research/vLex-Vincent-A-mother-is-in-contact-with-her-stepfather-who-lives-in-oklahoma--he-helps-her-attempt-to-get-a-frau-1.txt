Question
A mother is in contact with her stepfather who lives in oklahoma, he helps
her attempt to get a fraudulent ex-parte order against her husband in texas,
and when that fails, they devise a scheme. The stepfather in oklahoma
contacts the father, and says "i want to help you" and convinces him to let
his wife visit his residency in oklahoma. After he agrees, the stepfather helps
the mother empty the joint marital bank account in to his paypal, which
happened across state lines. Then, she drives to his house with the intent to
receive help in filing a fraudulent divorce petition, and a false affidavit of
indigency and claims of abuse, and gets a second phone. She then contacts
her other grandfather in houston, and requests a new car while also
claiming financial responsibility for the current two cars, then she influences
her grandmother next door to serve father an eviction notice while she's in
oklahoma, and the eviction cites a divorce and protective order that hadnt
been filed yet. The scheme has a common purpose to have the father
removed from his home, which is also his busines, and this plan works. The
court orders the father out of his home, and the mother continues the
fraudulent scheme by getting an attorney who adds to the fraud by serving
the father a settlement agreement that he did not consent to, which became
rendered anyway. how doesthis affect the divorce court's jurisdiction?
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
The fraudulent scheme does not eliminate the divorce court's jurisdiction,
but it may provide grounds for the court to decline jurisdiction or for the
father to challenge the proceedings based on the unjustifiable conduct
doctrine and potentially seek remedies through other legal channels.
Summary
The fraudulent scheme described involves multiple parties engaging in
deceptive practices across state lines to manipulate divorce proceedings and
remove the father from his home in Texas. While state courts generally
maintain jurisdiction over divorce matters under the domestic relations
exception to federal jurisdiction, the fraudulent conduct may impact how
that jurisdiction is exercised.
The courts may consider declining jurisdiction based on unjustifiable
conduct under principles similar to those found in the Uniform Child
Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA). Additionally, while the
divorce proceedings themselves remain within state court jurisdiction, the
interstate nature of the fraud could potentially give rise to separate federal
claims under wire fraud statutes or RICO, though these would be
adjudicated separately from the divorce itself. The father may have grounds
to challenge the divorce court's decisions based on the fraudulent scheme,

though the divorce court's fundamental jurisdiction over the dissolution of
marriage likely remains intact.
Background and Relevant Legal Framework
Domestic Relations Exception to Federal Jurisdiction
At the outset, it is important to note that divorce proceedings generally fall
under state court jurisdiction rather than federal jurisdiction. This is known
as the domestic relations exception to federal jurisdiction. As established in 
Merritt v. Grady, 23-cv-16243 (N.D. Ill. Jul 30, 2024), "under the domestic-
relations exception to federal jurisdiction, divorce, alimony, and child-
custody decrees, are considered outside of federal jurisdictional bounds."
The court further explained that "[t]he domestic-relations exception stems
from the Supreme Court's long-held understanding that the subject of
domestic relations belongs to the laws of the States."
Similarly, in Haynes v. Bass, NO. 6:18-CV-06086 (W.D. Ark. Dec 19, 2019),
the court stated that "[t]he domestic relations exception divests federal
courts of jurisdiction over the issuance of a divorce, alimony, or child
custody decree." This reinforces the principle that divorce proceedings
should be handled by state courts rather than federal courts.
Fraudulent Schemes and Jurisdiction
However, the presence of fraudulent conduct may impact jurisdiction in
various ways. According to 28 U.S.C. § 1359, "A district court shall not have
jurisdiction of a civil action in which any party, by assignment or otherwise,
has been improperly or collusively made or joined to invoke the jurisdiction
of such court." While this statute specifically applies to federal district
courts, it illustrates the general principle that courts may decline
jurisdiction when it has been improperly or collusively invoked.
In the context of family law, the concept of "unjustifiable conduct" may also
be relevant. As noted in Applying the UCCJEA in Family Law (2021), "This
provision allows the court to decline to take jurisdiction if that person
engaged in unjustifiable conduct. Unjustifiable conduct is undefined by the
statute; therefore, the court has broad discretion." While this source
specifically discusses the UCCJEA (Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and
Enforcement Act), the principle may be applicable by analogy to divorce
proceedings where fraudulent conduct has occurred.
Interstate Fraud and Federal Statutes
The interstate nature of the fraudulent scheme described may potentially
implicate federal statutes related to wire fraud and racketeering. Under 18
U.S.C. § 1343, "Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme
or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false
or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to
be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in
interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined
under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both."
Additionally, 18 U.S.C. § 1961 defines "racketeering activity" to include "any
act which is indictable under any of the following provisions of title 18,
United States Code: ... section 1343 (relating to wire fraud), section 1344
(relating to financial institution fraud)." A "pattern of racketeering activity"
requires "at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred
after the effective date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within
ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a
prior act of racketeering activity."
Federal Jurisdiction Over Fraud in Domestic Relations
Cases
While the domestic relations exception generally precludes federal courts
from exercising jurisdiction over divorce proceedings, there may be limited
circumstances where federal courts can hear claims related to fraud in
connection with domestic relations matters. In Spindel v. Spindel, 283
F.Supp. 797 (E.D. N.Y. 1968), the court noted that "the federal courts are
competent to determine matters involving some aspects of marital status,
either directly or indirectly. The fact that, incidental to the exercise of
federal jurisdiction, there is an impact or effect on a matter which is
cognizable in the state courts cannot divest the federal court of its power."
However, federal courts generally resist attempts to use federal claims as a
means to interfere with state divorce proceedings. In Seaton v. Seaton, 971
F.Supp. 1188 (E.D. Tenn. 1997), the court emphasized that it "will not allow
the Act to become a gateway for domestic relations issues to slip into this
federal court" and that the court "must not be imported into the federal
courts." The court further clarified that federal jurisdiction should not be
used as "leverage" to tip the scales of distribution in a party's favor in
divorce proceedings.
Analysis of the Fraudulent Scheme's Impact
on Divorce Court Jurisdiction
State Court Jurisdiction Over Divorce Proceedings
Based on the domestic relations exception to federal jurisdiction, the divorce
court (a state court) in this case would generally have jurisdiction over the
divorce proceedings, regardless of the fraudulent conduct involved. As
established in Haynes v. Bass, NO. 6:18-CV-06086 (W.D. Ark. Dec 19, 2019)
and Merritt v. Grady, 23-cv-16243 (N.D. Ill. Jul 30, 2024), divorce
proceedings are considered outside of federal jurisdictional bounds and
belong to the laws of the states.
The fraudulent scheme described in the question involved actions taken in
both Texas and Oklahoma, with the ultimate divorce proceedings occurring
in Texas. The interstate nature of the fraud does not, in itself, divest the

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Texas divorce court of jurisdiction over the divorce proceedings. However, it
may raise questions about the appropriate venue and the potential for the
court to decline jurisdiction based on unjustifiable conduct.
Unjustifiable Conduct Doctrine
The fraudulent scheme described in the question likely constitutes
"unjustifiable conduct" that could potentially affect the divorce court's
exercise of jurisdiction. According to Applying the UCCJEA in Family Law
(2021), a court may decline to take jurisdiction if the person seeking to
invoke it has engaged in unjustifiable conduct. The court has broad
discretion in determining what constitutes unjustifiable conduct, as the term
is not specifically defined.
In this case, the mother's actions—attempting to obtain a fraudulent ex-
parte order, emptying the joint marital bank account across state lines, filing
a fraudulent divorce petition with false claims of abuse, serving an eviction
notice referencing a non-existent divorce and protective order, and serving a
settlement agreement without consent—could all be considered unjustifiable
conduct. These actions were clearly intended to manipulate the legal system
and gain an unfair advantage in the divorce proceedings.
Based on the unjustifiable conduct doctrine, the divorce court could
potentially decline to exercise jurisdiction or, more likely, take steps to
remedy the consequences of the fraudulent conduct. This might include
reconsidering orders that were based on fraudulent information, such as the
order removing the father from his home.
Impact of Collusion on Jurisdiction
Under 28 U.S.C. § 1359, "A district court shall not have jurisdiction of a civil
action in which any party, by assignment or otherwise, has been improperly
or collusively made or joined to invoke the jurisdiction of such court." While
this statute specifically applies to federal courts, it illustrates the principle
that courts may decline jurisdiction when it has been improperly or
collusively invoked.
In the present case, there appears to be collusion between the mother, her
stepfather, and potentially others to manipulate the divorce proceedings.
However, it's important to note that this collusion was not aimed at
improperly invoking the jurisdiction of the divorce court (as would be the
case if, for example, they falsified residency to establish jurisdiction in a
particular state). Rather, the collusion was aimed at obtaining favorable
outcomes within the context of proceedings where jurisdiction was already
properly established.
Therefore, while the collusive scheme described may provide grounds for
challenging specific orders and decisions made by the divorce court, it does
not necessarily affect the court's fundamental jurisdiction over the divorce
proceedings.

Potential Federal Claims
The interstate nature of the fraudulent scheme may potentially give rise to
federal claims under wire fraud statutes or the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). Under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, the transmission
of communications across state lines in furtherance of a scheme to defraud
may constitute wire fraud. Similarly, under 18 U.S.C. § 1961, a pattern of
racketeering activity (which includes wire fraud) may form the basis for a
RICO claim.
In this case, the mother's and stepfather's actions—emptying the joint
marital bank account across state lines, communicating across state lines to
carry out the fraudulent scheme, and engaging in multiple acts of fraud—
could potentially constitute wire fraud and a pattern of racketeering activity.
However, as noted in Merritt v. Grady, 23-cv-16243 (N.D. Ill. Jul 30, 2024),
even when federal-question jurisdiction is invoked for claims under federal
law, such as RICO, the domestic-relations exception to federal jurisdiction
still applies to matters of divorce, alimony, and child-custody.
This means that while the father might be able to pursue separate federal
claims based on the interstate fraud, these claims would need to be
adjudicated separately from the divorce proceedings, which would remain
under state court jurisdiction.
Balance Between Federal and State Jurisdiction
The tension between federal and state jurisdiction in cases involving fraud in
domestic relations matters is evident in the case law. In Spindel v. Spindel,
283 F.Supp. 797 (E.D. N.Y. 1968), the court acknowledged that federal
courts can determine matters involving some aspects of marital status,
either directly or indirectly, and that the impact on matters cognizable in
state courts does not divest the federal court of its power. This suggests that
federal courts could potentially hear claims related to the fraudulent
scheme, even if they impact the divorce proceedings.
However, as emphasized in Seaton v. Seaton, 971 F.Supp. 1188 (E.D. Tenn.
1997), federal courts are reluctant to allow federal claims to become a
"gateway" for domestic relations issues to enter federal court. The court in 
Seaton specifically noted that it would not allow a party to "tip the equitable
scales of distribution in her favor using the federal court as leverage."
In the present case, the father might be able to pursue federal claims
related to the interstate fraud separately from the divorce proceedings.
However, he would likely face resistance if he attempted to use these federal
claims to directly challenge or influence the divorce proceedings
themselves.

Implications for the Father's Legal Options
Given the fraudulent scheme's impact on the divorce court's jurisdiction and
proceedings, the father may have several legal options:
Challenge the divorce court's orders based on fraud: The father
could file motions in the divorce court to vacate or reconsider orders
that were based on fraudulent information, such as the order removing
him from his home. He could argue that the mother's unjustifiable
conduct tainted the proceedings and that the court should exercise its
discretion to remedy the consequences of this conduct.
Pursue separate federal claims: As discussed above, the father
might be able to pursue separate federal claims based on the interstate
fraud under wire fraud statutes or RICO. However, these claims would
need to be adjudicated separately from the divorce proceedings.
Request sanctions against the mother and her accomplices: The
father could request that the divorce court impose sanctions against
the mother, her stepfather, and any others who participated in the
fraudulent scheme. This could include monetary sanctions, attorney's
fees, or other remedies.
Challenge venue or request transfer: If the fraudulent scheme
involved manipulating venue to establish divorce proceedings in a
particular court, the father could potentially challenge venue or request
a transfer to a more appropriate court.
Conclusion
The fraudulent scheme described in the question does not eliminate the
divorce court's fundamental jurisdiction over the divorce proceedings, as
divorce matters generally fall under state court jurisdiction rather than
federal jurisdiction due to the domestic relations exception. However, the
fraudulent conduct may provide grounds for the divorce court to reconsider
specific orders and decisions that were based on fraudulent information.
The father may have several legal options for addressing the consequences
of the fraudulent scheme, including challenging the divorce court's orders
based on fraud, pursuing separate federal claims based on the interstate
fraud, requesting sanctions against the mother and her accomplices, and
potentially challenging venue or requesting a transfer.
The divorce court has broad discretion in determining what constitutes
unjustifiable conduct and how to remedy the consequences of such conduct.
Given the egregious nature of the fraudulent scheme described, it is likely
that the court would take steps to address the fraud and ensure that the
divorce proceedings are conducted fairly and equitably.
The interstate nature of the fraud may also give rise to potential federal
claims under wire fraud statutes or RICO. However, these claims would need
1.

to be adjudicated separately from the divorce proceedings, which would
remain under state court jurisdiction due to the domestic relations
exception.
In summary, while the fraudulent scheme does not eliminate the divorce
court's jurisdiction over the divorce proceedings, it may significantly impact
how that jurisdiction is exercised and provide grounds for challenging
specific orders and decisions made by the court.

In general, diversity jurisdiction exists when 'the matter in controversy
exceeds the sum or value of $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and
[involves] citizens of different States.' 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a). But federal
jurisdiction does not extend to 'the so-called 'domestic relations' and
'probate' exceptions.' Marshall v. Marshall, 547 U.S. 293, 299, 126 S. Ct.
1735, 1741, 164 L. Ed. 2d 480 (2006). The domestic relations exception
divests federal courts of jurisdiction over the issuance of a divorce, alimony,
or child custody decree. Ankenbrandt v. Richards, 504 U.S. 689, 704, 112 S.
Ct. 2206, 2215, 119 L. Ed. 2d 468 (1992).
Summary
The passage explains that federal courts do not have jurisdiction over
domestic relations matters such as divorce, alimony, or child custody due to
the domestic relations exception. This means that even if there is a
fraudulent scheme involved, the federal court would not have jurisdiction
over the divorce proceedings themselves. The jurisdiction would remain with
the state court handling the divorce, unless there are other federal issues
that could be addressed separately.

Because his complaint asserts claims under federal law, including claims
under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. §
1961 et seq., Merritt has invoked the Court&#39;s federal-question

exception to federal jurisdiction, divorce, alimony, and child-custody
decrees, are considered outside of federal jurisdictional bounds. Marshall v.

Richards, 504 U.S. 689, 703 (1992).
Summary
While federal-question jurisdiction can be invoked for claims under federal
law, such as the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, the
domestic-relations exception to federal jurisdiction means that matters of
divorce, alimony, and child-custody are typically outside federal jurisdiction
and are governed by state law. This suggests that the fraudulent activities
described in the question, which are related to a divorce proceeding, would
not typically affect the divorce court's jurisdiction, as these matters are
generally handled by state courts under the domestic-relations exception.

U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Tennessee
Extract
Even though the court is of the opinion that VAWA is constitutional, this
court will not allow the Act to become a gateway for domestic relations
issues to slip into this federal court. VAWA itself states that the statute does
not 'confer on the courts of the United States jurisdiction over any State law
claim seeking the establishment of a divorce, alimony, equitable distribution
of marital property, or child custody.' 42 U.S.C. § 13981(e)(4). Applying the
Sixth Circuit's mandate for district courts to interpret the true meaning of a
dispute, this court finds that the true character of the dispute in the present
case is the division of marital assets, at least insofar as the state law claims
regarding breach of fiduciary duty and the like are concerned. Plaintiff
merely seeks to tip the equitable scales of distribution in her favor using the
federal court as leverage. This is a matter to be resolved by the state courts
within the divorce proceeding and must not be imported into the federal
courts.
Summary
Federal courts do not have jurisdiction over state law claims related to
divorce, alimony, equitable distribution of marital property, or child custody.
The federal court emphasizes that such matters should be resolved by state
courts within the divorce proceedings. This suggests that the fraudulent
scheme described in the question, which involves divorce and related issues,
should be addressed by the state court rather than the federal court.

U.S. District Court — Eastern District of New York
Extract
Section 1332 of title 28 of the United States Code grants the district courts
jurisdiction in (1) a 'civil action,' involving (2) a 'controversy,' (3) exceeding
the 'value of $10,000,' (4) between 'citizens of different states.' This is a civil
action; the subject matter involves fraud and powers of attorney, both of
which are 'common heads of equity jurisdiction.' ... Despite occasional
extravagant disclaimers, it has long been recognized that the federal courts
are competent to determine matters involving some aspects of marital
status, either directly or indirectly. The fact that, incidental to the exercise
of federal jurisdiction, there is an impact or effect on a matter which is
cognizable in the state courts cannot divest the federal court of its power.
Summary
Federal courts have jurisdiction over civil actions involving fraud, even if
they have an impact on matters typically handled by state courts, such as
marital status. This suggests that the fraudulent scheme described could fall
under federal jurisdiction if it involves fraud and parties from different
states, as it affects the marital status indirectly.

Summary
The passage from 28 U.S.C. § 1359 indicates that a district court does not
have jurisdiction over a civil action if any party has been improperly or
collusively made or joined to invoke the court's jurisdiction. This suggests
that if the fraudulent scheme was designed to improperly or collusively
invoke the jurisdiction of the divorce court, then the court may not have
proper jurisdiction over the case. The statute is intended to prevent the
manipulation of jurisdiction through collusion or improper actions.

As used in this chapter- 'racketeering activity' means (A) any act or threat
involving murder, kidnapping, gambling, arson, robbery, bribery, extortion,
dealing in obscene matter, or dealing in a controlled substance or listed
chemical (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act), which
is chargeable under State law and punishable by imprisonment for more
than one year; (B) any act which is indictable under any of the following

least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the
effective date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years
(excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act
of racketeering activity;
Summary
The fraudulent scheme described could potentially fall under the definition
of "racketeering activity" as it involves acts that could be considered wire
fraud and financial institution fraud. These acts are listed under the
provisions of title 18, United States Code, which are considered
racketeering activities. If the scheme involves at least two acts of
racketeering activity, it could be considered a "pattern of racketeering
activity." This could potentially affect the divorce court's jurisdiction if the
scheme is prosecuted under federal racketeering laws, as it may involve
federal jurisdiction over the criminal aspects of the case.
