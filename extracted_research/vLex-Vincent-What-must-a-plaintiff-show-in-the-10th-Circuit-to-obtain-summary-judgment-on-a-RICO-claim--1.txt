Question
What must a plaintiff show in the 10th Circuit to obtain summary judgment
on a RICO claim?
Answer (Tenth Circuit)
Short response
To obtain summary judgment on a RICO claim in the 10th Circuit, a plaintiff
must demonstrate the four essential elements of a RICO claim: (1) conduct
(2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity, while
also showing injury to business or property caused by the violation and
proving there is no genuine issue of material fact as to these elements.
Summary
In the 10th Circuit, a plaintiff seeking summary judgment on a Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) claim must establish
several key elements through undisputed evidence. The plaintiff must
demonstrate that the defendant engaged in the conduct of an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity, with each of these components
having specific requirements established through case law. Additionally, the
plaintiff must show that they suffered an injury to business or property that
was directly caused by the defendant's RICO violation.
Beyond these basic elements, 10th Circuit precedent requires that the
plaintiff establish continuity of the racketeering activity, showing either a
closed-ended pattern extending over a substantial period or an open-ended
pattern with a threat of future criminal conduct. The plaintiff must satisfy
the particularity requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) when
fraud-based predicate acts are alleged. Finally, to obtain summary judgment
rather than merely survive a motion to dismiss, the plaintiff must
demonstrate that there is no genuine dispute of material fact regarding any
of these elements, providing sufficient undisputed evidence that would
entitle them to judgment as a matter of law.
Background and Relevant Law
Elements of a Civil RICO Claim
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provides a
civil cause of action under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) for "[a]ny person injured in
his business or property by reason of a violation of [18 U.S.C.] section 1962." 
Lynn v. Brown, No. 19-5062, No. 19-5063 (10th Cir. Feb 07, 2020). To prevail
on a RICO claim, the 10th Circuit has consistently recognized that a plaintiff
must establish three fundamental elements: "(1) that the defendant violated

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
§ 1962; (2) that the plaintiff's business or property was injured; and (3) that
the defendant's violation is the cause of that injury." Safe Streets All. v.
Hickenlooper, 859 F.3d 865, 881 (10th Cir. 2017); In re Epipen, 545 F.Supp.
3d 922, 948 (D. Kan. 2021); Jacobo-Rosas v. United States Attorney, CV
21-0789 KG/GBW (D. N.M. Mar 02, 2022).
When a plaintiff specifically alleges a violation of § 1962(c), as is common in
RICO cases, the 10th Circuit has refined these elements, requiring the
plaintiff to establish that the defendant "(1) conducted the affairs (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity." Robbins v.
Wilkie, 300 F.3d 1208, 1210 (10th Cir. 2002). This four-part formulation has
been consistently applied throughout the 10th Circuit, as evidenced by
multiple decisions including Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851, 858-859 (10th
Cir. 2022); Lopez v. Compa Indus., 1:23-cv-00303-LF (D. N.M. Apr 17, 2023);
Hall v. Witteman, 584 F.3d 859, 867 (10th Cir. 2009); and Tal v. Hogan, 453
F.3d 1244, 1261 (10th Cir. 2006).
For claims under § 1962(b), which involves acquiring or maintaining an
interest in or control of an enterprise through racketeering activity, a
plaintiff must prove:
Existence of an enterprise;
The enterprise engaged in, or its activities affected, interstate or
foreign commerce;
The defendant acquired or maintained an interest in or control of the
enterprise; and
The defendant acquired or maintained the interest through a pattern of
racketeering activity.
RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31).
To obtain summary judgment, a plaintiff must prove there are no genuine
issues of material fact as to any of these elements, and that they are entitled
to judgment as a matter of law on their RICO claim.
The "Conduct" Element
The "conduct" element requires showing that the defendant participated in
the operation or management of the enterprise itself. In the 10th Circuit, the
plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant "conducted or participated,
either directly or indirectly, in the conduct of the affairs of the enterprise." 
RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31). This requires showing some degree of
direction or control over the enterprise's affairs.
The "Enterprise" Element
An "enterprise" under RICO is defined as "a structured group of individuals
associated for a common purpose." Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
(2024-01-01). The enterprise must be distinct from the pattern of
racketeering activity. The 10th Circuit has acknowledged that there must be
a distinction between the "person" (the defendant) and the "enterprise" for
most RICO claims. As noted in secondary material, "for most RICO claims,
the plaintiff also must plead that the alleged 'person' and 'enterprise,' as
• 
• 
• 
• 

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
defined in RICO, are distinct." Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan
Should Be In Every Business's Arsenal (2022-02-03).
This "distinctiveness" requirement means that "a corporation generally will
not be liable for operating an 'enterprise' consisting of itself and its officers
or employees." Id. This principle is important for a plaintiff to address when
seeking summary judgment, as failure to establish this distinction can be
grounds for dismissal.
Additionally, the plaintiff must demonstrate that "the enterprise engaged in,
or its activities affected, interstate or foreign commerce." RICO: A Primer
(2022-01-31). Without this nexus to interstate commerce, a RICO claim will
fail.
The "Pattern" Element
To establish a "pattern of racketeering activity," a plaintiff in the 10th Circuit
must show at least two acts of racketeering activity, as specified in 18 U.S.C.
§ 1961(1), within 10 years of each other. Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851,
858-859 (10th Cir. 2022). However, the mere existence of two predicate acts
is insufficient. As the 10th Circuit clarified in Duran v. Carris, 238 F.3d 1268,
1271 (10th Cir. 2001), "In order to satisfy RICO's pattern requirement, [a
plaintiff] must show two elements—'a relationship between the predicates'
and 'the threat of continuing activity.'" This dual requirement of relationship
and continuity stems from the Supreme Court's decision in H.J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Tel. Co.
The 10th Circuit has consistently emphasized that "RICO is not aimed at the
isolated offender." Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1267 (10th Cir. 2006).
Therefore, "proof of two or more predicate acts are not sufficient to prove a
pattern unless there is a relationship between the predicate acts and a
threat of continuing activity." Id.
This continuity element receives significant attention in 10th Circuit
jurisprudence. As explained in Hall v. Witteman, 584 F.3d 859, 867 (10th Cir.
2009), continuity requires that "the predicates themselves amount to, or that
they otherwise constitute a threat of, continuing racketeering activity." This
can be satisfied by showing "a series of related predicates extending over a
substantial period of time," or proving that "the predicates are a regular way
of conducting the defendant's ongoing legitimate business or the RICO
enterprise." Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1267 (10th Cir. 2006).
In Advanced Optics Electronics, Inc. v. Robins, 633 F.Supp.2d 1237 (D. N.M.
2008), the court outlined four distinct requirements for establishing a
pattern of racketeering activity:
At least two acts that qualify as racketeering activity;
The acts must have occurred within ten years of each other;
The acts must be related to each other or part of a common scheme;
The acts must pose a threat of ongoing or expanding criminal activity.
The 10th Circuit has not established a "bright-line test" for what constitutes
a pattern, but it has indicated that "a single fraudulent scheme that has a
1.

3. 
4. 

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
definite purpose, the completion of which will end the scheme" does not
qualify as a pattern. Wichita Fed. Sav. & Loan v. Landmark Group, Inc., 674
F. Supp. 321, 331 (D. Kan. 1987). However, "an ongoing scheme [with] open-
ended fraudulent activity" might satisfy the pattern requirement. Id.
Additionally, the predicate acts must "extend over a substantial period of
time; a few weeks or months is considered insubstantial." Levey v. Wetherall,
Civil Action No. 1:19-cv-02294-DDD-MEH (D. Colo. Sep 29, 2020). The acts
must also "affect more than a single victim and aim to accomplish more than
one discrete goal." Id.
Racketeering Activity
"Racketeering activity" consists of the criminal offenses listed in 18 U.S.C. §
1961(1). Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851, 858-859 (10th Cir. 2022). Common
predicate acts include mail fraud, wire fraud, and other federal crimes.
While a defendant does not need to be criminally convicted of these
predicate acts for civil RICO liability to attach (Levey v. Wetherall, Civil
Action No. 1:19-cv-02294-DDD-MEH (D. Colo. Sep 29, 2020)), the plaintiff
must still establish that the defendant's conduct satisfied the elements of the
alleged predicate crimes.
For fraud-based predicates, which are common in RICO cases, the 10th
Circuit applies the heightened pleading standards of Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 9(b). D'Arezzo v. Guild Mortg. Co., 23-CV-0242-SWS (D. Wyo. Sep
24, 2024). This requires identifying "the party making false statements, and
the time, place, and contents of the false representation." Id. This
heightened standard applies not just at the pleading stage but also for
summary judgment, where a plaintiff must present evidence establishing
these details without genuine dispute.
Injury and Causation
For a plaintiff to have standing and ultimately prevail on a RICO claim, they
must establish that their business or property was injured by reason of the
defendant's violation of § 1962. Joseph v. U.S. Pub. Defenders Office (D. N.M.
Nov 09, 2021). The 10th Circuit has emphasized that the alleged RICO
violation must be the direct cause of the plaintiff's injury.
The causation requirement is particularly stringent. In In re Epipen
(Epinephrine Injection, Usp) Mktg., Sales Practices & Antitrust Litig., 568
F.Supp.3d 1184 (D. Kan. 2021), the court emphasized that a plaintiff must
show that the predicate acts themselves—not simply the alleged fraudulent
scheme—were the "but-for" cause of the plaintiff's injuries. The court
rejected the argument that merely showing a "link" between wrongful
conduct and injury was sufficient to establish RICO causation. Instead, it
required the plaintiff to demonstrate that "defendants' predicate acts—not
simply the alleged fraudulent scheme—caused plaintiffs' injuries." Id. This
represents a more demanding standard that plaintiffs must meet to obtain
summary judgment on RICO claims in the 10th Circuit.

Analysis: Requirements for Summary
Judgment on a RICO Claim
To obtain summary judgment on a RICO claim in the 10th Circuit, a plaintiff
must present undisputed evidence establishing each of the elements
discussed above. I will now analyze how these elements work together in the
context of summary judgment.
Summary Judgment Standard
While the provided materials do not specifically address the summary
judgment standard in RICO cases, it is important to note that under Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 56, a plaintiff seeking summary judgment must show
that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the plaintiff
is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. This standard applies to RICO
claims as with any other civil claim.
Establishing Violation of § 1962
As noted in Safe Streets All. v. Hickenlooper, 859 F.3d 865, 881 (10th Cir.
2017), the first element a plaintiff must prove is that the defendant violated
§ 1962. Most commonly, plaintiffs allege violations of § 1962(c), which makes
it unlawful for "any person employed by or associated with an enterprise...
to conduct or participate... in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity." Phelps v. Wichita Eagle-Beacon,
886 F.2d 1262, 1273 (10th Cir. 1989).
To establish this violation at summary judgment, a plaintiff must present
undisputed evidence of:
The existence of an enterprise affecting interstate commerce;
The defendant's association with or employment by the enterprise;
The defendant's participation in the conduct of the enterprise's affairs;
and
That this participation was through a pattern of racketeering activity.
Proving the Enterprise Element
At summary judgment, the plaintiff must present evidence establishing the
existence of an enterprise that is distinct from the defendant and the pattern
of racketeering activity. As the secondary literature notes, "a corporation
generally will not be liable for operating an 'enterprise' consisting of itself
and its officers or employees." Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan
Should Be In Every Business's Arsenal (2022-02-03).
The plaintiff must also present evidence that the enterprise affected
interstate commerce. Without this showing, the RICO claim will fail. Id.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Demonstrating a Pattern of Racketeering Activity
To obtain summary judgment, the plaintiff must present undisputed evidence
of at least two predicate acts of racketeering occurring within ten years of
each other. Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851, 858-859 (10th Cir. 2022).
However, merely establishing two predicate acts is insufficient.
The plaintiff must also demonstrate the relationship between these acts and
their continuity. For the relationship aspect, the plaintiff must show that the
predicate acts are "part of a common fraudulent scheme." Torwest DBC, Inc.
v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925, 928 (10th Cir. 1987).
For the continuity element, which has received significant attention in 10th
Circuit jurisprudence, the plaintiff must present evidence showing either:
"A series of related predicates extending over a substantial period of
time" (closed-ended continuity); or
That "the predicates are a regular way of conducting the defendant's
ongoing legitimate business or the RICO enterprise" (open-ended
continuity).
Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1267 (10th Cir. 2006).
The 10th Circuit has specifically noted that "a few weeks or months is
considered insubstantial" for establishing continuity. Levey v. Wetherall,
Civil Action No. 1:19-cv-02294-DDD-MEH (D. Colo. Sep 29, 2020).
Additionally, the predicate acts must "affect more than a single victim and
aim to accomplish more than one discrete goal." Id.
Proving the Predicate Acts
For each alleged predicate act, the plaintiff must present evidence that
satisfies the elements of the underlying criminal statute. When the predicate
acts involve fraud (as is common in RICO cases), the plaintiff must adhere to
the heightened pleading standards of Rule 9(b) and present evidence that
would satisfy this standard.
As noted in D'Arezzo v. Guild Mortg. Co., 23-CV-0242-SWS (D. Wyo. Sep 24,
2024), this requires identifying "the party making false statements, and the
time, place, and contents of the false representation." For summary
judgment purposes, the plaintiff must present evidence establishing these
details without genuine dispute.
Establishing Injury and Causation
To obtain summary judgment, the plaintiff must present undisputed evidence
that their business or property was injured and that this injury was directly
caused by the defendant's RICO violation.
The 10th Circuit applies a stringent causation standard, requiring the
plaintiff to demonstrate that the predicate acts themselves—not just the
overall scheme—were the "but-for" cause of the plaintiff's injuries. In re
Epipen (Epinephrine Injection, Usp) Mktg., Sales Practices & Antitrust
1. 
2. 

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Litig., 568 F.Supp.3d 1184 (D. Kan. 2021). This requires evidence directly
linking the specific racketeering acts to the plaintiff's harm.
Exceptions and Caveats
There are several important caveats and potential challenges that plaintiffs
seeking summary judgment on RICO claims in the 10th Circuit should
consider:
Standing Requirements
A plaintiff has standing to bring a RICO claim "only if he was injured in his
business or property by reason of the defendant's violation of § 1962." 
Joseph v. U.S. Pub. Defenders Office (D. N.M. Nov 09, 2021). Personal
injuries, emotional distress, or other non-economic harms do not qualify as
injuries to "business or property" under RICO.
Distinctiveness Requirement
As noted earlier, there must be a distinction between the "person" (the
defendant) and the "enterprise" in RICO claims under § 1962(c). If the
plaintiff fails to establish this distinction, the claim will not succeed. 
Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's
Arsenal (2022-02-03).
Strict Adherence to Technical Requirements
The technical requirements for a RICO claim "must be strictly adhered to
because the statute was designed to accomplish certain congressional
objectives." Saine v. AIA, INC., 582 F.Supp. 1299, 1308 (D. Colo. 1984).
Given the potential for treble damages, courts in the 10th Circuit require
clear and specific evidence establishing each element of the claim.
No Requirement for Criminal Conviction
While a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant committed
predicate acts that would be indictable under the specific statutes listed in
18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), there is no requirement that the defendant has been
formally convicted of these offenses. Levey v. Wetherall, Civil Action No.
1:19-cv-02294-DDD-MEH (D. Colo. Sep 29, 2020). However, the plaintiff still
bears the burden of proving all elements of the predicate crimes.
No Requirement to Show Organized Crime Connection
The 10th Circuit has explicitly recognized that "an actionable RICO claim
need not allege... that the defendants had ties to organized crime." Condict
v. Condict, 815 F.2d 579, 583 (10th Cir. 1987). Although this case was stated
as superseded by Maxwell v. Wilson, 766 P.2d 909 (N.M. 1988), this
particular point about organized crime connections not being required for

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
RICO claims remains valid law in the 10th Circuit and has been reaffirmed
in subsequent cases.
No Requirement for Distinct RICO Injury
Similarly, the 10th Circuit does not require plaintiffs to allege "a distinct
RICO injury" beyond the harm caused by the predicate acts. Condict v.
Condict, 815 F.2d 579, 583 (10th Cir. 1987). While this case was superseded
on other grounds, this particular point about no distinct RICO injury being
required has been maintained in 10th Circuit jurisprudence. The Plains
Resources, Inc. v. Gable, 782 F.2d 883, 887 (10th Cir. 1986) decision
confirms that "there is no room in the statutory language for an additional,
amorphous 'racketeering injury' requirement."
Conclusion
To obtain summary judgment on a RICO claim in the 10th Circuit, a plaintiff
must present undisputed evidence establishing each of the following
elements:
A violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962, typically subsection (c), which requires
proving:
The defendant's conduct of an enterprise's affairs
The existence of an enterprise affecting interstate commerce that
is distinct from the defendant
A pattern of racketeering activity, which includes:
At least two predicate acts of racketeering within ten years
A relationship between these acts (common scheme or
purpose)
Continuity of the racketeering activity (either closed-ended
over a substantial period or open-ended with threat of
continuation)
The predicate acts must be established with particularity when
based on fraud
Injury to the plaintiff's business or property that was directly caused by
the defendant's RICO violation, with evidence showing:
A concrete economic injury
That the specific predicate acts were the "but-for" cause of this
injury
No genuine dispute of material fact regarding any of these elements,
with sufficient undisputed evidence that would entitle the plaintiff to
judgment as a matter of law
The 10th Circuit takes a strict approach to RICO claims, emphasizing that
"RICO is not aimed at the isolated offender." Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244,
1267 (10th Cir. 2006). The pattern element requires more than just two
related predicate acts—it demands evidence of either closed-ended

continuity (related predicates over a substantial time period) or open-ended
continuity (threat of ongoing criminal activity).
For fraud-based RICO claims, which are common, the plaintiff must satisfy
the heightened pleading standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b),
identifying specific details about the fraudulent conduct. D'Arezzo v. Guild
Mortg. Co., 23-CV-0242-SWS (D. Wyo. Sep 24, 2024).
Finally, the causation requirement is particularly demanding in the 10th
Circuit, requiring proof that the specific predicate acts—not just the overall
scheme—were the direct cause of the plaintiff's injuries. In re Epipen
(Epinephrine Injection, Usp) Mktg., Sales Practices & Antitrust Litig., 568
F.Supp.3d 1184 (D. Kan. 2021).
Given these stringent requirements, obtaining summary judgment on a RICO
claim in the 10th Circuit presents a significant challenge. The plaintiff must
present compelling, undisputed evidence on each element to prevail as a
matter of law.

Extract
Instead, the dispositive problem stemmed from plaintiffs’ failure to show a
triable issue that the predicate acts—the use of the mails and wires to
further the alleged EpiPen pricing scheme—were the 'but-for' cause of
plaintiffs’ injuries. And that is why the court granted summary judgment
against plaintiffs’ RICO claim. Plaintiffs haven't shown that the court's
analysis clearly erred. ... Also, plaintiffs fail to show that the court clearly
erred by applying the law governing 'but-for' RICO causation. Plaintiffs
argue that RICO causation only requires them to show a 'link ... between the
wrongful conduct and the plaintiffs’ injury.' Doc. 2398 at 18 (emphasis
omitted). But, that's not a precise description of the causation requirement.
Instead, the governing case law requires a RICO plaintiff to establish
causation by showing that defendants’ predicate acts —not simply the
alleged fraudulent scheme—caused plaintiffs’ injuries.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the causation requirement for a RICO
claim in the Tenth Circuit. It emphasizes that plaintiffs must demonstrate
that the predicate acts, such as the use of mails and wires, were the "but-
for" cause of their injuries. This is a critical element for obtaining summary
judgment on a RICO claim, as it distinguishes between the wrongful conduct
and the specific acts that caused the injury.

2008)
U.S. District Court — District of New Mexico
Extract
To show a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO requires showing that
four separate elements have been met: (i) there must be at least two acts
that would qualify as racketeering activity; (ii) the acts must have occurred
within ten years of each other; (iii) the acts must be related to each other or
part of a common scheme; and (iv) the acts must pose a threat of ongoing or
expanding criminal activity.
Summary
Clear outline of the elements required to establish a pattern of racketeering
activity under RICO, which is essential for a plaintiff seeking summary
judgment on a RICO claim. The context of the passage is a federal district
court decision within the Tenth Circuit, making it directly relevant to the
question. The scope is generally applicable to RICO claims in this
jurisdiction.

Summary
To establish a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. 1962(c) in the Tenth Circuit,
a plaintiff must demonstrate four elements: participation in the conduct, of

requirement for civil RICO claims in this jurisdiction, as cited in previous
cases such as Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone and Phelps v. Wichita Eagle-
Beacon.

To prove a claim under § 1962(c), the Plaintiff must show that PIIGI (1)

Summary
Elements a plaintiff must demonstrate to establish a RICO claim under §
1962(c) in the Tenth Circuit. These elements include participation in the
conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. This is a
general requirement for RICO claims and is not limited to specific cases,
making it broadly applicable within the jurisdiction.
Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244 (10th Cir. 2006)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
The elements of a civil RICO claim are (1) investment in, control of, or
conduct of (2) an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a), (b), & (c). 'Racketeering activity' is defined in
18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B) as any 'act which is indictable' under federal law and
specifically includes mail fraud, wire fraud and racketeering. ... As a final
point, we question whether Plaintiffs' allegations of predicate acts satisfied
the requirement of 'a pattern of racketeering activity.' A 'pattern' of
racketeering is defined as 'at least two acts of racketeering activity, ... which
occurred within ten years' of each other. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). However,
because 'RICO is not aimed at the isolated offender,' Resolution Trust Corp.,
998 F.2d at 1544, proof of two or more predicate acts are not sufficient to
prove a pattern unless there is a relationship between the predicate acts and
a threat of continuing activity. H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492
U.S. 229, 239, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989); Duran v. Carris, 238
F.3d 1268, 1271 (10th Cir.2001). Continuity of threat requires both proof of
'a series of related predicates extending over a substantial period of time,'
as well as a 'showing that the predicates themselves involve a distinct threat
of long-term racketeering activity ... or that the predicates are a regular way
of conducting the defendant's ongoing legitimate business or the RICO
enterprise.' Resolution Trust Corp., 998 F.2d at 1543.
Summary
To obtain summary judgment on a RICO claim in the Tenth Circuit, a plaintiff
must demonstrate the elements of a civil RICO claim, which include: (1)
investment in, control of, or conduct of an enterprise; (2) through a pattern
of racketeering activity. The pattern of racketeering activity must consist of

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
at least two acts of racketeering that are related and pose a threat of
continued criminal activity. This requires showing a series of related
predicates over a substantial period and a distinct threat of long-term
racketeering activity.

To maintain a cause of action under § 1964(c), a plaintiff must plead and
ultimately prove: (1) that the defendant violated § 1962 ; (2) that the
plaintiff's business or property was injured; and (3) that the defendant's
violation is the cause of that injury. Id. ; see RJR, 136 S.Ct. at 2096–97.
Summary
Elements a plaintiff must establish to maintain a RICO claim under § 1964(c)
in the Tenth Circuit. Specifically, the plaintiff must demonstrate a violation of
§ 1962 by the defendant, an injury to the plaintiff's business or property, and
a causal link between the defendant's violation and the injury. This is a
general requirement for RICO claims and is applicable to cases within the
Tenth Circuit.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
A violation of section 1962(c) thus 'requires (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise
(3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.' Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex
Co., 473 U.S. 479, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 3285, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985). RICO
defines racketeering activity as, inter alia, any act that is indictable under
18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341 (mail fraud) or 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343 (wire fraud). See 18
U.S.C. Sec. 1961(1)(B). RICO also states that a ' "pattern of racketeering
activity" requires at least two acts of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. Sec.
1961(5). ... [T]o establish a RICO pattern, a plaintiff must also demonstrate
continuity, that is, 'the threat of continuing activity.' Sedima, 105 S.Ct. at
3285 n. 14. This element is derived from RICO's legislative history, which
indicates that RICO does not apply to 'sporadic activity' or to the 'isolated
offender'.
Summary
Elements required to establish a RICO violation, which are essential for a
plaintiff seeking summary judgment on a RICO claim. The plaintiff must

A violation of section 1962(c) thus 'requires (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise
(3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.' Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex
Co., 473 U.S. 479, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 3285, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985). RICO
defines racketeering activity as, inter alia, any act that is indictable under

U.S.C. Sec. 1961(1)(B). RICO also states that a 'pattern of racketeering
activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering activity. ... In this case, the
court and the parties assumed for purposes of the court's ruling that
defendants engaged in numerous racketeering acts. It is clear that when, as
here, the acts are part of a common fraudulent scheme, they satisfy the
relationship requirement of Sedima. ... However, to establish a RICO
pattern, a plaintiff must also demonstrate continuity, that is, 'the threat of
continuing activity.' Sedima, 105 S.Ct. at 3285 n. 14.
Summary
To obtain summary judgment on a RICO claim in the Tenth Circuit, a plaintiff
must demonstrate: (1) conduct, (2) of an enterprise, (3) through a pattern,
(4) of racketeering activity. The pattern of racketeering activity requires at
least two acts of racketeering, and these acts must be part of a common
fraudulent scheme to satisfy the relationship requirement. Additionally, the
plaintiff must demonstrate continuity, meaning the threat of continuing
activity, to establish a RICO pattern.

U.S. District Court — District of Colorado
Extract
"The elements of a civil RICO claim are (1) investment in, control of, or
conduct of (2) an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity." Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1261-62 (10th Cir. 2006).
"Racketeering activity" is defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B) as any "act which
is indictable" under federal law and specifically includes mail fraud, wire
fraud and racketeering. "A person does not have to be formally convicted of
any predicate act before [civil RICO] liability. .. may attach." Tal, 453 F.3d at
1261-62. But the predicate acts at issue must "extend over a substantial
period of time; a few weeks or months is considered insubstantial." Midwest
Grinding Co. v. Spitz, 976 F.2d 1016, 1025 (7th Cir. 1992) (alterations
adopted, quoting H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 242 (1989)). The
predicate acts must also affect more than a single victim and aim to
accomplish more than one discrete goal.
Summary
Elements required for a civil RICO claim in the 10th Circuit, which include
the investment in, control of, or conduct of an enterprise through a pattern
of racketeering activity. It also specifies that the predicate acts must extend
over a substantial period of time and affect more than a single victim. This
information is directly relevant to understanding what a plaintiff must
demonstrate to obtain summary judgment on a RICO claim in the 10th
Circuit.

U.S. District Court — District of New Mexico
Extract
To maintain a cause of action under § 1964(c), a plaintiff must plead and
ultimately prove: (1) that the defendant violated § 1962; (2) that the
plaintiffs business or property was injured; and (3) that the defendant's
violation is the cause of that injury. Id.; see RJR Nabisco, 136 S.Ct. at

2017); Robbins v. Wilkie, 300 F.3d 1208, 1210 (10th Cir.2002). A pattern of
racketeering activity must include commission of at least two predicate acts.
Summary
To obtain summary judgment on a RICO claim in the 10th Circuit, a plaintiff
must demonstrate that the defendant violated § 1962, that the plaintiff's
business or property was injured, and that the defendant's violation caused
that injury. Additionally, the plaintiff must show a pattern of racketeering
activity, which includes at least two predicate acts. This information is
applicable to RICO claims in the 10th Circuit.
Plains Resources, Inc. v. Gable, 782 F.2d 883 (10th Cir. 1986)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
If the defendant engages in a pattern of racketeering activity in a manner
forbidden by [Secs. 1962(a)-(c) ], and the racketeering activities injure the
plaintiff in his business or property, the plaintiff has a claim under Sec.
1964(c). There is no room in the statutory language for an additional,
amorphous 'racketeering injury' requirement. ... Where the plaintiff alleges
each element of the violation, the compensable injury necessarily is the
harm caused by predicate acts sufficiently related to constitute a pattern, for
the essence of the violation is the commission of those acts in connection
with the conduct of an enterprise.
Summary
The passage from the Plains Resources, Inc. v. Gable case provides insight
into what a plaintiff must demonstrate to succeed in a RICO claim in the
Tenth Circuit. The court clarifies that a plaintiff must show that the
defendant engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity that is prohibited by
Sections 1962(a)-(c) and that these activities caused injury to the plaintiff's
business or property. The court explicitly states that there is no requirement
for an additional "racketeering injury" beyond the harm caused by the
predicate acts themselves. This indicates that the focus is on the pattern of
racketeering activity and its direct impact on the plaintiff.

business or property was injured; and (3) the defendant's violation is the
cause of that injury. 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c); RJR Nabisco, 136 S.Ct. at 2096-97;
Safe Streets All. v. Hickenlooper, 859 F.3d 865, 881 (10th Cir. 2017);
Robbins v. Wilkie, 300 F.3d 1208, 1210 (10th Cir. 2002). Further, a plaintiff
has standing to bring a RICO claim only if he was injured in his business or
property by reason of the defendant's violation of § 1962. Robbins, 300 F.3d
at 1210.
Summary
To obtain summary judgment on a RICO claim in the Tenth Circuit, a plaintiff
must demonstrate that the defendant violated § 1962, that the plaintiff's
business or property was injured, and that the defendant's violation caused
that injury. Additionally, the plaintiff must have standing, which requires
showing injury to business or property due to the defendant's violation of §
1962.
Saine v. AIA, INC., 582 F.Supp. 1299 (D. Colo. 1984)
U.S. District Court — District of Colorado
Extract
The technical requirements for a § 1964(c) claim must be strictly adhered to
because the statute was designed to accomplish certain congressional
objectives. See Noland v. Gurley, supra. In face of the difficulties the courts
have had in interpreting the provisions of RICO and also in face of the treble
damage liability which defendants are subject to, it is imperative that Saine
and NHI, as well as the court, be placed on clear notice as to the elements
constituting AIA's RICO allegations.
Summary
The passage emphasizes the importance of strictly adhering to the technical
requirements of a § 1964(c) RICO claim. This suggests that for a plaintiff to
obtain summary judgment on a RICO claim, they must clearly establish the
elements of the claim as required by the statute. The passage highlights the
need for clear notice of the elements constituting the RICO allegations,
which implies that a plaintiff must provide detailed and specific evidence to
support each element of the RICO claim.

Condict v. Condict, 826 F.2d 923 (10th Cir. 1987)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
Specifically, the defendants concede that an actionable RICO claim need not
allege a distinct RICO injury, nor need it allege that the defendants have
already been indicted for, or convicted of, the predicate acts of mail or wire
fraud, or that the defendants had ties to organized crime. However, the
defendants do argue that under Sedima the plaintiffs must still allege that
the defendants are conducting, or are participating in conducting, the affairs
of an 'enterprise,' i.e., Condict Ranches, 'through a pattern of racketeering
activity.' In this particular, the defendants argue that the complaint is fatally
deficient, while plaintiffs argue that the complaint does measure up to
Sedima and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962(c).
Summary
In the Tenth Circuit, a plaintiff does not need to show a distinct RICO injury,
nor that the defendants have been indicted or convicted of predicate acts,
nor that they have ties to organized crime. However, the plaintiff must allege
that the defendants are conducting or participating in the conduct of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, as per 18 U.S.C. Sec.
1962(c). This aligns with the requirements set forth in the Sedima case.
Lynn v. Brown, No. 19-5062, No. 19-5063 (10th Cir. Feb 07, 2020)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
A civil RICO claim may be brought by '[a]ny person injured in his business or
property by reason of a violation of [18 U.S.C.] section 1962.' 18 U.S.C. §
1964(c). Ms. Lynn alleges in her complaint that the defendants violated the
entire RICO statute, but as best we can determine she is attempting to
allege that each of them violated § 1962(c). To state a civil RICO claim for
violation of § 1962(c), Ms. Lynn was required to 'plausibly allege that the
defendants each (1) conducted the affairs (2) of an enterprise (3) through a

=== PAGE 19 ===

pattern (4) of racketeering activity.' Safe StreetsAll. v. Hickenlooper, 859 F.
3d 865, 882 (10th Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Summary
To state a civil RICO claim for violation of § 1962(c) in the Tenth Circuit, a
plaintiff must plausibly allege that the defendants each conducted the affairs
of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. This requirement
is generally applicable to civil RICO claims in this jurisdiction.
Condict v. Condict, 815 F.2d 579 (10th Cir. 1987)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
Specifically, the defendants concede that an actionable RICO claim need not
allege a distinct RICO injury, nor need it allege that the defendants have
already been indicated for, or convicted of, the predicate acts of mail or wire
fraud, or that the defendants had ties to organized crime. However, the
defendants do argue that under Sedima the plaintiffs must still allege that
the defendants are conducting, or are participating in conducting, the affairs
of an 'enterprise,' i.e., Condict Ranches, 'through a pattern of racketeering
activity.' In this particular, the defendants argue that the complaint is fatally
deficient, while plaintiffs argue that the complaint does measure up to
Sedima and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962(c).
Summary
In the Tenth Circuit, a plaintiff does not need to show a distinct RICO injury,
a conviction of predicate acts, or ties to organized crime to make a RICO
claim. However, the plaintiff must allege that the defendants are conducting
or participating in the conduct of an enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity, as per 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962(c). This requirement is
crucial for establishing a RICO claim.
Hall v. Witteman, 584 F.3d 859 (10th Cir. 2009)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
"In order to bring a RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege a violation of 18
U.S.C. § 1962, which consists of four elements: (1) conduct (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity." Gillmor v.
Thomas, 490 F.3d 791, 797 (10th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks
omitted). A "`pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of
racketeering activity." 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). Those acts, commonly referred to

=== PAGE 20 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
as "predicate acts," must be violations of certain statutes. See id. § 1961(1).
Mr. Hall's complaint alleges violations of federal mail-fraud, wire-fraud, and
extortion statutes. Although the district court held those allegation to be
inadequate, we need not address that issue. Even if the allegations of
predicate acts were adequate, we agree with the district court that the
complaint does not adequately allege a "pattern" of racketeering activity
because it fails to allege sufficient continuity to sustain a RICO claim. "RICO
is not aimed at the isolated offender." Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1267
(10th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). To satisfy RICO's pattern
requirement, Mr. Hall needed to allege not only that the defendants had
committed two or more predicate acts, but also "that the predicates
themselves amount to, or that they otherwise constitute a threat of,
continuing racketeering activity." H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229,
240, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989).
Summary
To bring a RICO claim in the Tenth Circuit, a plaintiff must allege a violation
of 18 U.S.C. § 1962, which includes four elements: conduct, of an enterprise,
through a pattern, of racketeering activity. The pattern of racketeering
activity requires at least two predicate acts that must be violations of certain
statutes. Additionally, the plaintiff must demonstrate that these predicate
acts amount to or constitute a threat of continuing racketeering activity. This
information is essential for understanding what a plaintiff must show to
obtain summary judgment on a RICO claim in the Tenth Circuit.
D&#39;Arezzo v. Guild Mortg. Co., 23-CV-0242-SWS (D. Wyo. Sep 24, 2024)
U.S. District Court — District of Wyoming
Extract
To bring a successful RICO claim, D'Arezzo must assert with particularity
the conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. Tal v.
Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1261 (10th Cir. 2006). The particularity requirement
of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) applies to RICO claims and requires
the complaint to identify the party making false statements, and the time,
place, and contents of the false representation. Id. at 1263 (quoting Koch v.
Koch Indus., 203 F.3d 1202, 1236 (10th Cir. 2000)).
Summary
The passage provides specific requirements for a plaintiff to successfully
assert a RICO claim in the 10th Circuit, which includes demonstrating the
conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity with
particularity. This involves identifying the party making false statements and
detailing the time, place, and contents of the false representation, as
required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b).

Wichita Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan v. Landmark Group, Inc., 674 F. Supp. 321 (D.
Kan. 1987)
U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
The Tenth Circuit has yet to 'formulate a bright-line test' for determining the
existence of a 'pattern'. Torwest DBC, Inc., v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925, 929 (10th
Cir.1987). In Torwest, it found what was not a pattern: a single fraudulent
scheme that has a definite purpose, the completion of which will end the
scheme. In reaching this decision, the Tenth Circuit contrasted the type of
scheme involved in this case, stating: A more difficult question is presented
when the RICO claim is based on one scheme involving one victim, but the
plan contemplates open-ended fraudulent activity and does not have a single
goal that, when achieved, will bring the activity to an end. Some courts have
found that such an ongoing scheme is itself sufficient to satisfy the
continuity element of a RICO pattern.
Summary
The Tenth Circuit has not established a definitive test for what constitutes a
"pattern" of racketeering activity under RICO. However, it has indicated that
a single scheme with a definite end does not satisfy the pattern requirement,
whereas an ongoing scheme with open-ended fraudulent activity might. This
is crucial for a plaintiff seeking summary judgment on a RICO claim, as they
must demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activity.
Duran v. Carris, 238 F.3d 1268 (10th Cir. 2001)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
In order to satisfy RICO's pattern requirement, Mr. Duran must show two
elements--'a relationship between the predicates' and 'the threat of
continuing activity.' H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239
(1989) (quotation omitted). Interpreting RICO's legislative history, the
Supreme Court stated that the pattern element is not satisfied by a showing
of relatedness alone. Id. at 240. '[I]t must also be shown that the predicates
themselves amount to, or that they otherwise constitute a threat of,
continuing racketeering activity.' Id.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the requirements for establishing a RICO
claim, specifically the need to demonstrate both a relationship between
predicate acts and a threat of continuing criminal activity. This is essential

requirements for such a claim.
Phelps v. Wichita Eagle-Beacon, 886 F.2d 1262 (10th Cir. 1989)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
Plaintiff has alleged that defendants violated the civil Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. Secs. 1961-1965. That Act makes it
unlawful for 'any person employed by or associated with an enterprise ... to
conduct or participate ... in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through
a pattern of racketeering activity....' 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962(c). Thus, in order to
state a RICO claim, plaintiff must sufficiently allege '(1) conduct (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.' Sedima,

Summary
Elements required to state a RICO claim, which are essential for a plaintiff
to establish in order to succeed in obtaining summary judgment. The
elements include conduct, an enterprise, a pattern, and racketeering
activity. This is a general requirement for RICO claims and is applicable to
cases within the Tenth Circuit.

his business or property by reason of the defendant's violation of the RICO
laws. Absent these allegations, the lawsuit must be dismissed. RICO
standing is distinct from the more well-known concept of constitutional
standing. For RICO claims, in addition to pleading a sufficiently specific
injury, including allegations that the plaintiff has suffered known damages
(as opposed to mere speculative or unprovable damages), the plaintiff must
allege that he suffered an injury to his business or property that bears some
causal relationship to the alleged act or acts that violated RICO.
Summary
For a plaintiff to succeed in a RICO claim, they must demonstrate a specific
injury to their business or property that is causally linked to the defendant's
alleged RICO violation. This requirement is distinct from constitutional
standing and necessitates showing a concrete financial loss or deprivation of
property use or transfer. This information is generally applicable to RICO
claims and is not limited to specific cases.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
To prove a violation of Section 1962(b), a plaintiff must prove the following
elements: * Existence of an enterprise; * The enterprise engaged in, or its
activities affected, interstate or foreign commerce; * The defendant acquired
or maintained, directly or indirectly, an interest in or control of the
enterprise; and * The defendant acquired or maintained the interest through
a pattern of racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt.
Courts have held that a plaintiff must allege a specific nexus between
control of the named enterprise and the alleged racketeering activity. ... To
prove a violation of Section 1962(c), a plaintiff must prove the following
elements: * Existence of an enterprise; * The enterprise engaged in, or its
activities affected, interstate or foreign commerce; * The defendant was
employed by or was associated with the enterprise; * The defendant
conducted or participated, either directly or indirectly, in the conduct of the
affairs of the enterprise; and * The defendant participated in the affairs of
the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of
unlawful debt.
Summary
Elements a plaintiff must prove to establish a violation of Sections 1962(b)
and 1962(c) of the RICO statute. These elements include the existence of an
enterprise, the enterprise's engagement in or effect on interstate or foreign
commerce, and the defendant's involvement with the enterprise through a

pattern of racketeering activity. This information is crucial for understanding
what a plaintiff must demonstrate to succeed in a RICO claim, which is
relevant to obtaining summary judgment.
Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's
Arsenal
Extract
Second, to prove most types of RICO claims, the plaintiff must plead that the
defendant committed some qualifying criminal action, the most common of
which is mail, wire or securities fraud. Business deals gone sour do not
count. Rather, the plaintiff must be able to prove the elements of the
asserted crime, and often an intent to defraud. If there is nothing criminal in
nature about the complained-of conduct, RICO should not apply. It is an
abuse of the RICO statute to attempt to shoehorn ordinary business or
contractual disputes into a civil RICO claim. Third, the plaintiff must plead a
pattern of racketeering activity for most RICO claims. If the alleged conduct
occurred once or twice, or was not continuous, it cannot form a pattern of
conduct sufficient to support a RICO claim. And oftentimes, because there is
a fraud component, those instances must be particularly identified in the
plaintiff's pleading—a barrier that can prove difficult to accomplish. Fourth,
for most RICO claims, the plaintiff also must plead that the alleged 'person'
and 'enterprise,' as defined in RICO, are distinct. While often technical, this
'distinctiveness' requirement provides that a corporation generally will not
be liable for operating an 'enterprise' consisting of itself and its officers or
employees. If a business is alleged to have violated RICO based on
intracompany actions, then the RICO claim has a good chance of dismissal.
Fifth, a RICO claim cannot exist without some nexus to interstate commerce.
If the alleged conduct does not affect interstate commerce, it must be
dismissed.
Summary
Detailed explanation of the elements a plaintiff must establish to prove a
RICO claim, which is relevant to understanding what must be shown to
obtain summary judgment. It outlines the need to prove a qualifying criminal
action, a pattern of racketeering activity, distinctiveness between the person
and enterprise, and a nexus to interstate commerce.

of prevailing on the merits of such claims. Instead, the Supreme Court
merely confirmed that foreign plaintiffs can meet the domestic injury
requirement, which is but one of the many requirements needed to
substantiate a civil RICO claim. Would-be plaintiffs still must overcome
highly-burdensome challenges inherent in civil RICO claims, including
exacting requirements to establish a RICO enterprise, a pattern of
racketeering activity and the elements of specifically-enumerated predicate
acts. When claims are fraud-based (most civil RICO theories are), the
heightened specificity requirements of Rule 9 of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure compound each of these burdens.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the burdens and requirements a plaintiff
must meet to substantiate a civil RICO claim, which are relevant to
obtaining summary judgment. It highlights the need to establish a RICO
enterprise, a pattern of racketeering activity, and the elements of
specifically-enumerated predicate acts, along with meeting the heightened
specificity requirements of Rule 9 for fraud-based claims.
