Question
The respondent alleges that all state appellate remedies (including multiple
mandamus petitions and recusal motions) were denied without explanation,
and that recusal proceedings were manipulated by judges and court staff to
control the outcome. Younger abstention may not apply if the state forum is
inadequate to adjudicate federal claims, such as where state procedures are
systematically biased or unavailable (Middlesex County Ethics Committee v.
Garden State Bar Ass’n, 457 U.S. 423 (1982)). If the respondent can
demonstrate that state remedies were not merely unsuccessful but
fundamentally unavailable or unfair due to manipulation or bias, this may
support an exception to Younger abstention and justify federal intervention.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
If the respondent can show that state appellate remedies were not just
unsuccessful but fundamentally unavailable or unfair due to manipulation or
bias, an exception to Younger abstention may apply, allowing federal court
intervention. The adequacy and fairness of state procedures are central to
determining whether abstention is appropriate.
Summary
The Younger abstention doctrine generally requires federal courts to refrain
from interfering in ongoing state judicial proceedings, but this rule is not
absolute. Where a respondent demonstrates that state remedies are
systematically biased, manipulated, or otherwise fundamentally inadequate
to address federal claims, federal courts may decline to abstain and instead
exercise jurisdiction to ensure constitutional rights are protected.
The key inquiry is whether the state forum provides a fair and adequate
opportunity to raise federal claims. If the respondent can substantiate
allegations of pervasive bias, manipulation of recusal proceedings, or denial
of remedies without explanation, these circumstances may fall within
recognized exceptions to Younger abstention, justifying federal intervention.
Background and Relevant Law
Case Law
The doctrine of Younger abstention, as articulated in federal jurisprudence,
directs federal courts to avoid interfering with ongoing state judicial
proceedings when three conditions are met: (1) the federal action would
interfere with an ongoing state proceeding; (2) the state has a significant
interest in regulating the subject matter; and (3) the state forum provides an
adequate opportunity to raise constitutional challenges. This framework is

clearly set out in Alexander v. Dall. Cnty. Health & Human Servs. Dep't,
3:23-cv-02776-S (BT) (N.D. Tex. Jan 16, 2024), which relies on the standards
from Bice v. Louisiana Public Defender Board and the Supreme Court’s
decision in Middlesex County Ethics Committee v. Garden State Bar
Association.
The adequacy of the state forum is a critical element. If the state
proceedings do not afford a meaningful opportunity to present federal
claims—due to bias, manipulation, or unavailability of remedies—then the
third prong of the Younger test is not satisfied, and abstention is not
required. This principle is reinforced in Alexander v. Dall. Cnty. Health &
Human Servs. Dep't.
Secondary Materials
Secondary authorities further clarify the contours of the Younger doctrine
and its exceptions. One essential exception, as discussed in the article
"ABSTAINING FROM ABSTENTION: WHY YOUNGER ABSTENTION DOES
NOT APPLY IN 42 U.S.C [section] 1983 BAIL LITIGATION," is the so-called
"third exception," which encompasses unusual circumstances warranting
equitable relief. This exception has been interpreted to include cases where
due process concerns arise from state court bias or the lack of an adequate
remedy in state court. The article notes that while this exception is rarely
invoked, it is well-established, with Gibson v. Berryhill cited as a leading
example where federal intervention was permitted due to state bias.
Another secondary source, "ABSTAINING EQUITABLY," emphasizes that
federal courts may intervene when there is evidence of bad faith prosecution
or demonstrable partiality by state decisionmakers. The rationale is that
requiring a federal plaintiff to continue in a biased or manipulated state
process would subject them to the very procedural harms they seek to
remedy.
The article "Beyond the 'embryonic stage': Younger v. Harris and
'proceedings of substance on the merits' in the context of preliminary
injunctive relief" further supports the view that Younger abstention is not
absolute. It identifies several exceptions, including where the state forum is
inadequate to address federal claims, where there is manipulation or bias, or
where extraordinary circumstances would result in irreparable injury absent
federal intervention.
A supplementary source, "GROUPS AND RIGHTS IN INSTITUTIONAL
REFORM LITIGATION," reiterates that abstention is only required if the
state proceedings provide an adequate opportunity to raise constitutional
challenges. If the federal plaintiff’s rights differ from those adjudicated in
state proceedings, or if the federal plaintiff is a different entity, abstention
may not apply.
Analysis
The respondent’s allegations—that all state appellate remedies, including
mandamus petitions and recusal motions, were denied without explanation,

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
and that recusal proceedings were manipulated by judges and court staff—
raise serious questions about the adequacy and fairness of the state forum.
Under the Younger doctrine, the federal court must determine whether the
state proceedings offer a fair and meaningful opportunity to adjudicate
federal claims.
The first two prongs of the Younger test—ongoing state proceedings and
important state interests—are typically satisfied in most cases involving
state judicial processes. The critical issue here is the third prong: whether
the state forum is adequate.
According to Alexander v. Dall. Cnty. Health & Human Servs. Dep't, the
adequacy of the state forum is essential. If the respondent can demonstrate
that state remedies were not merely unsuccessful but fundamentally
unavailable or unfair—due to manipulation, bias, or denial without
explanation—then the state forum is not adequate, and Younger abstention
should not apply.
The secondary materials reinforce this analysis. The "third exception" to
Younger, as discussed in "ABSTAINING FROM ABSTENTION," includes
cases where due process is compromised by state court bias or the lack of
an adequate remedy. The rare but recognized exception for state bias, as in 
Gibson v. Berryhill, supports the proposition that federal intervention is
justified when state procedures are fundamentally unfair.
"ABSTAINING EQUITABLY" further explains that when there is evidence of
bad faith prosecution or demonstrable partiality, federal courts may address
constitutional challenges directly, rather than relying on state
decisionmakers to cure their own bias. This is particularly relevant where
recusal proceedings are manipulated, as alleged by the respondent.
"Beyond the 'embryonic stage'" confirms that Younger abstention does not
apply where the state forum is inadequate, including situations involving
manipulation or bias. The adequacy of the state forum is thus a threshold
issue: if the respondent can substantiate their claims of manipulation and
bias, the federal court is not compelled to abstain.
The supplementary material, "GROUPS AND RIGHTS IN INSTITUTIONAL
REFORM LITIGATION," also supports the view that abstention is not
required if the state proceedings do not provide an adequate opportunity to
raise constitutional challenges.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the exceptions to Younger abstention are well-established, they are
narrowly construed and rarely invoked. The burden is on the respondent to
provide compelling evidence that state remedies are not just unsuccessful
but fundamentally unavailable or unfair due to manipulation or bias. Mere
dissatisfaction with the outcome of state proceedings is insufficient; there
must be a showing of systemic bias, manipulation, or denial of remedies that
renders the state forum inadequate.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The secondary materials caution that the "third exception" to Younger is
rarely applied, and federal courts are generally reluctant to intervene in
state judicial processes absent clear evidence of extraordinary
circumstances. The respondent must therefore present specific, credible
evidence of bias or manipulation, such as patterns of unexplained denials,
irregularities in recusal proceedings, or other indicia of partiality.
It is also important to note that the adequacy of the state forum is assessed
at the time the federal action is filed. If subsequent developments in the
state proceedings cure any alleged inadequacies, abstention may still be
appropriate.
Conclusion
In summary, the Younger abstention doctrine generally precludes federal
court intervention in ongoing state judicial proceedings, but an exception
exists where the state forum is fundamentally inadequate due to bias,
manipulation, or unavailability of remedies. The respondent’s allegations—if
substantiated—could bring the case within this exception, as federal courts
are not required to abstain when state procedures are systematically biased
or manipulated to control the outcome.
The adequacy and fairness of state remedies are central to the Younger
analysis. If the respondent can demonstrate that state appellate remedies
and recusal proceedings were denied without explanation and manipulated
by judges or court staff, this may justify federal intervention to protect
constitutional rights. However, the exception is narrowly construed, and the
respondent bears the burden of proving that the state forum is
fundamentally unfair or unavailable.

Under the Younger abstention doctrine, federal courts should generally
decline to exercise jurisdiction over requests to enjoin state proceedings
when “(1) the federal proceeding would interfere with an ‘ongoing state
judicial proceeding'; (2) the state has an important interest in regulating the
subject matter of the claim; and (3) the plaintiff has ‘an adequate
opportunity in the state proceedings to raise constitutional challenges.’”

Summary
Conditions under which the Younger abstention doctrine applies,
emphasizing that federal courts should abstain from intervening in state
proceedings if the state provides an adequate opportunity to raise
constitutional challenges. This directly relates to the proposition, as it
suggests that if the state procedures are biased or manipulated, thus not
providing an adequate opportunity, the Younger abstention may not apply.
The reference to Middlesex County Ethics Committee v. Garden State Bar
Ass’n further supports the idea that the adequacy of state proceedings is a
critical factor in determining the applicability of Younger abstention.

Extract
Younger does not compel abstention, however, where extraordinary
circumstances indicate that a party will suffer irreparable injury in the
absence of federal intervention, where a state prosecution is brought in bad
faith, where a state statute is patently unconstitutional, where a state
proceeding does not provide an adequate forum for a party's claims, where a
state submits to federal jurisdiction, or where a party waives the abstention
argument by failing to raise it.
Summary
Younger abstention is not absolute and does not apply in situations where
the state forum is inadequate to address federal claims. This includes
circumstances where there is manipulation or bias in state proceedings,
which aligns with the proposition that if state remedies are fundamentally
unavailable or unfair, federal intervention may be justified.

Extract
Only the third Younger abstention exception has ever been applied, which
exempts 'any other unusual circumstances that would call for equitable
relief.' This exception has been interpreted to include due process concerns
of state court bias and the lack of an adequate remedy in state court.

However, even this last exception is invoked rarely. Gibson v. Berryhill,
decided two years after Younger, is one of the few instances in which the
Court permitted federal intervention on account of state bias.
Summary
The third exception to Younger abstention involves unusual circumstances
that warrant equitable relief, including due process concerns related to state
court bias and the lack of an adequate remedy in state court. The passage
references Gibson v. Berryhill as a case where federal intervention was
allowed due to state bias, which aligns with the proposition that if state
remedies are fundamentally unavailable or unfair due to manipulation or
bias, an exception to Younger abstention may be justified.

Extract
Abstention, long a problem in IR litigation, is a good example of the kind of
problem that open acknowledgment about rights design could resolve. (245)
Under Younger v. Harris and its progeny, a federal court must abstain from
adjudicating a constitutional challenge if doing so would 'improper[ly]
intru[de] on the right of a state to enforce its laws in its own courts.' (241)' If
there exists an 'ongoing state judicial proceeding' that 'implicate[s]
important state interests,' abstention is required if the federal plaintiff has
'an adequate opportunity in the state proceedings to raise constitutional
challenges.' (247)... A federal court does not abstain under Younger if the
plaintiff asserts a right that differs from what the state proceeding
adjudicates. (258) Nor does Younger apply if the federal plaintiff is a
different jural entity from the rights-holder in the state proceeding. (25)
Summary
Application of Younger abstention and highlights that federal courts must
abstain from intervening in state matters unless the state proceedings do
not provide an adequate opportunity to raise constitutional challenges. It
also notes that Younger abstention does not apply if the federal plaintiff's
rights differ from those adjudicated in state proceedings or if the federal
plaintiff is a different entity. This supports the proposition that if state
remedies are inadequate or biased, federal intervention may be justified.

What is more, where there is evidence that a bad faith prosecution is a form
of harassment of a criminal defendant, no dismissal of any single criminal
proceeding can effectively guarantee that the harassment will not continue.
A defendant under those circumstances may choose to forgo constitutional
protected conduct to avoid perpetual prosecution, even if the net result is
perpetual dismissals of the charges. Second, where the state decisionmaker
is demonstrably partial, the Supreme Court may address constitutional
challenges, rather than relying on state decisionmakers to cure their own
bias. Otherwise, here too, Younger doctrine would essentially compel a
federal plaintiff to subject oneself more substantially to the procedural
harms they are attempting to redress.
Summary
The passage discusses exceptions to the Younger abstention doctrine,
specifically in cases where there is evidence of bad faith prosecution or
demonstrable partiality by state decisionmakers. It highlights that federal
courts may intervene when state procedures are biased or manipulated,
which aligns with the proposition that if state remedies are fundamentally
unavailable or unfair due to manipulation or bias, federal intervention may
be justified.
