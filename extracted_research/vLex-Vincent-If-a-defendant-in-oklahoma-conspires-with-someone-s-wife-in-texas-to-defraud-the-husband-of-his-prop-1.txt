Question
If a defendant in oklahoma conspires with someone's wife in texas to
defraud the husband of his property interests by filing documents with false
statements with the intention of presenting them to the texas courts and
they contain material false statements, and this plan works, does this open
up a RICO claim if they also transferred money across state lines and
emptied the joint marital bank account under a deceptive promise of
wanting to help if their actions include transferring money across state
lines, and then preparing a false affidavit of inability to pay in oklahoma to
be presented to texas courts as well as an original divorce petition claiming
an active protective order exists against the husband which is not true, and
then the husband was removed from his home which is also his place of
business?
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
The described actions potentially support a civil RICO claim as they appear
to constitute a pattern of racketeering activity connected to an enterprise
with multiple predicate acts including fraud, false statements, and interstate
money transfers that affected interstate commerce and directly injured the
husband's business and property interests. To succeed, the husband would
need to show that the defendants engaged in at least two qualifying
predicate acts that were related and continuous, forming a pattern of
racketeering activity that directly caused his injuries.
Summary
The scenario described involves potential racketeering activity that may
support a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962. The actions described—
conspiring across state lines, filing false documents with courts, making
material false statements, transferring money across state lines, emptying a
joint bank account under false pretenses, preparing a false affidavit, and
filing a divorce petition with false claims about a protective order—
potentially constitute multiple predicate acts required for a pattern of
racketeering activity under RICO. The interstate nature of these activities,
involving actions in both Oklahoma and Texas, satisfies RICO's requirement
for a nexus to interstate commerce.
For a successful RICO claim, the husband would need to demonstrate: (1) a
person or persons who engaged in (2) a pattern of racketeering activity (3)
connected to an enterprise, which resulted in (4) injury to his business or
property. The pattern requirement would be satisfied by showing at least
two predicate acts of racketeering within ten years that are related and
demonstrate continuity. Given that the actions resulted in the husband being
removed from his home, which was also his place of business, and the

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
fraudulent transfer of property and financial assets, he appears to have
suffered a direct injury to his business and property interests that could
support standing for a civil RICO claim.
Background and Relevant Law
Statutory Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) was
enacted as Title IX of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970. The relevant
statutory provisions for a civil RICO claim are found in 18 U.S.C. §§
1961-1964.
Prohibited Activities - 18 U.S.C. § 1962
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1962, four types of activities are prohibited:
"It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of racketeering
activity or through collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or maintain,
directly or indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise which is
engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce."
Additionally, subsection (d) states: "It shall be unlawful for any person to
conspire to violate any of the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this
section."
This provision makes it unlawful to engage in or conspire to engage in a
pattern of racketeering activity that affects interstate commerce, which is
directly relevant to the scenario described. The conspiracy between the
defendant in Oklahoma and someone's wife in Texas to defraud the husband
potentially violates § 1962(c) and (d).
Definition of "Racketeering Activity" - 18 U.S.C. § 1961
18 U.S.C. § 1961 defines "racketeering activity" to include:
"(B) any act which is indictable under any of the following provisions of title
18, United States Code: ... section 1341 (relating to mail fraud), section
1343 (relating to wire fraud), section 1344 (relating to financial institution
fraud), ... section 1956 (relating to the laundering of monetary instruments),
section 1957 (relating to engaging in monetary transactions in property
derived from specified unlawful activity)..."
Furthermore, a "'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts
of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective date of this
chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding any
period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of racketeering
activity."

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The definition encompasses acts such as mail fraud, wire fraud, and
fraudulent monetary transactions, which may encompass the described
activities of filing false documents, transferring money across state lines,
and emptying a joint marital bank account under deceptive pretenses.
Civil Remedies - 18 U.S.C. § 1964
18 U.S.C. § 1964 provides civil remedies for RICO violations:
"Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of
section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate United
States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and
the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee..."
This section establishes the right of the husband to bring a civil RICO claim
if he can demonstrate injury to his business or property as a result of the
defendants' racketeering activities.
Wire Fraud - 18 U.S.C. § 1343
18 U.S.C. § 1343, which may serve as a predicate act for a RICO claim,
states:
"Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to
defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent
pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be
transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in
interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or
sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined
under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both."
If the defendants used interstate wire communications in their scheme to
defraud the husband, this could constitute wire fraud and serve as a
predicate act for a RICO claim.
Interstate Travel in Aid of Racketeering - 18 U.S.C. § 1952
18 U.S.C. § 1952 potentially applies to the scenario:
"Whoever travels in interstate or foreign commerce or uses the mail or any
facility in interstate or foreign commerce, with intent to- distribute the
proceeds of any unlawful activity; or commit any crime of violence to further
any unlawful activity; or otherwise promote, manage, establish, carry on, or
facilitate the promotion, management, establishment, or carrying on, of any
unlawful activity..."
The transfer of money across state lines to further the fraudulent scheme
could potentially violate this provision and serve as a predicate act for a
RICO claim.

Case Law Interpreting RICO Elements
Elements of a Civil RICO Claim
In Bustos v. Invierte En Tex., 4:22-CV-02690 (S.D. Tex. Jun 03, 2024), the
court summarized the essential elements of a civil RICO claim:
"To state a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962, a plaintiff must allege
three common elements: '(1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern of
racketeering activity, (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment,
conduct, or control of an enterprise.'"
Similarly, Cedra Pharmacy Houston, LLC v. UnitedHealth Grp., Inc., CIVIL
ACTION NO. H-17-3800 (S.D. Tex. Mar 07, 2019) explained:
"A plaintiff in a civil action may recover damages under the RICO statute, 18
U.S.C. § 1961, et seq., if he is able to allege and prove: 1) a violation of 18
U.S.C. § 1962(a), (b), (c), or (d), and 2) injury to business or property as a
result of such violation."
Pattern of Racketeering Activity
Allstate Ins. Co. v. Donovan, CIVIL ACTION NO. H-12-0432 (S.D. Tex. Jul 03,
2012) clarified:
"'A pattern of racketeering activity consists of two or more predicate
criminal acts that are (1) related and (2) amount to or pose a threat of
continued criminal activity.'"
The court further noted that "predicate acts can be either state or federal
crimes."
Heden v. Hill, 937 F.Supp. 1230 (S.D. Tex. 1996) elaborated on the continuity
requirement:
"The predicate acts must 'amount to or threaten continuing racketeering
activity.'"
The secondary source Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024-01-01)
emphasized that:
"A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded."
Nexus to Interstate Commerce
Trevino v. Pechero, 592 F.Supp.2d 939 (S.D. Tex. 2008) highlighted:

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
"Because RICO is a federal statute, the racketeering must have at least a
minimal nexus with interstate commerce."
Another source, RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31), explained:
"Notably, there must be some nexus to interstate or foreign commerce—it is
a jurisdictional element of a civil RICO claim. Thus, predicate acts will often
occur in several States."
Conspiracy Between Spouses
Federal criminal conspiracy (1998-03-22) addressed an important point
relevant to this case:
"The legal fiction that a husband and wife are one person in the eyes of the
law has been abandoned for the purposes of [sections] 371. Thus, a husband
and wife are legally capable of conspiring with each other."
This principle applies to the scenario where someone's wife conspired with a
defendant to defraud the husband.
Pleading Requirements for Fraud-Based RICO Claims
Xenos Yuen v. Triple B Servs. LLP, CIVIL ACTION NO. H-18-3277 (S.D. Tex.
Jun 08, 2019) outlined heightened pleading standards:
"Predicate acts supporting a civil RICO claim, which are based on
allegations of fraud, must meet the pleading requirements of FED. R. CIV. P.
9(b)... In the civil RICO context, Rule 9(b) also requires the plaintiff to allege
specifically how each act of mail or wire fraud furthered the fraudulent
scheme, who caused what to be mailed or wired when, and how the mailing
or wiring furthered the fraudulent scheme."
Analysis
Application of RICO Elements to the Given Scenario
Person Engaging in Racketeering Activities
The first element requires identifying persons who engaged in the alleged
racketeering activities. In this case, there are at least two persons: the
defendant in Oklahoma and someone's wife in Texas. These individuals
allegedly conspired to defraud the husband of his property interests through
various fraudulent activities.
Pattern of Racketeering Activity
For a pattern of racketeering activity, the husband would need to identify at
least two qualifying predicate acts that occurred within ten years of each

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
other. Based on the scenario described, several potential predicate acts can
be identified:
Filing documents with false statements in Texas courts - This could
constitute mail or wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 or 1343 if the U.S.
mail or interstate wire communications were used to file these
documents.
Transferring money across state lines as part of the fraudulent scheme
- This could potentially violate 18 U.S.C. § 1957 (engaging in monetary
transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity) if the
money was derived from unlawful activity and exceeded $10,000.
Emptying the joint marital bank account under deceptive pretenses -
This could constitute wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 if interstate
wire communications were used in the process.
Preparing a false affidavit of inability to pay in Oklahoma to be
presented to Texas courts - This could constitute mail or wire fraud if
these interstate communications were used to submit the false affidavit.
Filing a divorce petition with false claims about an active protective
order - This could constitute mail or wire fraud if interstate
communications were used in the filing process.
As explained in Allstate Ins. Co. v. Donovan, CIVIL ACTION NO. H-12-0432
(S.D. Tex. Jul 03, 2012), these acts must be related and "amount to or pose a
threat of continued criminal activity." The acts described appear related as
they all form part of a coordinated scheme to defraud the husband of his
property interests. They also demonstrate a level of continuity, as they
involve multiple fraudulent activities carried out over time as part of an
ongoing scheme.
The secondary source RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31) explains that continuity
can be demonstrated by showing either:
"Closed-ended continuity. Proving 'a series of related predicate acts
extending over a substantial period of time.'"
"Open-ended continuity. A threat of 'continuing criminal activity
extending indefinitely into the future,' in light of the nature of the
enterprise and predicate acts alleged."
The alleged scheme, involving multiple fraudulent acts over time, could
potentially satisfy the closed-ended continuity requirement.
Connection to an Enterprise
The third element requires showing a connection to an enterprise. Under
RICO, an "enterprise" is broadly defined and can include "an individual or
legal entity, or a union or group of individuals associated in fact although not
a legal entity." The association between the defendant and the wife, working
together to defraud the husband, could potentially constitute an
"association-in-fact" enterprise for RICO purposes. Their coordinated actions

3. 
4. 
5. 
• 
• 

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
across state lines suggest a structured relationship with the common
purpose of defrauding the husband.
Nexus to Interstate Commerce
As highlighted in Trevino v. Pechero, 592 F.Supp.2d 939 (S.D. Tex. 2008),
RICO requires "at least a minimal nexus with interstate commerce." This
requirement appears to be satisfied in this case, as the activities involved:
Coordination between individuals in different states (Oklahoma and
Texas)
Transferring money across state lines
Preparing documents in one state (Oklahoma) to be presented in
another state's courts (Texas)
These interstate activities provide a clear nexus to interstate commerce,
satisfying this jurisdictional requirement for a RICO claim.
Injury to Business or Property
For a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1964, the plaintiff must
demonstrate injury to business or property resulting from the RICO
violation. The scenario indicates that the husband was "removed from his
home which is also his place of business." This suggests injury to both his
property interests (loss of home) and business interests (loss of place of
business). Additionally, the emptying of the joint marital bank account
represents a direct financial injury.
As stated in Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024-01-01):
"In the context of a civil action, a plaintiff must be directly injured by reason
of the defendant's racketeering activities. Proximate cause, as an aspect of
RICO's 'by reason of' standard, requires a RICO plaintiff to show that the
defendant's racketeering offenses led directly to the plaintiff's injuries."
The husband's injuries—loss of property, place of business, and financial
assets—appear to be direct consequences of the alleged racketeering
activities, thus potentially satisfying this requirement.
Conspiracy Under RICO
The scenario explicitly mentions a conspiracy between the defendant and
someone's wife. This could potentially support a claim under 18 U.S.C. §
1962(d), which prohibits conspiring to violate other RICO provisions.
Importantly, Federal criminal conspiracy (1998-03-22) clarifies that "a
husband and wife are legally capable of conspiring with each other."
Although the scenario involves a third-party defendant conspiring with
someone's wife (not a husband conspiring with his own wife), this principle
confirms that there is no legal barrier to recognizing a conspiracy involving
a spouse as a co-conspirator.
1. 
2. 
3. 

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Federal criminal conspiracy (2007-03-22) further emphasizes that
"conspiracy is entirely separate from completed substantive offense
completed pursuant to the conspiracy, and its appropriately punished as a
separate offense." This means that even if some aspects of the scheme were
not fully realized, the conspiracy itself could constitute a RICO violation
under § 1962(d).
Potential Challenges and Limitations
Pleading Requirements
As noted in Xenos Yuen v. Triple B Servs. LLP, CIVIL ACTION NO. H-18-3277
(S.D. Tex. Jun 08, 2019), RICO claims based on fraud are subject to
heightened pleading requirements under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
9(b). The husband would need to "allege specifically how each act of mail or
wire fraud furthered the fraudulent scheme, who caused what to be mailed
or wired when, and how the mailing or wiring furthered the fraudulent
scheme." This requires detailed factual allegations that may be challenging
to establish without substantial evidence of the defendants' communications
and actions.
Proving an Enterprise
While the coordination between the defendant and the wife suggests an
association-in-fact enterprise, the husband would need to demonstrate that
this association had sufficient structure to qualify as an enterprise under
RICO. This requires showing that the association had a purpose,
relationships among those associated with the enterprise, and longevity
sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose.
Establishing Continuity
To establish a pattern of racketeering activity, the husband would need to
show that the predicate acts were not isolated events but rather part of a
pattern showing continuity. If the scheme was short-lived or consisted of a
single fraudulent transaction with multiple parts, it might be more difficult
to establish the necessary continuity.
RECONCEIVING COERCION-BASED CRIMINAL DEFENSES (2022-03-22)
notes that continuity can refer to "either to a closed period of repeated
conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a
threat of repetition." If the fraudulent activities occurred over a limited
period with no threat of continuing, this could potentially undermine the
continuity requirement.
Proving Causation
For a civil RICO claim, the husband would need to establish that his injuries
were caused "by reason of" the RICO violation. This requires showing both
actual and proximate causation—that the defendants' racketeering activities

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
directly caused his injuries. If there are intervening causes or if some of the
injuries cannot be directly linked to the alleged racketeering activities, this
could limit the scope of recoverable damages.
Conclusion
Based on the statutory framework and case law interpretation of RICO
requirements, the scenario described potentially supports a civil RICO
claim. The actions of the defendant in Oklahoma and someone's wife in
Texas appear to constitute multiple predicate acts that could establish a
pattern of racketeering activity. Their coordinated efforts across state lines
to defraud the husband of his property interests through false documents,
interstate money transfers, and false court filings suggest a structured
association-in-fact enterprise with a clear nexus to interstate commerce.
The husband's injuries—being removed from his home/place of business and
losing financial assets from the joint marital account—represent direct harm
to his business and property interests that could provide standing for a civil
RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1964.
However, the success of such a claim would depend on the specific details
and evidence available to support each element of a RICO violation:
Proving that the defendants engaged in at least two qualifying
predicate acts (e.g., mail fraud, wire fraud, or financial transactions in
criminally derived property)
Demonstrating that these acts were related and continuous, forming a
pattern of racketeering activity
Establishing that the defendants constituted or were associated with an
enterprise
Showing a sufficient nexus to interstate commerce
Proving that the husband's injuries were directly caused by the
defendants' racketeering activities
If these elements can be established with sufficient evidence, the husband
would potentially have grounds for a civil RICO claim that could entitle him
to treble damages, costs, and attorney's fees under 18 U.S.C. § 1964.
The interstate nature of the alleged activities—spanning Oklahoma and
Texas—and the use of false documents in court proceedings, combined with
interstate financial transactions, provide a strong foundation for such a
claim. However, the husband would need to meet the heightened pleading
requirements for fraud-based RICO claims and be prepared to address
potential challenges to establishing continuity and enterprise elements.

Extract
In 1970, Congress enacted RICO as Title IX of the Organized Crime Control
Act to combat organized crime through both criminal prosecutions and
private actions. See 18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq. ... Under RICO, while four
distinct offenses are declared to be unlawful, common elements are present
in all four offenses. ... Under § 1961(1)(B), racketeering activity includes any
act which is indictable under a number of federal criminal statutes,
including mail fraud and wire fraud. ... For mail fraud, it is necessary to
show that (1) the defendants formed a scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) the
defendants used the United States mails or caused a use of the United
States mails in furtherance of the scheme; and (3) the defendants did so
with the specific intent to deceive or defraud. ... A RICO claim asserting mail
fraud as a predicate act must allege how each specific act of mail fraud
actually furthered the fraudulent scheme, who caused what to be mailed
when, and how the mailing furthered the fraudulent scheme. ... A 'pattern of
racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering activity
within a ten-year period. ... The predicate acts must 'amount to or threaten
continuing racketeering activity.'
Summary
Elements necessary to prove mail fraud, which could be relevant if the
fraudulent scheme involved the use of mail or wire communications.
Additionally, the passage emphasizes the need for continuity in the
racketeering activity, either through repeated conduct or conduct that poses
a future threat of repetition.

A plaintiff in a civil action may recover damages under the RICO statute, 18
U.S.C. § 1961, et seq., if he is able to allege and prove: 1) a violation of 18

result of such violation. 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) ('Any person injured in his
business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter
may sue therefor in any appropriate United States district court. .. ').
Section 1962, as interpreted by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, provides
in its simplest terms, that: Crowe v. Henry, 43 F.3d 198, 203 (5th Cir. 1995).

are delineated in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), and include, for purposes of this case,
extortion. To set out a pattern of predicate acts, a plaintiff must demonstrate
that the predicate acts are related and that such acts have some type of
continuity. Id.
Summary
A pattern of racketeering requires at least two acts of racketeering activity,
which can include extortion. The plaintiff must also show that these acts are
related and continuous. In the scenario described in the question, if the
actions of the defendant and the wife meet these criteria, such as through
acts of fraud and extortion, and if these actions resulted in injury to the
husband's business or property, it could potentially open up a RICO claim.

RICO provides civil causes of action for recovery of treble damages for '[a]ny
person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section
1962 of this chapter.' 18 U.S.C. § 1964 (c). Plaintiffs have alleged that
defendants have violated §§ 1962(c) and (d). These subsections state: 18
U.S.C. §§ 1962(c) and (d). The Fifth Circuit has interpreted these subsections
to mean that 'a person who is employed by or associated with an enterprise
cannot conduct the affairs of the enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity[, and that] a person cannot conspire to violate
subsection[]. .. (c).' ... 'A pattern of racketeering activity consists of two or

18 U.S.C. § 1961(5) ('pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two
acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective date
of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years. .. after the
commission of a prior act of racketeering activity'). Predicate acts can be
either state or federal crimes. Id.
Summary
For a RICO claim to be valid, there must be a pattern of racketeering
activity, which consists of at least two predicate criminal acts that are
related and pose a threat of continued criminal activity. These predicate acts
can be state or federal crimes. The passage also clarifies that a person
cannot conduct the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering
activity or conspire to do so. The passage provides insight into the
requirements for establishing a RICO claim, which is relevant to the
question of whether the described actions could constitute a RICO violation.

18 U.S.C. § 1343 18 U.S.C. § 1343 Fraud By Wire, Radio, Or Television
Extract
Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to
defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent
pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be
transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in
interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or
sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined
under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1343 addresses schemes to defraud using interstate wire
communications. The scenario described in the question involves
transmitting false documents and transferring money across state lines,
which could potentially fall under this statute if wire communications were
used in the process. This statute is relevant to the question as it provides a
basis for federal charges related to wire fraud, which is often a predicate
offense for a RICO claim.

Extract
It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of racketeering activity
or through collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or maintain, directly or
indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or
the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce. ... It shall be
unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of the provisions of
subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section.
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1962 makes it unlawful for any person to engage in a pattern of
racketeering activity or to conspire to do so, especially when such activities
affect interstate commerce. The scenario described involves potential
racketeering activities, such as fraud and conspiracy, which are intended to
defraud a person of property interests and involve interstate elements (e.g.,
transferring money across state lines). These actions could potentially fall
under the purview of RICO if they constitute a pattern of racketeering
activity.
18 U.S.C. § 1961 18 U.S.C. § 1961 Definitions
Extract
As used in this chapter- 'racketeering activity' means ... (B) any act which is
indictable under any of the following provisions of title 18, United States
Code: ... section 1341 (relating to mail fraud), section 1343 (relating to wire
fraud), section 1344 (relating to financial institution fraud), ... section 1956
(relating to the laundering of monetary instruments), section 1957 (relating
to engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified
unlawful activity), ... 'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two
acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective date
of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding
any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of
racketeering activity;
Summary
The definition of "racketeering activity" includes acts indictable under
sections related to fraud (mail, wire, financial institution) and money
laundering. The passage also defines a "pattern of racketeering activity" as
requiring at least two acts of racketeering activity within a specified
timeframe. This is relevant to the question as the described actions could
potentially fall under these definitions if they involve fraud and monetary
transactions across state lines.

Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1964 outlines the civil remedies available for
violations of section 1962, which deals with racketeering activities. It states
that any person injured in their business or property due to such a violation
can sue in a U.S. district court and recover threefold the damages sustained,
along with the cost of the suit and reasonable attorney's fees. This is
relevant to the question as it suggests that if the actions described
(conspiracy, fraud, and interstate money transfer) constitute a pattern of
racketeering activity under section 1962, the injured party (the husband)
may have grounds for a RICO claim.
18 U.S.C. § 1952 18 U.S.C. § 1952 Interstate and Foreign Travel Or
Transportation In Aid of Racketeering Enterprises
Extract
Whoever travels in interstate or foreign commerce or uses the mail or any
facility in interstate or foreign commerce, with intent to- distribute the
proceeds of any unlawful activity; or commit any crime of violence to further
any unlawful activity; or otherwise promote, manage, establish, carry on, or
facilitate the promotion, management, establishment, or carrying on, of any
unlawful activity, and thereafter performs or attempts to perform- (A) an act
described in paragraph or shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not
more than 5 years, or both; or (B) an act described in paragraph shall be
fined under this title, imprisoned for not more than 20 years, or both, and if
death results shall be imprisoned for any term of years or for life.
Summary
Using interstate commerce to distribute proceeds of unlawful activity or to
promote or manage unlawful activity can lead to fines and imprisonment.
This is relevant to the scenario described in the question, where the
defendants used interstate commerce (transferring money across state lines)
to facilitate fraudulent activities.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Whoever violates any provision of section 1962 of this chapter shall be fined
under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years (or for life if the
violation is based on a racketeering activity for which the maximum penalty
includes life imprisonment), or both, and shall forfeit to the United States,
irrespective of any provision of State law- any interest the person has
acquired or maintained in violation of section 1962; any-(A) interest in; (B)
security of; (C) claim against; or (D) property or contractual right of any
kind affording a source of influence over; any enterprise which the person
has established, operated, controlled, conducted, or participated in the
conduct of, in violation of section 1962; and any property constituting, or
derived from, any proceeds which the person obtained, directly or indirectly,
from racketeering activity or unlawful debt collection in violation of section
1962.
Summary
Penalties for violating section 1962, which involves racketeering activities. It
specifies that individuals involved in such activities can face significant
fines, imprisonment, and forfeiture of any interests or property obtained
through the racketeering activity. The context of the question involves a
scheme to defraud, which could potentially fall under racketeering if it
involves a pattern of illegal activity as defined under section 1962. The
passage is relevant as it provides the legal framework for penalties and
forfeiture related to racketeering activities, which could apply to the
described scenario if it meets the criteria of a RICO violation.
18 U.S.C. § 1957 18 U.S.C. § 1957 Engaging In Monetary Transactions In
Property Derived From Specified Unlawful Activity
Extract
Whoever, in any of the circumstances set forth in subsection (d), knowingly
engages or attempts to engage in a monetary transaction in criminally
derived property of a value greater than $10,000 and is derived from
specified unlawful activity, shall be punished as provided in subsection (b).
Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1957 addresses the criminal liability for
engaging in monetary transactions involving property derived from specified
unlawful activities. The statute specifies that knowingly engaging in such
transactions, particularly when the value exceeds $10,000, is punishable
under federal law. This is relevant to the question as it involves the transfer
of money across state lines, which could be considered a monetary
transaction in criminally derived property if the funds were obtained
through fraudulent means. The statute does not require the government to
prove that the defendant knew the property was derived from specified

The legal fiction that a husband and wife are one person in the eyes of the
law has been abandoned for the purposes of [sections] 371. Thus, a husband

Summary
Under U.S. federal law, specifically section 371, a husband and wife can
legally conspire with each other. This is relevant to the question as it
involves a conspiracy between a defendant and someone's wife. The passage
supports the notion that such a conspiracy is legally recognized, which is a
critical element in considering a RICO claim.

Summary
Conspiracy is a separate offense from the substantive crime that results
from it. It emphasizes that conspiracy involves an agreement to commit an
unlawful act, which is the core of the crime. Additionally, it notes that a
husband and wife can legally conspire with each other, which is relevant to
the scenario described in the question. This information is crucial in
understanding the potential for a RICO claim, as RICO often involves
proving a pattern of racketeering activity, which can include conspiracy.

A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity...
Section 1961(1) outlines the definition of “racketeering activity” and
enumerates various predicate acts that can establish a pattern of
racketeering. These predicate acts encompass a wide range of criminal
activities, including but not limited to mail fraud, wire fraud, bribery,
extortion, and money laundering... RICO’s prohibitions may be enforced in
both criminal and civil contexts. In the context of a civil action, a plaintiff
must be directly injured by reason of the defendant’s racketeering activities.
Proximate cause, as an aspect of RICO’s “by reason of ” standard, requires a
RICO plaintiff to show that the defendant’s racketeering offenses led directly
to the plaintiff ’s injuries.
Summary
Framework for understanding the elements required to plead a RICO claim,
emphasizing the need for particularity in allegations of fraud and the
necessity of demonstrating proximate cause.

Extract
The Court formalized a two-step framework for analyzing the extraterritorial
application of a statute (1) the presumption against extraterritoriality can
only be rebutted if the statute provides a clear indication that Congress
intended it to apply abroad, and (2) if there is no indication of
extraterritoriality, the conduct in the case must evidence a domestic
application of the statute. Regarding RICO specifically, the Court held that
the racketeering statute may have extraterritorial effect, 'but only to the
extent that the predicates alleged in a particular case themselves apply
extraterritoriality.'

Summary
RICO can have extraterritorial effect if the predicates alleged in a particular
case themselves apply extraterritorially. This suggests that if the actions in
question involve predicates that have extraterritorial application, a RICO
claim could potentially be made.
RECONCEIVING COERCION-BASED CRIMINAL DEFENSES.
Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology - Northwestern University,
School of Law - Galoob, Stephen R. - 2022-03-22
Extract
The inquiry here is meant to invoke the 'pattern of racketeering activity'
element of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
The Organized Crime Control Act (1970), which includes RICO, provides that
'criminal conduct forms a pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events.' The Supreme Court characterized this
requirement as a 'relationship' element and held that the statute further
requires a 'continuity' element, 'referring either to a closed period of
repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition.'
Summary
The passage explains the requirements for establishing a "pattern of
racketeering activity" under RICO. It highlights that criminal conduct must
form a pattern if it involves acts with similar purposes, results, participants,
victims, or methods of commission, or if they are interrelated by
distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events. Additionally, the
Supreme Court requires a "continuity" element, which refers to either a
closed period of repeated conduct or past conduct that projects into the
future with a threat of repetition. This information is relevant to determining
whether the actions described in the question could constitute a RICO claim.

prove most types of RICO claims, the plaintiff must plead that the defendant
committed some qualifying criminal action, the most common of which is
mail, wire or securities fraud. ... Third, the plaintiff must plead a pattern of
racketeering activity for most RICO claims. If the alleged conduct occurred
once or twice, or was not continuous, it cannot form a pattern of conduct
sufficient to support a RICO claim. ... Fifth, a RICO claim cannot exist
without some nexus to interstate commerce. If the alleged conduct does not
affect interstate commerce, it must be dismissed.
Summary
Requirements for a RICO claim, including the need for an "enterprise" and a
"pattern of racketeering activity," which involves long-term, organized
conduct that violates state and federal laws. It also highlights the necessity
of proving a qualifying criminal action, such as mail or wire fraud, and the
requirement for a pattern of racketeering activity, which must be continuous
and not isolated. Additionally, there must be a nexus to interstate commerce
for a RICO claim to be valid.

Extract
RICO is not a simple statute. It pertains to conduct associated with an
'enterprise' and 'a pattern racketeering activity.' An enterprise is an
individual or legal entity, or a union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity, while a pattern of racketeering activity requires
long-term, organized conduct to violate state and federal laws. There are
four types of activities outlawed by RICO, and claims under Section 1962(c)
are the most commonly asserted: * Section 1962(a) prohibits a person from
investing in an enterprise any income derived from a pattern of racketeering
activity; * Section 1962(b) prohibits a person from using a pattern of
racketeering activity to acquire or maintain control over an enterprise; *
Section 1962(c) prohibits a person from conducting the affairs of an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering; and * Section 1962(d)
prohibits a person from conspiring to violate Sections 1962(a), (b), or (c).
Summary
Types of activities prohibited under RICO, including conducting the affairs of
an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering and conspiring to violate
these provisions. The scenario described in the question involves potential
fraudulent activities and interstate transactions, which could potentially
meet the criteria for a RICO claim if they constitute a pattern of
racketeering activity and involve an enterprise as defined by the statute.

separate and distinct RICO violations set out in section 1962: (a) acquiring

enterprise using racketeering activities; (c) conducting the affairs of an
enterprise using racketeering activities; and (d) conspiring to so acquire,
control, or conduct.
Summary
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) allows for
civil action against individuals engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity.
The passage outlines that a pattern of racketeering activity can be
established with two or more offenses occurring over a period of time, and
there must be a nexus to interstate commerce. The described scenario
involves multiple fraudulent acts, including filing false documents and
transferring money across state lines, which could potentially constitute a
pattern of racketeering activity. Additionally, the passage mentions that
RICO violations include conspiring to conduct an enterprise through
racketeering activities, which aligns with the described conspiracy to
defraud the husband.

Summary
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) allows for
civil action against individuals engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity.
The passage outlines that a pattern of racketeering activity can be
established by demonstrating a series of related predicate acts that either
extend over a substantial period of time (closed-ended continuity) or pose a
threat of continuing indefinitely into the future (open-ended continuity).
Additionally, there must be a nexus to interstate or foreign commerce, which
is relevant in this case as the actions involved transferring money across
state lines. The passage also notes that predicate acts often occur in several
states, which aligns with the scenario described in the question involving
actions in both Oklahoma and Texas.
