Question
The complaint identifies multiple predicate acts, including wire fraud, mail
fraud, and obstruction of justice, occurring over a period of months and
involving interstate communications and transactions. Under 18 U.S.C. §
1961(5), a "pattern of racketeering activity" requires at least two predicate
acts of racketeering within a 10-year period that are related and pose a
threat of continued criminal activity. The alleged predicate acts, such as
fabricating legal documents, transmitting them via mail and wire, and
obstructing justice through threats and intimidation, constitute a pattern of
racketeering activity as defined by RICO.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5), the alleged predicate acts of wire fraud, mail
fraud, and obstruction of justice occurring over a period of months and
involving interstate communications constitute a pattern of racketeering
activity as defined by RICO. These acts satisfy RICO's requirements because
they include at least two predicate acts of racketeering within a 10-year
period that are related and demonstrate continuity or pose a threat of
continued criminal activity.
Summary
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) was
designed to combat organized crime by creating both criminal and civil
liability for individuals engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity. Under
RICO's statutory framework, a "pattern of racketeering activity" requires at
least two predicate acts of racketeering occurring within a 10-year period.
The Supreme Court has further clarified that these acts must be related and
must amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity, establishing
what is known as the "continuity plus relationship" test.
In this case, the complaint identifies multiple predicate acts including wire
fraud, mail fraud, and obstruction of justice occurring over a period of
months and involving interstate communications and transactions. These
allegations, if proven, would satisfy RICO's statutory requirements for a
pattern of racketeering activity. The acts are related as they appear to be
part of a common scheme involving the fabrication of legal documents, their
transmission via mail and wire, and obstruction of justice through threats
and intimidation. Additionally, these acts demonstrate continuity by
occurring over a period of months, suggesting they are not isolated
incidents but rather indicative of ongoing criminal activity.

Legislative Framework
The RICO statute provides the legislative framework for determining what
constitutes a "pattern of racketeering activity." Under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5), a
"pattern of racketeering activity" is defined as requiring "at least two acts of
racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective date of this
chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding any
period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of racketeering
activity." 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5) (2025).
The statute further defines "racketeering activity" to include numerous
federal and state crimes, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of
justice. 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (2025) states that "'racketeering activity' means...
(B) any act which is indictable under any of the following provisions of title
18, United States Code:... section 1341 (relating to mail fraud), section 1343
(relating to wire fraud),... section 1503 (relating to obstruction of justice)..."
The federal mail fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1341 (2025), prohibits using the
postal service or interstate carriers to execute a scheme to defraud:
"Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to
defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent
pretenses, representations, or promises... for the purpose of executing such
scheme or artifice or attempting so to do, places in any post office or
authorized depository for mail matter, any matter or thing whatever to be
sent or delivered by the Postal Service, or deposits or causes to be deposited
any matter or thing whatever to be sent or delivered by any private or
commercial interstate carrier... shall be fined under this title or imprisoned
not more than 20 years, or both."
Similarly, the wire fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1343 (2025), prohibits using
interstate wire communications to execute such schemes:
"Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to
defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent
pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be
transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in
interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or
sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined
under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both."
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1962 (2025), it is unlawful "for any person through a
pattern of racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt to
acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest in or control of any
enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or
foreign commerce."

Judicial Interpretation of the "Pattern"
Requirement
While the statutory definition requires at least two predicate acts within a
ten-year period, courts have consistently held that this alone is insufficient
to establish a pattern of racketeering activity. The Supreme Court has
played a crucial role in developing this area of law, particularly through its
landmark decision in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S.
229 (1989).
In H.J. Inc., the Supreme Court established that to prove a pattern of
racketeering activity, a plaintiff or prosecutor must show both "relationship"
and "continuity" – that the racketeering predicates are related, and that they
either constitute or threaten long-term criminal activity. The Court stated:
"RICO's legislative history, however, establishes that Congress intended that
to prove a 'pattern of racketeering activity' a plaintiff or prosecutor must
show both 'relationship' and 'continuity'—that the racketeering predicates
are related, and that they either constitute or threaten long-term criminal
activity." H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229, 109
S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989).
This "continuity plus relationship" test has been consistently applied by
lower courts. For example, in Nutrition Distribution LLC v. Custom
Nutraceuticals LLC, 194 F.Supp.3d 952 (D. Ariz. 2016), the court reiterated
that a "'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of
racketeering activity, § 1961(5), which must be 'related' and 'amount to or
pose a threat of continued criminal activity.'"
Similarly, the Third Circuit in In re Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 618
F.3d 300 (3rd Cir. 2010) stated: "According to the RICO statute, a 'pattern of
racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering activity
within a ten-year period. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). 'These predicate acts of
racketeering may include, inter alia, federal mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. §
1341 or federal wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343.'"
The Second Circuit in U.S. v. Pizzonia, 577 F.3d 455 (2nd Cir. 2009)
emphasized that RICO was concerned with long-term criminal conduct,
noting that the pattern element "serves to ensure that a defendant's criminal
participation in an enterprise is not merely isolated or sporadic, but
indicative of the sort of continuity of criminal activity —or the threat of
continuity—that is the hallmark of racketeering."
The Eighth Circuit in Wisdom v. First Midwest Bank, of Poplar Bluff, 167 F.
3d 402 (8th Cir. 1999) further clarified that "a mere allegation of two or
more acts is insufficient to state a RICO claim; the predicate acts must be
related and must 'amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.'"
Relationship Requirement
The "relationship" prong of the pattern test requires that the predicate acts
have similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
commission, or otherwise be interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
rather than being isolated events.
In U.S. v. Workman, 80 F.3d 688 (2nd Cir. 1996), the court upheld a jury
instruction that made clear that "the two racketeering acts with which
[defendant] was charged had to be interrelated and had to pose a threat of
continued racketeering activity in order to satisfy RICO's 'pattern'
requirement."
The "relationship" requirement is further illustrated in U.S. v. Teitler, 802 F.
2d 606 (2nd Cir. 1986), where the court stated that "the predicate acts must
have been connected with each other by some common scheme, plan or
motive so as to constitute a pattern and not merely a series of disconnected
acts."
Continuity Requirement
The "continuity" prong of the pattern test can be satisfied through either
"closed-ended continuity" or "open-ended continuity." As explained in a RICO
primer cited in the administrative decisions, closed-ended continuity
involves "a series of related predicate acts extending over a substantial
period of time," while open-ended continuity involves "a threat of 'continuing
criminal activity extending indefinitely into the future,' in light of the nature
of the enterprise and predicate acts alleged." RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31).
In Banks v. Wolk, 918 F.2d 418 (3rd Cir. 1990), the court referenced the
Supreme Court's H.J. Inc. decision, noting that a plaintiff must show that
"the racketeering acts are related, and that they amount to or pose a threat
of continued criminal activity." The court further emphasized that RICO was
concerned with long-term criminal conduct rather than isolated or sporadic
criminal acts.
The temporal aspect of continuity was discussed in Ashland Oil, Inc. v.
Arnett, 875 F.2d 1271 (7th Cir. 1989), where the court noted that a pattern
requires at least two acts of racketeering activity within a ten-year period.
The court also suggested that the use of "several unlawful means of
achieving the scheme's goal" could distinguish a RICO case from ordinary
fraud cases.
Application to the Current Case
Based on the legislative framework and judicial interpretations outlined
above, the alleged predicate acts in the complaint—wire fraud, mail fraud,
and obstruction of justice occurring over a period of months and involving
interstate communications and transactions—would likely constitute a
"pattern of racketeering activity" as defined by RICO.
Statutory Requirements
First, the alleged acts are explicitly listed as "racketeering activity" under 18
U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B), which includes mail fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341), wire fraud

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
(18 U.S.C. § 1343), and obstruction of justice (18 U.S.C. § 1503) as predicate
acts.
Second, the complaint alleges multiple predicate acts, satisfying the
requirement of "at least two acts of racketeering activity" under 18 U.S.C. §
1961(5). These acts are alleged to have occurred within a period of months,
well within the ten-year period specified by the statute.
Relationship Requirement
The alleged predicate acts appear to be related as they are described as part
of a common scheme involving the fabrication of legal documents, their
transmission via mail and wire, and obstruction of justice through threats
and intimidation. This suggests a common purpose, similar methods of
commission, and potentially the same participants and victims.
Courts have recognized that acts involving mail and wire fraud can be
related even if they arise from a common set of facts. In Beth Israel Medical
Center v. Smith, 576 F.Supp. 1061 (S.D. N.Y. 1983), the court rejected the
argument that predicate acts must occur in different factual situations,
stating: "Movants' contention that separate acts of mail and wire fraud
arising out of a common nucleus of facts cannot be considered separate
predicate RICO acts is without merit... First, the plain language of the
statute refers to 'any act which is indictable' under the mail or wire fraud
statutes, without a qualification that each act must occur in a different
factual situation. Second, it would contradict the requirement of a 'pattern
of racketeering activity' to hold that the acts making up the pattern must
take place in unconnected factual circumstances."
Continuity Requirement
The alleged acts occurring over a period of months suggest a pattern of
ongoing criminal activity rather than isolated incidents. This temporal
spread supports the "closed-ended continuity" approach to satisfying the
continuity requirement.
Furthermore, the nature of the alleged acts—fabricating legal documents,
transmitting them via mail and wire, and obstructing justice through threats
and intimidation—suggests a coordinated and ongoing scheme that could
pose a threat of continued criminal activity, potentially supporting "open-
ended continuity" as well.
Multiple Predicate Acts
The complaint specifically identifies multiple types of predicate acts—wire
fraud, mail fraud, and obstruction of justice. Courts have recognized that the
use of multiple types of unlawful activities can help establish a pattern of
racketeering.
In United HealthCare Corp. v. American Trade Ins. Co., Ltd., 88 F.3d 563
(8th Cir. 1996), the court noted that the predicate acts of mail and wire
fraud are established through proof of "(1) a scheme to defraud; (2) intent to

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
defraud; (3) reasonable foreseeability that the mails (or wires) would be
used; and (4) use of the mails (or wires) in furtherance of the scheme."
In Arizona Premium Finance, Inc. v. Bielli, 77 F.Supp.2d 341 (E.D. N.Y.
1999), the court reiterated that a pattern requires at least two acts of
racketeering occurring within ten years of each other, and specifically
mentioned mail and wire fraud as examples of predicate acts under 18
U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B).
The inclusion of obstruction of justice among the alleged predicate acts adds
another dimension to the pattern. In D'Addario v. Geller, 264 F.Supp.2d 367
(E.D. Va. 2003), the court noted that "racketeering must involve the
commission of two or more predicate acts, including mail fraud and
obstruction of justice" and referenced a case where the plaintiff "alleges
multiple predicate acts of mail fraud and at least one predicate act of
obstruction of justice."
Interstate Commerce Connection
The complaint's reference to "interstate communications and transactions"
is significant as it connects the alleged pattern of racketeering activity to
interstate commerce, which is a jurisdictional requirement under RICO. As
stated in Nutrition Distribution LLC v. Custom Nutraceuticals LLC, 194
F.Supp.3d 952 (D. Ariz. 2016), RICO makes it unlawful for "any person
employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in...interstate or
foreign commerce, to conduct or participate...in the conduct of such
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity."
Potential Challenges and Limitations
Despite the strength of the claim that the alleged acts constitute a pattern of
racketeering activity, there are potential challenges and limitations to
consider.
Pleading Requirements
Courts often require heightened pleading standards for RICO claims,
particularly those involving mail and wire fraud as predicate acts. In Goren
v. New Vision Intern., Inc., 156 F.3d 721 (7th Cir. 1998), the court noted that
"a plaintiff alleging predicate acts of mail and wire fraud must do so with
particularity. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b)." It should be noted that this case has
been stated as abrogated by Griffin v. UW Sys. Bd. of Regents, 19-cv-277-bbc
(W.D. Wis. Oct 16, 2019), although the specific pleading requirements for
fraud under Rule 9(b) remain valid.
Similarly, in Mowett v. Jpmorgan Chase Bank, Case No. 15-12612 (E.D. Mich.
Mar 31, 2016), the court outlined the requirements for establishing RICO
violations. However, this case was stated as abrogated by Fuller v. Select
Portfolio Servicing, Inc., Case No. 1:19-cv-28 (W.D. Mich. Mar 02, 2021).
While we can still consider the general principles stated in Mowett, we must
do so with caution given this subsequent treatment.

Duration and Extent of Activity
While the complaint alleges acts occurring over a period of "months," courts
have sometimes required longer periods to establish closed-ended
continuity. The specific duration required varies by circuit, but a period of
months might be considered relatively short in some jurisdictions.
Relatedness of Predicate Acts
If the predicate acts can be characterized as isolated or disconnected events
rather than part of a common scheme or plan, this could undermine the
"relationship" prong of the pattern requirement.
Conclusion
Based on the legislative framework provided by 18 U.S.C. § 1961-1968 and
the extensive judicial interpretations of those provisions, the alleged
predicate acts of wire fraud, mail fraud, and obstruction of justice occurring
over a period of months and involving interstate communications and
transactions would likely constitute a "pattern of racketeering activity" as
defined by RICO.
The alleged acts satisfy the statutory requirement of at least two predicate
acts of racketeering activity occurring within a ten-year period. Moreover,
they appear to meet the judicially-created "continuity plus relationship" test
established by the Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. and consistently applied by
lower courts.
The acts are related as they allegedly involve a common scheme of
fabricating legal documents, transmitting them via mail and wire, and
obstructing justice through threats and intimidation. They demonstrate
continuity by occurring over a period of months, suggesting an ongoing
pattern rather than isolated incidents.
The fact that the alleged acts include multiple types of predicate offenses—
wire fraud, mail fraud, and obstruction of justice—further supports the
existence of a pattern of racketeering activity. Additionally, the involvement
of interstate communications and transactions establishes the necessary
connection to interstate commerce required by RICO.
While potential challenges exist regarding pleading standards and the
duration of the alleged activity, the overall weight of the legislative and
judicial authorities supports the conclusion that the alleged acts constitute a
pattern of racketeering activity as defined by RICO.
In sum, the complaint's identification of multiple predicate acts, including
wire fraud, mail fraud, and obstruction of justice, occurring over a period of
months and involving interstate communications and transactions, satisfies
the requirements for a "pattern of racketeering activity" under 18 U.S.C. §
1961(5) and the judicial interpretations of that provision.

The pattern element 'requires at least two acts of racketeering activity.' 18
U.S.C. § 1961(5); see also H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S.
229, 237-38, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989). However, a mere
allegation of two or more acts is insufficient to state a RICO claim; the
predicate acts must be related and must 'amount to or pose a threat of
continued criminal activity.' See United HealthCare Corp. v. American Trade
Ins. Co., Ltd., 88 F.3d 563, 571 (8th Cir.1996) (quoting H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at
239, 109 S.Ct. 2893).
Summary
The passage from the Wisdom v. First Midwest Bank case provides a clear
interpretation of the requirements for establishing a pattern of racketeering
activity under RICO. It confirms that at least two acts of racketeering are
required, and these acts must be related and pose a threat of continued
criminal activity. This directly supports the proposition that the alleged
predicate acts, such as wire fraud and mail fraud, can constitute a pattern of
racketeering activity if they meet these criteria.
U.S. v. Teitler, 802 F.2d 606 (2nd Cir. 1986)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Second Circuit
Extract
A pattern of racketeering activity is committed if the Defendant committed
at least two of the racketeering acts charged against him or her in the
indictment.... In addition [to proving two racketeering acts], the government
must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the predicate acts constituted
part of a larger pattern of activity that characterized each Defendant's
conduct of or participation in the affairs of the law firm. That is to say, the
predicate acts must have been connected with each other by some common
scheme, plan or motive so as to constitute a pattern and not merely a series
of disconnected acts.
Summary
The court in "U.S. v. Teitler" affirmed the requirement that a pattern of
racketeering activity under RICO involves at least two predicate acts that
are connected by a common scheme, plan, or motive. This supports the
proposition by confirming that multiple predicate acts, such as mail fraud

and obstruction of justice, can constitute a pattern if they are part of a
larger scheme.
Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Arnett, 875 F.2d 1271 (7th Cir. 1989)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Seventh Circuit
Extract
A pattern of racketeering activity 'requires at least two acts of racketeering
activity, one of which occurred after [October 15, 1970] and the last of which
occurred within ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment) after the
commission of a prior act of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1961(5).
'Racketeering activity,' in turn, includes any act or threat 'chargeable' under
certain state laws (including arson), and any act 'indictable' under a number
of enumerated federal criminal statutes (including wire and mail fraud, and
bankruptcy fraud). ... The plaintiffs claim that the evidence in Count II was
sufficient under Morgan because it involved 'literally hundreds of predicate
acts' of mail and wire fraud, plus arson and bankruptcy fraud, and because
four victims were injured over a period of time. ... More than the number of
predicate acts, proof that the defendants used several unlawful means of
achieving the scheme's goal separates this case from ordinary business
fraud cases.
Summary
The court in "Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Arnett" discusses the requirements for
establishing a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO. The court
emphasizes that a pattern requires at least two acts of racketeering activity
within a ten-year period and that these acts must be related and pose a
threat of continued criminal activity. The case also highlights that the use of
multiple unlawful means to achieve a scheme's goal can distinguish a RICO
case from ordinary business fraud cases. This supports the proposition that
the alleged predicate acts in the complaint, such as wire fraud, mail fraud,
and obstruction of justice, can constitute a pattern of racketeering activity
under RICO.

(1985)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
RICO takes aim at 'racketeering activity,' which it defines as any act
'chargeable' under several generically described state criminal laws, any act
'indictable' under numerous specific federal criminal provisions, including
mail and wire fraud... Section 1961 defines 'racketeering activity' to mean

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
any of numerous acts 'chargeable' or 'indictable' under enumerated state
and federal laws, including... federal mail and wire fraud statutes... It states
that 'a pattern' of racketeering activity requires proof of at least two acts of
racketeering within 10 years... The definition of 'pattern' may thus logically
be interpreted as meaning that the presence of the predicate acts is only the
beginning: something more is required for a 'pattern' to be proved... The
legislative history supports the view that two isolated acts of racketeering
activity do not constitute a pattern. As the Senate Report explained: 'The
target of [RICO] is thus not sporadic activity... It is this factor of continuity
plus relationship which combines to produce a pattern.'
Summary
RICO defines racketeering activity to include acts indictable under federal
mail and wire fraud statutes. The statute requires at least two acts of
racketeering within a 10-year period to establish a pattern, but these acts
must also demonstrate continuity and relationship to constitute a pattern.
The passage supports the proposition by confirming that the alleged
predicate acts, such as mail and wire fraud, can form a pattern of
racketeering activity if they are related and pose a threat of continued
criminal activity.

Title 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) provides that 'it shall be unlawful for any person
employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities

directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a
pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.' According to
18 U.S.C. § 1961, racketeering must involve the commission of two or more
predicate acts, including mail fraud and obstruction of justice... Plaintiff
alleges multiple predicate acts of mail fraud and at least one predicate act of
obstruction of justice committed by defendant Geller in allegedly making
false statements to this court... The RICO statute itself requires 'at least two'
instances of racketeering activity. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). Two acts are
necessary but not sufficient to establish a pattern of racketeering activity.

between the predicate acts and a threat of continued criminal activity.
Summary
The RICO statute requires at least two predicate acts of racketeering
activity, such as mail fraud and obstruction of justice, to establish a pattern.
The passage also references the Supreme Court's interpretation that these

U.S. v. Welch, 656 F.2d 1039 (5th Cir. 1981)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Engaging in a 'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of
racketeering within a ten-year period. Finally, racketeering activity is
expressly defined to include only certain types of conduct, including acts
indictable under 18 U.S.C.A. § 1511... To be convicted on a section 1962(c)
RICO charge, the evidence must show that the defendant participated in the
affairs of the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. This
requires the commission of at least two predicate crimes... Section 1961(5)
defines 'pattern of racketeering activity' as requiring 'at least two acts of
racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective date of this
chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding any
period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of racketeering
activity.'
Summary
The court in "U.S. v. Welch" outlines the statutory requirements for a pattern
of racketeering activity under RICO. It confirms that at least two predicate
acts within a ten-year period are necessary, and these acts must be related
to the affairs of an enterprise. This directly supports the proposition that the
alleged predicate acts in the complaint, such as wire fraud, mail fraud, and
obstruction of justice, can constitute a pattern of racketeering activity if
they meet these criteria.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Second Circuit
Extract
Two of the RICO counts allege that the fraudulent purchase orders, invoices
and credit memoranda constitute a pattern of racketeering activity, the
predicate acts being separate and numerous violations of the Mail Fraud
Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341 (1982) and the Wire Fraud Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343
(1982)... Section 1964(c) states that anyone 'injured' 'by reason of' a
violation of section 1962 is entitled to treble damages. Section 1962
'violations' include conducting 'enterprises' 'through a pattern of
racketeering'; a 'pattern of racketeering' is defined by section 1961(5) as

Summary
The passage from the Sedima case provides a clear explanation of what
constitutes a "pattern of racketeering activity" under RICO, specifically
referencing the requirement of at least two predicate acts within a ten-year
period as defined by 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). It also highlights that these acts
can include mail and wire fraud, which are relevant to the proposition. The
case further clarifies that a pattern requires more than just isolated acts,
implying a relationship and continuity, which supports the proposition's
assertion of a pattern involving multiple predicate acts over time.

U.S.C. § 1956), mail fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341) and wire fraud (18 U.S.C. §
1343).
Summary
The FBI's investigation found probable cause for predicate acts such as mail
fraud and wire fraud, which are relevant to establishing a pattern of
racketeering activity under RICO. This supports the proposition that such
acts can be part of a RICO charge if they are related and pose a threat of
continued criminal activity.

(D. Ariz. 2016)
U.S. District Court — District of Arizona
Extract
RICO makes it unlawful for 'any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in...interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
participate...in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). 'Racketeering activity' includes
any of several listed crimes 'which is chargeable under State law and
punishable by imprisonment for more than one year,' as well as any act
chargeable under one of several enumerated federal statutes. § 1961(1). A
'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering
activity, § 1961(5), which must be 'related' and 'amount to or pose a threat of
continued criminal activity.'
Summary
The passage provides a clear explanation of what constitutes a "pattern of
racketeering activity" under RICO. It specifies that at least two acts of
racketeering are required, which must be related and pose a threat of
continued criminal activity. This directly supports the proposition by
confirming that the alleged predicate acts, such as wire fraud, mail fraud,
and obstruction of justice, if proven, could constitute a pattern of
racketeering activity as defined by RICO.

'racketeering activity').
Summary
For a RICO claim under § 1962(c), a plaintiff must demonstrate a pattern of
racketeering activity, which requires at least two predicate acts within a ten-
year period. The passage specifically mentions that predicate acts can
include federal mail fraud and wire fraud, which aligns with the
proposition's mention of these acts as part of the alleged racketeering
activity. The passage supports the proposition by confirming that such acts
can constitute a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO.

2016)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Michigan
Extract
To establish a RICO violation under § 1962(c), a plaintiff must allege that the
RICO enterprise engaged in a 'pattern of racketeering activity' consisting of
at least two predicate acts of racketeering activity occurring within a ten-
year period. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). The alleged predicate acts may consist of
offenses 'which are indictable' under any of a number of federal statutes,
including the mail (18 U.S.C. § 1341) and wire fraud statutes (18 U.S.C. §
1343). 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1).
Summary
To establish a RICO violation, a plaintiff must demonstrate a pattern of
racketeering activity, which includes at least two predicate acts within a ten-
year period. The passage specifically mentions that these acts can include
mail and wire fraud, which are relevant to the proposition. The passage
supports the idea that the alleged predicate acts, if they involve mail and
wire fraud, could constitute a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO.

number of criminal acts performed by the persons composing the enterprise.
Turkette, 452 U.S. at 583, 101 S.Ct. at 2528. A pattern requires at least two
criminal activities within ten years. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5) (1984). In addition,
the racketeering predicates must be related and amount to or pose a
continued threat of criminal activity. H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone

Summary
Requirements for establishing a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO,
specifically noting that a pattern requires at least two criminal activities
within ten years that are related and pose a continued threat of criminal
activity. It also identifies mail fraud as a form of racketeering activity. This

To establish such a pattern of racketeering activity, 'a plaintiff must plead at
least two predicate acts, show that the acts are related and that they
amount to, or pose a threat of, continuing criminal activity.' H.J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106
L.Ed.2d 195 (1989). RICO is aimed at 'racketeering activity,' which the
statute defines, in relevant part, as certain acts indictable under Federal
law, including mail and wire fraud, and violations of the Hobbs Act. 18 U.S.C.
§ 1961(1)(B). A 'pattern' requires at least two acts of 'racketeering activity,'
occurring within ten years of each other. See 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5).
Summary
Requirements for establishing a "pattern of racketeering activity" under
RICO, which includes at least two predicate acts that are related and pose a
threat of continued criminal activity. The passage specifically mentions mail
and wire fraud as examples of predicate acts under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B),
which aligns with the proposition's mention of these acts. The requirement
that these acts occur within a 10-year period and be related to pose a threat
of continued activity supports the proposition's assertion of a pattern of
racketeering activity.
Beth Israel Medical Center v. Smith, 576 F.Supp. 1061 (S.D. N.Y. 1983)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of New York
Extract
Movants' contention that separate acts of mail and wire fraud arising out of
a common nucleus of facts cannot be considered separate predicate RICO
acts is without merit. This contention has been specifically rejected by the
Courts of Appeals of at least two Circuits, for reasons which are clear. First,
the plain language of the statute refers to 'any act which is indictable' under
the mail or wire fraud statutes, without a qualification that each act must
occur in a different factual situation. Second, it would contradict the
requirement of a 'pattern of racketeering activity' to hold that the acts
making up the pattern must take place in unconnected factual
circumstances. It follows that the instant complaint, by alleging violations of
both the mail and wire fraud statutes, adequately alleges the two predicate
RICO acts required to establish a pattern of racketeering activity.

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
Separate acts of mail and wire fraud, even if arising from a common set of
facts, can be considered separate predicate acts under RICO. This supports
the proposition that multiple predicate acts, such as wire fraud and mail
fraud, can establish a pattern of racketeering activity. The court's rejection
of the argument that these acts must occur in different factual situations
aligns with the proposition's assertion that the identified acts constitute a
pattern of racketeering activity.
Uselmann v. Pop, 495 F.Supp.3d 528 (E.D. Mich. 2020)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Michigan
Extract
As previously stated, a plaintiff must allege that a RICO enterprise engaged
in a pattern of racketeering activity, which must consist of 'at least two
predicate acts of racketeering activity occurring within a ten-year period.'
Moon, 465 F.3d at 723 (citing 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5) ). RICO defines
'racketeering activity' to include a multitude of offenses that are either
'chargeable' under certain state criminal laws or 'indictable' under specified
federal criminal laws. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). Both the mail fraud statute, 18
U.S.C. § 1341, and the wire fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1343, are listed as
predicate racketeering offenses under RICO. Id.; see Moon, 465 F.3d at 723.
Summary
The court outlines the requirements for a RICO claim, emphasizing the need
for at least two predicate acts of racketeering activity within a ten-year
period. The passage specifically mentions mail fraud and wire fraud as
predicate offenses under RICO, which aligns with the proposition's mention
of these acts. The passage supports the proposition by confirming that these
acts can constitute a pattern of racketeering activity as defined by RICO.
Heden v. Hill, 937 F.Supp. 1230 (S.D. Tex. 1996)
U.S. District Court — Southern District of Texas
Extract
Under § 1961(1)(B), racketeering activity includes any act which is
indictable under a number of federal criminal statutes, including mail fraud
and wire fraud. Any act that does not fall within the purview of RICO's
definition of predicate offenses is not an act of 'racketeering activity.' ... For
mail fraud, it is necessary to show that (1) the defendants formed a scheme
or artifice to defraud; (2) the defendants used the United States mails or
caused a use of the United States mails in furtherance of the scheme; and

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
(3) the defendants did so with the specific intent to deceive or defraud. ... A
'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering
activity within a ten-year period. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). Although at least two
acts of racketeering are necessary to constitute a pattern, two acts may not
be sufficient. ... The predicate acts must 'amount to or threaten continuing
racketeering activity.'
Summary
The passage outlines the requirements for establishing a pattern of
racketeering activity under RICO, including the necessity of at least two
predicate acts within a ten-year period. It also specifies that these acts must
be indictable under federal statutes, such as mail and wire fraud, and must
threaten continued criminal activity. This directly supports the proposition
by confirming that the alleged acts of mail and wire fraud, if proven, could
constitute a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO.
Banks v. Wolk, 918 F.2d 418 (3rd Cir. 1990)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Third Circuit
Extract
The RICO claim was based on allegations that all defendants committed two
or more unspecified acts of mail and wire fraud in carrying out the scheme.
The district court dismissed the RICO count for failure to allege a 'pattern of
racketeering activity,' since the alleged fraudulent scheme 'was a one-time
happening without the threat of repetition.' See H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern
Bell Telephone Co., --- U.S. ----, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 2901-02, 106 L.Ed.2d 195
(1989) (RICO pattern requires that predicate acts pose threat of continuing
criminal activity). ... In H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., --- U.S.
----, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989), the Supreme Court addressed
the standards governing RICO's pattern requirement. The Court stressed
that a pattern requires more than the commission of two or more predicate
acts. A plaintiff must show also 'that the racketeering acts are related, and
that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.' Id. at ----,
109 S.Ct. at 2900 (emphasis in original).
Summary
Requirement under RICO that a pattern of racketeering activity must involve
predicate acts that are related and pose a threat of continued criminal
activity. The passage references the Supreme Court's decision in H.J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., which clarified that a pattern requires
more than just two predicate acts; it requires a threat of ongoing criminal
conduct. This supports the proposition that the alleged predicate acts in the
complaint, if they involve ongoing or future threats of criminal activity, could
constitute a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO.

U.S. v. Pizzonia, 577 F.3d 455 (2nd Cir. 2009)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Second Circuit
Extract
RICO, specifically 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), makes it a substantive crime 'for any
person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the
activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or
participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs
through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.' ...
This totality-of-the-circumstances approach to identifying a pattern of
racketeering is in accord with the rationale underlying RICO's pattern
requirement. 'Congress was concerned in RICO with long-term criminal
conduct.' H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. at 242, 109 S.Ct. 2893.
RICO's pattern element thus serves to ensure that a defendant's criminal
participation in an enterprise is not merely isolated or sporadic, but
indicative of the sort of continuity of criminal activity —or the threat of
continuity—that is the hallmark of racketeering.
Summary
The RICO statute requires a pattern of racketeering activity, which involves
at least two predicate acts that are related and pose a threat of continued
criminal activity. The passage emphasizes the importance of continuity and
the threat of continuity in establishing a pattern, which aligns with the
proposition that the alleged predicate acts in the complaint constitute a
pattern of racketeering activity.
Goren v. New Vision Intern., Inc., 156 F.3d 721 (7th Cir. 1998)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Seventh Circuit
Extract
A pattern of racketeering activity consists, at a minimum, of two predicate
acts of racketeering committed within a ten-year time period. The predicate
acts are violations of a specified list of criminal laws; in this case, Ms. Goren
alleges predicate acts of mail and wire fraud. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 & 1343.
As we noted earlier, a plaintiff alleging predicate acts of mail and wire fraud
must do so with particularity. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b).
Summary
The passage from "Goren v. New Vision Intern., Inc." provides a clear
explanation of what constitutes a "pattern of racketeering activity" under
RICO. It specifies that at least two predicate acts of racketeering must be
committed within a ten-year period, and these acts must be violations of
specified criminal laws, such as mail and wire fraud. This directly supports

the proposition that the complaint's identification of multiple predicate acts,
including wire fraud and mail fraud, can constitute a pattern of racketeering
activity under RICO. The passage also emphasizes the need for particularity
in pleading these acts, aligning with the requirements of Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 9(b).

U.S. Court of Appeals — Eighth Circuit
Extract
To prevail under RICO, UHC was also required to demonstrate, at a
minimum, two predicate offenses listed in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B); Atlas Pile,
886 F.2d at 990. In this case, UHC alleged predicate offenses of mail fraud
and wire fraud. Mail and wire fraud are established through proof of: '(1) a
scheme to defraud; (2) intent to defraud; (3) reasonable foreseeability that
the mails (or wires) would be used; and (4) use of the mails (or wires) in
furtherance of the scheme.' ... Although UHC clearly presented sufficient
evidence to sustain the jury's finding of predicate offenses, RICO's language
specifically requires that a plaintiff establish a 'pattern' of racketeering
activity. This language 'implies 'that while two acts are necessary, they may
not be sufficient' ' to constitute a pattern of racketeering activity. H.J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Tel., 492 U.S. 229, 237, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 2899-2900, 106
L.Ed.2d 195 (1989) (quoting Sedima, 473 U.S. at 496 n. 14, 105 S.Ct. at
3285 n. 14). Instead, to prove a pattern of racketeering activity, a plaintiff
must show that 'the racketeering predicates are related, and that they
amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.'
Summary
Requirements for establishing predicate offenses under RICO, specifically
mail and wire fraud, and emphasizes the necessity of demonstrating a
"pattern" of racketeering activity. This pattern requires that the predicate
acts are related and pose a threat of continued criminal activity, aligning
with the proposition's assertion that multiple predicate acts over a period of
months can constitute such a pattern.

2d 24 (1989).
Summary
The court confirmed the necessity for the predicate acts to be interrelated
and to pose a threat of continued criminal activity to satisfy the RICO
"pattern" requirement. This aligns with the proposition that the alleged acts
in the complaint, such as wire fraud, mail fraud, and obstruction of justice,
must be related and pose a threat of ongoing criminal conduct to constitute
a pattern of racketeering activity.
Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893,
106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
RICO's legislative history, however, establishes that Congress intended that
to prove a 'pattern of racketeering activity' a plaintiff or prosecutor must
show both 'relationship' and 'continuity'—that the racketeering predicates
are related, and that they either constitute or threaten long-term criminal
activity. Pp. 237-239... 'Racketeering activity' is defined in RICO to mean
'any act or threat involving' specified state-law crimes, any 'act' indictable
under various specified federal statutes, and certain federal 'offenses,' 18
U.S.C. § 1961(1) (1982 ed., Supp. V); but of the term 'pattern' the statute
says only that it 'requires at least two acts of racketeering activity' within a
10-year period, 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5).
Summary
The U.S. Supreme Court has clarified that to establish a "pattern of
racketeering activity" under RICO, there must be both a relationship and
continuity among the predicate acts. The acts must be related and either
constitute or threaten long-term criminal activity. The passage also confirms
that the statute requires at least two acts of racketeering within a 10-year
period. This directly supports the proposition that the alleged predicate acts,
such as wire fraud, mail fraud, and obstruction of justice, can constitute a
pattern of racketeering activity if they meet these criteria.

Extract
According to the RICO statute, a 'pattern of racketeering activity' requires
at least two acts of racketeering activity within a ten-year period. 18 U.S.C. §
1961(5). 'These predicate acts of racketeering may include, inter alia,
federal mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1341 or federal wire fraud under 18
U.S.C. § 1343.' Lum, 361 F.3d at 223; see 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) (defining
'racketeering activity').
Summary
The passage explicitly states the requirement of at least two acts of
racketeering activity within a ten-year period to establish a pattern of
racketeering activity under RICO. It also identifies mail fraud and wire fraud
as examples of predicate acts that can constitute racketeering activity. This
directly supports the proposition that the complaint's identification of
multiple predicate acts, including wire fraud and mail fraud, can establish a
pattern of racketeering activity as defined by RICO.

Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1961 provides definitions for "racketeering
activity" and "pattern of racketeering activity." It explicitly includes mail
fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice as predicate acts of
racketeering. It also specifies that a pattern of racketeering activity requires
at least two such acts within a 10-year period. This directly supports the
proposition that the identified acts in the complaint can constitute a pattern
of racketeering activity under RICO.

commercial interstate carrier... shall be fined under this title or imprisoned
not more than 20 years, or both.
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1341 defines mail fraud as a federal crime involving schemes to
defraud using the postal service or interstate carriers. This statute is
relevant to the proposition because it identifies mail fraud as a predicate act
under RICO. The passage supports the proposition by establishing that using
mail or interstate carriers to execute a fraudulent scheme is a criminal act,
which can be considered a predicate act of racketeering under RICO.
18 U.S.C. § 1343 18 U.S.C. § 1343 Fraud By Wire, Radio, Or Television
Extract
Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to
defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent
pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be
transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in
interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or
sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined
under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.
Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1343 outlines the federal crime of wire fraud,
which involves transmitting communications in interstate or foreign
commerce as part of a scheme to defraud. This directly supports the
proposition by identifying wire fraud as a predicate act under RICO, which
requires at least two predicate acts of racketeering activity. The passage
confirms that wire fraud, when committed as part of a scheme involving
interstate communications, can be considered a predicate act under RICO.

It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of racketeering activity
or through collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or maintain, directly or
indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or
the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1962 outlines unlawful activities related to racketeering,
including acquiring or maintaining control of an enterprise through a
pattern of racketeering activity. This supports the proposition by
establishing that engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity, which
includes predicate acts like wire fraud, mail fraud, and obstruction of
justice, is prohibited when it affects interstate commerce. The passage
directly relates to the definition and prohibition of such activities under
RICO, thereby supporting the claim that the identified predicate acts
constitute a pattern of racketeering activity.

Whoever uses physical force or the threat of physical force against any
person, or attempts to do so, with intent to-(A) influence, delay, or prevent
the testimony of any person in an official proceeding; (B) cause or induce
any person to-(i) withhold testimony, or withhold a record, document, or
other object, from an official proceeding; (ii) alter, destroy, mutilate, or
conceal an object with intent to impair the integrity or availability of the
object for use in an official proceeding; (iii) evade legal process summoning
that person to appear as a witness, or to produce a record, document, or
other object, in an official proceeding; or (iv) be absent from an official
proceeding to which that person has been summoned by legal process; or
(C) hinder, delay, or prevent the communication to a law enforcement officer
or judge of the United States of information relating to the commission or
possible commission of a Federal offense or a violation of conditions of
probation, supervised release, parole, or release pending judicial
proceedings; shall be punished as provided in paragraph.
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1512 outlines specific actions that constitute obstruction of
justice, such as using threats or intimidation to influence or prevent
testimony in official proceedings. These actions align with the predicate acts
described in the proposition, such as obstructing justice through threats and
intimidation. The statute provides a legal basis for considering such actions
as part of a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO, as they are related
acts that pose a threat of continued criminal activity.

Summary
Requirements for a RICO offense, specifically the need for two or more
predicate acts of racketeering activity. It emphasizes that these acts must be
related and pose a threat of continued criminal activity, which aligns with
the proposition's assertion that the alleged acts constitute a pattern of
racketeering activity. The passage also references relevant case law that
supports the interpretation of these requirements.

Extract
The most commonly charged RICO predicate acts are mail fraud and wire
fraud, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343. The elements of proof necessary to establish
mail or wire fraud predicates are set forth in Section 5.10, infra... A pattern
of racketeering activity requires at least two acts of racketeering activity
within ten years of each other... Those acts must be related to each other,
and must also amount to, or pose a threat of, continuing criminal activity.
Summary
The RICO statute requires at least two predicate acts of racketeering within
a 10-year period, which must be related and pose a threat of continued
criminal activity. The passage specifically mentions mail fraud and wire

RICO - the rejection of an economic motive requirement.
Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology - Northwestern University,
School of Law - Randolph, Jennifer G. - 1995-03-22
Extract
The Court rejected a narrow reading of the phrase 'pattern of racketeering
activity,' holding that it does not require proof of 'multiple illegal schemes'
or that the predicate acts be 'indicative of an organized crime perpetrator.'
Instead, the Court settled on a broad meaning for 'pattern of racketeering'
that requires a 'plaintiff or prosecutor [merely to] prove [a] continuity of
racketeering activity, or its threat, simpliciter.'
Summary
The Supreme Court has interpreted the "pattern of racketeering activity"
under RICO broadly. It does not require multiple illegal schemes or that the
acts be indicative of organized crime. Instead, it requires continuity of
racketeering activity or its threat. This supports the proposition that the
alleged predicate acts, such as wire fraud, mail fraud, and obstruction of
justice, can constitute a pattern of racketeering activity if they demonstrate
continuity or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.

Summary
The RICO statute requires at least two predicate acts of racketeering
activity, which can include crimes such as wire fraud, mail fraud, and
obstruction of justice. These acts must occur within a 10-year period and be
related in a way that poses a threat of continued criminal activity. The
passage directly supports the proposition by confirming that the alleged acts
in the complaint fit the statutory definition of a pattern of racketeering
activity.
Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of Action
Civil RICO: A Definitive Guide. Fifth Edition - American Bar
Association - Gregory P. Joseph
Extract
Mail and wire fraud are the two most frequently alleged predicate acts. The
mail fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1341, prohibits any person from knowingly
causing the use of the mails—or, since 1994, private carrier services like
FedEx—'for the purpose of executing' any 'scheme or artifice to defraud.'
The actual violation is the mailing, which must relate to the underlying
fraudulent scheme... 'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two
acts of racketeering activity, . . . the last of which occurred within ten years
(excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act...
The continuity requirement, according to Sedima, consists of a 'threat of
continuing activity.'
Summary
Mail and wire fraud are common predicate acts under RICO. The passage
explains that these acts must be part of a scheme to defraud and that a
pattern of racketeering activity requires at least two acts within a ten-year
period. The continuity requirement involves a threat of ongoing criminal
activity, which aligns with the proposition's mention of acts occurring over
months and involving interstate communications.

pattern of racketeering activity; (ii) directly or indirectly invested in,
maintained an interest in, or participated in, an enterprise; (iii) the activities
of which affected interstate or foreign commerce. ... While the statutory
definition of 'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of

predicate acts are continuous and interrelated.
Summary
To establish a RICO violation, the government must demonstrate a pattern of
racketeering activity, which involves at least two predicate acts that are
continuous and interrelated. The passage also highlights the necessity for
these acts to affect interstate or foreign commerce, aligning with the

Extract
A RICO offense requires two or more predicate acts of 'racketeering
activity.' (31) RICO defendants need not be convicted of each underlying
offense before a RICO offense is charged. (32) In fact, offenses of which the
defendant has been acquitted nonetheless may serve as the basis of a RICO
offense. (33)... RICO applies only where the commission of two predicate
acts constitutes a 'pattern of racketeering activity.' (47) While the statutory
definition of 'pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of
racketeering that occur within ten years of each other, (48) proof of such
acts, without more, may not suffice to establish a RICO violation. (49) There
must also be proof that the predicate acts are continuous and interrelated.
(50) Thus, 'two isolated acts of racketeering do not constitute a
pattern.' (51)... In H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., (52) the
Court held that the government must establish both a relationship between
the predicate acts and continuity of those acts to prove a 'pattern of
racketeering activity' for RICO purposes. (53)
Summary
Requirements for a RICO offense, emphasizing the need for at least two
predicate acts of racketeering within a ten-year period. It also highlights
that these acts must be continuous and interrelated, not isolated, to
establish a pattern of racketeering activity. The passage references the H.J.
Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. case, which further clarifies the
need for a relationship and continuity between the acts. This directly
supports the proposition by confirming that the alleged acts of wire fraud,
mail fraud, and obstruction of justice, if related and continuous, can
constitute a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO.

The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity...
To establish a § 1962(c) RICO claim, the following elements must be proven:
• Enterprise: A structured group of individuals associated for a common
purpose. • Pattern of racketeering activity: At least two acts of racketeering,
as specified within the statute, within 10 years.
Summary
To establish a RICO claim under § 1962(c), a plaintiff must demonstrate
conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, which
includes at least two predicate acts within a 10-year period. The passage
specifically mentions mail and wire fraud as predicate acts, which aligns
with the proposition that these acts, along with obstruction of justice, can
constitute a pattern of racketeering activity. The requirement for these acts
to be related and pose a threat of continued criminal activity is implicit in
the definition of a "pattern."
RECONCEIVING COERCION-BASED CRIMINAL DEFENSES.
Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology - Northwestern University,
School of Law - Galoob, Stephen R. - 2022-03-22
Extract
The inquiry here is meant to invoke the 'pattern of racketeering activity'
element of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
The Organized Crime Control Act (1970), which includes RICO, provides that
'criminal conduct forms a pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events.' The Supreme Court characterized this
requirement as a 'relationship' element and held that the statute further
requires a 'continuity' element, 'referring either to a closed period of
repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition.'

=== PAGE 31 ===

Summary
The passage provides a detailed explanation of the "pattern of racketeering
activity" requirement under RICO. It highlights the need for criminal acts to
be related by purpose, method, or other characteristics and emphasizes the
necessity of continuity, either through repeated conduct or conduct that
poses a future threat. This directly supports the proposition by explaining
how the alleged predicate acts could form a pattern under RICO.

Summary
The passage lists various offenses, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and
obstruction of justice, as predicate acts under the RICO statute. This directly
supports the proposition that these acts can constitute a pattern of
racketeering activity. The context of the passage is an amendment to the
RICO statute, which is a key tool in combating organized crime, and the
scope is broad as it applies to federal law enforcement efforts.

Summary
The passage clearly outlines the requirement under RICO for establishing a
"pattern of racketeering activity," which includes committing at least two
predicate offenses within a 10-year period. This directly supports the
proposition by confirming that the alleged acts of wire fraud, mail fraud, and
obstruction of justice, if proven, could constitute such a pattern. The context
of the passage, discussing the RICO statute, provides a legal basis for the
proposition, and the scope indicates that this is a general requirement under
RICO, applicable to any relevant case.

Summary
The RICO statute requires at least two predicate offenses within a 10-year
period to establish a "pattern of racketeering activity." This directly supports
the proposition that the complaint's identification of multiple predicate acts,
such as wire fraud and mail fraud, can constitute a pattern of racketeering
activity under RICO.
RICO: A Primer
Extract
The heart of a RICO case is the existence of a pattern of racketeering
activity. Under the statute, 'racketeering activity' includes a host of offenses.
Section 1961 defines the phrase to include any crime listed in subdivisions
A, B, C, D, E, F, or G of section 1961. Among other things, 'racketeering
activities' include 'any act which is indictable under' a list of federal criminal
statutes. The list covers an expansive range of violations, for example,
violations of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. ' 1951 (extortion); 18 U.S.C. ' 1341
(mail fraud) and 1343 (wire fraud)... Mail and wire fraud are the most
common predicate acts... A 'pattern' may exist where any combination of
two or more offenses occurred within a period of time. In Sedima, S.P.R.L. v.

Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, the Supreme Court held that the RICO pattern
element requires more than merely proving two predicate acts of
racketeering. Rather, proof of 'continuity plus relationship' is necessary... A
plaintiff may demonstrate a pattern by establishment that the predicate acts
pose a threat of continued criminal activity, which is generally demonstrated
by showing either: * Closed-ended continuity. Proving 'a series of related
predicate acts extending over a substantial period of time.' * Open-ended
continuity. A threat of 'continuing criminal activity extending indefinitely
into the future,' in light of the nature of the enterprise and predicate acts
alleged.
Summary
The passage explains that a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO
requires at least two predicate acts that are related and pose a threat of
continued criminal activity. It specifically mentions mail and wire fraud as
common predicate acts, which are relevant to the proposition. The passage
also discusses the concept of "continuity plus relationship," which aligns
with the requirement that the predicate acts must be related and pose a
threat of continued criminal activity. This supports the proposition that the
alleged acts in the complaint could constitute a pattern of racketeering
activity.

Summary
The passage explains that a RICO case requires a pattern of racketeering
activity, which includes offenses like mail and wire fraud. It also clarifies
that a pattern involves more than just two acts; it requires continuity and
relationship among the acts. The passage further explains how continuity
can be demonstrated through closed-ended or open-ended continuity, which
aligns with the proposition's mention of acts occurring over months and
posing a threat of continued criminal activity.
US Supreme Court Permits Foreign Plaintiff To Bring RICO Suit For US Acts
To Frustrate Enforcement Of An International Arbitral Award
Extract
In 2020, Smagin brought a civil RICO suit against Smagin and CMB Monaco,
alleging that the defendants worked at Yegiazaryan's direction to frustrate
Smagin's collection of the District Court's judgment through a pattern of
wire fraud and other RICO predicate acts, such as witness tampering and
obstruction of justice... The Court then found that Smagin's allegations
sufficiently stated a domestic injury for his RICO suit. In finding that 'the
circumstances surrounding Smagin's injury make clear it arose in the United
States,' the Court noted that much of the racketeering activity that caused
Smagin's injury, which Smagin described as his inability to collect his
judgment, took place in California.
Summary
The U.S. Supreme Court recognized a pattern of racketeering activity
involving wire fraud and obstruction of justice as sufficient to support a
RICO claim. The Court's analysis focused on the context-specific inquiry into
the nature of the injury and the racketeering activities, which aligns with the
proposition's requirement of identifying predicate acts and establishing a
pattern of racketeering activity under RICO.
Defending Civil RICO Claims: A Defense Plan Should Be In Every Business's
Arsenal
Extract
Second, to prove most types of RICO claims, the plaintiff must plead that the
defendant committed some qualifying criminal action, the most common of
which is mail, wire or securities fraud... Third, the plaintiff must plead a
pattern of racketeering activity for most RICO claims. If the alleged conduct
occurred once or twice, or was not continuous, it cannot form a pattern of
conduct sufficient to support a RICO claim.

=== PAGE 35 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
For a RICO claim to be valid, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the
defendant engaged in qualifying criminal actions, such as mail or wire fraud,
and that these actions form a pattern of racketeering activity. The passage
emphasizes the necessity of proving a pattern, which aligns with the
proposition's assertion that multiple predicate acts over a period of time can
constitute such a pattern under RICO.
