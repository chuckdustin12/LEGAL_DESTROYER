Plaintiff incorporates by reference public records from the Texas Supreme
Court, and requests the court to take judicial notice of these documents. The
Fifth Circuit has repeatedly held that it is proper for federal courts to take
judicial notice of matters of public record, including documents filed in state
court proceedings (Miller v. Dunn, 35 F.4th 1007 (5th Cir. 2022); LUV N'
Care, Ltd. v. Jackel Int'l Ltd., 502 F.Supp.3d 1106 (W.D. La. 2020); Wright v.
Arlington Indep. Sch. Dist., Civil Action No. 4:19-cv-00278-P (N.D. Tex. Nov
25, 2019)). Plaintiff therefore requests that this Court take judicial
knowledge of the consolidated mandamus record, as its’ authenticity is not
reasonably disputed. Here, all record references point to the public
consolidated mandamus record, as submitted to the Texas Supreme Court, a
copy of which has been served upon each defendant named in this complaint
either individually or through their agent. Link to the record: https://

bc41-bbc08c814365 All references to the record are marked herein with
“REC. [page]” and are hyperlinked to take the reader directly to the
reference. The record is filed under affidavit, and remains unopposed at the
time of filing this complaint. Therefore, Plaintiff respectfully asks that the
Court take judicial notice of the record under Federal Rule of Evidence 201,
filed on June 6, 2025, in the Texas Supreme Court under case numbers
25-0361, 25-0367, 25-0378, 25-0426, and 25-0458. II. TIMELINE OF
EVENTS BACKGROUND Morgan Michelle Myers, (“Myers”) and Charles
Dustin Myers, (“Plaintiff”) were married on June 20, 2015, and have two
daughters, C.R.M. and M.E.M, aged seven and nine. The evidence in this
case will show that in early December of 2023, the entire family was
blindsided by Myers’ sudden announcement that she wanted a divorce from
Plaintiff. REC. 717 The evidence will further show that Myers’ reasoning for
this divorce changes over time – beginning with how Plaintiff spoke to her,
and then switches to abuse and sexual harassment, and allegations of drug
abuse, claims that were only brought up in her initial pleadings. On
December 12, 2023, Plaintiff discovered a large volume of text messages
between Myers and two individuals identified as Debbie Price and Damen
Kazlauskas of Fort Worth, Texas spanning between October 2022 and
December 2023. REC. 254-714 In response to this discovery, Myers began to
communicate with Defendant Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, a resident of
Yukon, Oklahoma, who assisted her in the planning, drafting, traveling, and
submitting of fraudulent documents to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant
County designed to divest Plaintiff of his home and business operations.
When these allegations were raised to the State, they failed to adjudicate
them and violated the Plaintiff’s constitutional rights when he was deprived
of the guarantees of equal protection under the law and when he was not
afforded due process before being deprived of his property. REC. 183. The
central question is whether Defendants Munford, Kaitcer, Carter, and Baker
are victims of the initial scheme – or willing participants in an expanded
associate-in-fact enterprise that began in December of 2023 as the Myers-
Branthoover enterprise. A. The Myers-Branthoover Enterprise 1. On
December 14, 2023, Defendants Morgan Michelle Myers (“Myers)” and
Daniel Kenneth Branthoover (“Branthoover”), acting in concert and under
deceptive pretenses, (REC. 1704), initiated text-message communications
through which they formed and advanced a common plan and agreement.
Over the weekend of December 15, 2023, they met in Yukon, Oklahoma, to
further that plan ( REC. 274-278). The deceptive text message from
Defendant Branthoover claiming that he wanted to assist Plaintiff was
following an attempt by Myers to receive an ex-parte order of protection
from the 322nd District Court of Tarrant county, attempted on December 14,
2023 (REC. 78). B. Interstate Travel and Transfer 2. As part of their
agreement, both Defendants planned to draft and submit an original petition
for divorce and an affidavit of indigency to the 322nd District Court of
Tarrant County, with the intended and foreseeable result of removing
Plaintiff from his matrimonial residence at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas
76148—which also serves as his place of business for clients in the United
States, Canada, and the United Kingdom that rely on his market data
services (REC. 812 ¶ 16). 3. During Defendant Myers’s interstate travel, she
transferred the parties’ marital funds into Defendant Branthoover’s PayPal
account in the amount of $1,576 (REC. 723). Those proceeds funded a
second mobile phone (817-940-0852), listed on the fraudulent pleadings that

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Myers and Branthoover jointly prepared in Oklahoma, which Myers then
carried from Yukon to Texas on December 17, 2023 (REC. 86; 99; 102; 107).
C. Admissions 4. On December 16, 2023, Plaintiff reached out to
Branthoover and requested that the $1,576 be returned as they were needed
for Christmas gifts for the children, and for business advertising expenses
for his business. REC. 728-729. In response, defendant Branthoover
admitted that the purpose of defendant Myers’ visit was to help her prepare
paperwork for divorce litigation and confirmed that the transfer of $1,576
did in fact occur. REC. 730. Plaintiff’s bank statement from December 2023
further confirms this transaction. REC. 723. D. Post-submission
Collaboration 5. On December 18, 2023, defendant Myers submitted the
fraudulently prepared original petition for divorce, and an affidavit of
indigency to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County. After these
documents were submitted, defendant Branthoover sent a text message to
Plaintiff on December 19, 2023, at 5:50 P.M. CST, holding himself out to be
defendant Myers’ attorney, showing his involvement extends past the initial
help in preparing the fraudulent documents. REC. 1712-1713 6. Four days
later, on December 22, 2023, defendant Myers submitted another knowingly
fraudulent application for protective to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant
County claiming that family violence had occurred on December 18, 2023,
supported by both an affidavit and unsworn declaration. REC. 108-109. E.
Significant and Intentional Misrepresentations 7. On December 27 and
December 28, 2023, respectively, the documents prepared by Myers with
the assistance of Branthoover were served on Plaintiff via the U.S.
Constable, and contained the following misrepresentations: i. That
defendant Myers could not afford court costs; REC. 72, REC. 85-96 ii. That
defendant Myers had an active order of protection against the Plaintiff with
a finding of family violence that had occurred during the marriage; REC. 78
at 10 iii. That defendant Myers was financially responsible for the family
vehicles, rent payments, utilities, and other household expenses, making
herself appear as the primary breadwinner; REC. 92 iv. That defendant
Myers would be harassed or abused if Plaintiff were given her newly
acquired phone number that was obtained while in Oklahoma; REC. 81 at
15. v. That defendant Myers and Plaintiff ceased living together on
December 1, 2023; REC. 74 at 4 vi. That family violence occurred on
December 18, 2023, in the presence of the two Children. REC. 108-109. vii.
That both family vehicles were defendant Myers’ separate property acquired
before marriage. REC. 79 at 11B F. Evidence to the Contrary 8. On the same
day Defendant Myers claimed to be in an emergency requiring the Plaintiff’s
prompt removal from the home, she can be seen at the home with Plaintiff
and the children in no state of emergency and also still cohabitating in the
marital home. REC 1715. 9. Again, on December 29, 2023, Defendant Myers
can be seen with Plaintiff at the family home, smiling and laughing with the
children in no state of emergency and still collaborating with Plaintiff in the
marital home. REC. 1735. 10. The citation for the application for protective
order ordered Respondent to show cause as to why it should not issue with a
hearing scheduled for January 16, 2024. REC. 118. 11. In response to
extensive misrepresentation above, Plaintiff prepared an original answer,
filed a motion to consolidate, and provided background information which
alleged that defendant Myers was intentionally abusing the legal process.
REC. 130-132. Plaintiff was ordered to show cause on January 16, 2024,
regarding the protective order application. REC. 118 G. Inclement Weather

and First Appearance 12. On January 15, 2024, the Tarrant County District
Courts Facebook page sent out a notice informing the members of the public
that the court would be closed on January 16, 2024, due to inclement
weather. REC. 1202. 13. Unaware of the closure at the time, the parties
appeared at the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County on January 16, 2024,
and were met with a dark courtroom, with only one judge in the building at
the time of their arrival – Defendant James Munford (“Munford”). 14.
Defendant Munford summarily ordered the Plaintiff out of his home,
inadvertently assisting the Myers-Branthoover associate-in-fact enterprise of
achieving their primary goal in having the Plaintiff removed from his
residence, despite the broader goal being to obtain a decree of divorce to
permanently divest Plaintiff of his interests. REC. 183. 15. Defendant
Munford’s initial order was baseless, made in the absence of any emergency,
without a hearing, and disregarded the Plaintiff’s pleadings, telling Myers
“you’re going to have to find evidence of family violence!” clearly aware that
this order was made without any regard to the Plaintiff’s constitutional
rights. 16. Defendant Jeffrey Kaitcer, (“Kaitcer”) walked into the courtroom
late due to the inclement weather and turned the courtroom into a laughing
matter as he began to joke with Defendant Munford, and instructed the
parties to download the AppClose app for communication, and the matter
was reset for January 22, 2024. There exists no record of this proceeding,
only marked appearances on the docket. H. Reset #1 – January 22, 2024,
Setting 17. At the January 22 reset hearing, the parties appeared only to
have the case reset once more because defendant Myers allegedly retained
the services of Defendant Cooper Carter, (“Carter”) in the lobby of the
courthouse just moments before the hearing was scheduled to begin. No
appearance can be traced to this setting by either party on the docket (REC.
1551), and once again, no hearing was held, and the case reset for a second
time to February 1, 2024. REC. 186. 18. Kaitcer permitted attorney Dan
Bacalis, Plaintiff’s prior attorney, to fill out the Associate Judge’s Report, and
the parties never went before him as indicated by the case docket’s lack of
appearance on this date by either party. I. Reset #2 – February 1, 2024,
Setting 19. One day prior to the February 1 setting, both attorneys,
Defendant Carter and Dan Bacalis, both amended the petition for divorce
and counterpetition for divorce without the parties’ knowledge. (REC. 189,
REC. 209) These amended documents were similar, submitted on the same
day, and raised concerns for Plaintiff regarding his quality of representation.
20. At the February 1 setting, both parties were in the conference rooms
outside of Defendant Kaitcer’s courtroom, when attorney Bacalis walks in
holding a settlement agreement. When Plaintiff refused this option and
requested that they go have a hearing before the judge. 21. This is when
Bacalis stated, as witness affidavits corroborate, that he “knows this Judge
and this is the best we can get.” and further stated “[w]e’ll be here all day.
We can come back and change it later.” 22. Outraged by this response,
Plaintiff paid very close attention to the settlement offer Bacalis was
pressuring him to sign, and noticed the following provisions: A typed written
Order conforming to this Report will follow within 20 days from the date this
Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be prepared by DAN BACALIS.
Each attorney should approve the Order. The parties do not need to approve
the Order. The attorney reviewing the proposed Order shall have five (5)
days to do so. There arc no ten (JO) day letters. If an agreement is not
reached, a Motion to Sign shall be filed and set within thirty (30) days from

=== PAGE 5 ===

the signing of this Report. IT IS SO ORDERED (REC. 233) J. Termination of
Counsel and the Emergency Motion 23. With the above provisions in mind,
Plaintiff signed the document and immediately fired his attorney and
provided notice to the court. REC. 221. By doing so, Plaintiff gained access
back to the residency, invalidated the agreement, and was able to use the
time back in the house to run damage control on his business operations
while preparing to expose the Myers-Branthoover enterprise to the court via
a MOTION TO RECONSIDER EVIDENCE AND VACATE TEMPORARY
ORDERS, which was filed on February 9, 2024, within three business days of
the February 1 agreed associate judge’s report being served by the clerk.
REC. 240 24. In this motion, it was specifically stated that: i. “I am seeking
immediate court intervention to correct procedural e rrors and address the
misuse of the legal system by the Petitioner.” REC. 244 ii. “Particularly, Dan
Branthoover became involved. He is the boyfriend of the Petitioner’s Mother.
Shortly thereafter, I received a notice from our joint bank account stating
that $1,576 had just been withdrawn. As our bank statement for December
2023 will demonstrate – the transaction record shows the funds being
transferred directly to Mr. Branthoover’s PayPal account” REC. 245 iii. “The
Petitioner's action of filing for divorce under an Affidavit of Inability to pay
three days after transferring $1,576 to herself starkly contravenes the
mandates set forth in Chapter 10, Section 10.001 of the Civil Practice and
Remedies Code”. REC 247 at B2 iv. “The Petitioner violated Chapter 10,
Section 10.001 a second time within the same document when she
intentionally elected to waive the 60-day waiting period claiming to have an
active protective order against me that found family violence had occurred
during our marriage.” REC 247 at B3. v. “This suit was the second attempt
by the Petitioner to have me removed from the home, which ultimately
succeeded.” REC 248 at D1 25. The motion went on to explain the factual
pattern described up to this point, putting the court on notice of the key
issues with provided exhibits which were duly served on Carter. In response
to Plaintiff’s motion, he received the first of just two email communications
from Carter throughout the case’s history, where she claimed she would be
filing a counter motion when disclosing her availability for the hearing on
Plaintiff’s emergency motion. REC. 2794 No such countermotion was filed
by Carter. K. Summary Judgment and Notice of Hearing 26. By February 22,
no response had been filed by Carter, so Plaintiff filed a Partial Motion for
Summary Judgment. REC. 758. Plaintiff also submitted a proposed parenting
plan as Exhibit D. REC. 769. No response was ever received from Carter. 27.
On February 27, 2024, Defendant Munford signed and issued a notice of
hearing to the parties with the hearing set for March 14, 2024. REC. 776. L.
Plaintiff’s Notice to the Court and Defendant Myers’ Self-Help Remedies 28.
On March 3, 2024, Plaintiff notified the Court that he would not be leaving
the home as it was not in the best interests of his children. REC. 782. 29.
The following day, on March 6, 2024, while walking his daughters to school,
Myers ran inside the family home, and locked him out of the marital
residence, leaving a sign on the door that said “[y]ou should have been out
by Saturday you are now locked out!” REC. 1748. 30. Plaintiff called local
law enforcement to help him regain entry into the home, where mother
produced the agreed associate judge’s report signed on February 1, 2024,
and used it as a means to block Plaintiff’s entrance to the home. 31. To avoid
further conflict, Plaintiff was escorted into the home where he was able to
grab only his computer and a few clothes and went to Flower Mound to

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
temporarily stay with his father until the time of the hearing on his
emergency motion, scheduled for March 14, 2024, at 9:00 A.M. L. The
Hearing On Plaintiff’s Emergency Motion 32. On March 14, 2024, the
parties arrived at the 322nd District Court, and on the way into the
courtroom, defendants Myers and Carter could be seen in the conference
room, quickly shuffling papers back and forth. 33. After checking in with the
bailiff, Plaintiff turned around to see defendant Carter extending to him a
document titled “Temporary Orders” that were the reduced version of the
February 1 associate judge’s report. REC. 888. 34. These orders, which were
not prepared by Dan Bacalis, which were not agreed to by the parties, were
reduced well outside of the 20-day requirement as ordered by the judge, and
which were never filed with the clerk, stated the following
misrepresentations: i. On February 1, 2024, the Court heard Petitioner's
motion for temporary orders. ii. The parties have agreed to the terms of this
order as evidenced by the signatures below. REC. 888. iii. The Court, after
examining the record and the agreement of the parties and hearing the
evidence and argument of counsel, finds that all necessary prerequisites of
the law have been legally satisfied and that the Court has jurisdiction of this
case and of all the parties. REC. 888. iv. The dates that the parties would
have access to the family residence was altered, changing the date Plaintiff
was supposed to leave from March 1, 2024, to March 20, 2024, and
changing Myers’ date of re-entry from March 1, 2024, to March 30, 2024,
leaving a 10-day window where no one would occupy the residence. v. This
modification was made to prevent Myers from being liable for illegally
locking Plaintiff out of the home on March 6, 2024. 35. On the last page of
the orders, Plaintiff’s attorney who was terminated weeks earlier did not
sign the document, and Plaintiff refused to sign the document for the
forthcoming reasons: i. It claimed a hearing occurred on a motion which was
never set for a hearing or served on the Plaintiff and doesn’t exist on the
docket. ii. It was prepared by defendant Carter, not Dan Bacalis. iii. The
associate judge was presiding over a de novo request of his own prior
report. iv. The matrimonial address was incorrect, as it stated “6641 Anns
Court”, rather than 6641 Anne Court. REC. 915, REC. 922 v. The orders
were not in the best interests of the children. vi. Notwithstanding the
Plaintiff’s revocation of consent by filing the emergency motion, the terms
were altered right before they were rendered into effect by defendant
Kaitcer. vii. Plaintiff did not agree to the terms as he was in court that very
day to expose Myers. M. Predicate Acts: Extortion 36. Kaitcer, knowing that
no response was filed, knowing that he was presiding over a hearing to
which he had no subject matter jurisdiction, and knowing that the temporary
orders produced by defendant Carter was served just moments earlier,
signed another associate judge’s report pre-drafted by defendant Carter,
which summarily denied the Plaintiff’s emergency motion, ignored the fact
that Carter had not provided a response, and within the report itself,
Plaintiff was ordered to sign the document that Carter had just presented to
him despite raising objections to its’ contents, and despite his consent not
being present. REC. 795. 37. Finally, defendant Kaitcer refused to consider
Plaintiff’s exhibits, including six affidavits prepared by his business clients
who have been directly affected by his inability to provide the real-time
market data services his clients relied on, who were located throughout the
United States. REC. 851; REC. 854; REC. 857; REC. 860; REC. 863; REC.
867; REC. 870. 38. Following the setting, the orders were rendered into

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
effect without Plaintiff’s signature (REC. 925) , and Plaintiff filed a request
for findings of fact and conclusions of law (REC. 883), and filed and
amended a “Preparatory Notice for Judicial Review” which recounted the
factual timeline up to that point, and included the affidavits that Kaitcer
refused to accept on March 14, 2024. REC. 798, REC. 851, REC. 854, REC.
857, REC. 860, REC. 863, REC. 867, REC. 870. 39. The orders stated they
were to remain in effect until the final decree of divorce, and Plaintiff’s
journey of one-sided appeals began. N. One Sided Appellate Efforts, and
Defective IWO 40. Following the rendition of the temporary orders on March
26, 2024, Plaintiff spent between April 8, 2024 and September 15, 2024,
appealing via mandamus to the Second Court of Appeals and the Texas
Supreme Court. REC. 1010. 41. During the appellate efforts, Carter filed one
of two motions in the case, which was a motion for pre-trial conference filed
on April 24, 2024, on her behalf by Roderick D. Marx, a party not named in
the suit. REC. 1014, REC. 1016. 42. Plaintiff immediately objected to the
pre-trial conference, and no response was ever issued by Carter or the
court. REC. 1018. 43. On April 30th, Plaintiff filed his notice of completion
regarding the parenting course as ordered, despite actively trying to vacate
them. REC. 1047. No parenting course was ever completed by Myers. 44. On
May 2, 2024, Plaintiff’s en banc reconsideration was denied in the Second
Court of Appeals, and he began preparing an appeal to the Supreme Court
of Texas. REC. 1067. 45. On May 19, 2024, Carter sent the second and last
email correspondence that would be received in the case, which falsely
claimed he agreed to the orders signed on March 14, 2024, and requested
that he fill out an IWO, which Plaintiff found to be defective. REC. 1722,
REC. 1728. No further correspondence was received by Carter. O.
Fraudulent Intervention and Branthoover’s Continued Involvement 46. On
June 23rd Plaintiff filed a motion in state court entitled MOTION FOR
JOINDER OF PERSONS NEEDED FOR JUST ADJUDICATION at 12:14 P.M.
REC. 1075. This motion received no response from Carter. 47. On June 23rd
at 1:54 P.M., directly following the submission of the motion, Branthoover
texted Plaintiff stating “Lol. And here comes another denial. Please sue me
individually. Please.”, referring to the earlier filed motion and showing his
continued oversight of the case’s progression since his initial predicate acts.
48. Four days later, on June 28, 2024, the Texas Office of the Attorney
General allegedly filed an intervention pleading, claiming that Plaintiff was
past due on child support, and requested information from Plaintiff. REC.
1099. 49. Most notably, the certificate of service to this intervention
pleading was allegedly signed by Holly Hayes, the designated attorney for
the OAG, yet the name underneath the signature line reads CHOYA
BURKLEY. REC. 1102. 50. Plaintiff promptly objected to the intervention,
and never received any response from the OAG, Carter, or the court. REC.
1106. P. Supreme Court, Rule 12, and Emergency Temporary Orders 51. As
Plaintiff continued to appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas, all prosecution
came to an end in the trial court. It wasn’t until September 15, 2024, that
Plaintiff filed a first amended rehearing motion in the Texas Supreme Court,
(REC. 1136) and after noticing Carter’s lack of participation, he began to
question her authority given several ambiguities surrounding her
representation, and filed a rule 12 motion to show authority. REC. 1170. No
response was ever received to this motion from Carter. 52. At this point,
Plaintiff had been staying in Airbnb homes while he sought relief to ensure
he could remain close to his daughters during this time. On September 26,

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
2024, he filed and later amended an EMERGENCY MOTION FOR
TEMPORARY ORDERS and requested expedited relief by October 1, 2024,
as that was when Plaintiff was forced to move away from the area due to
cost of living being unsustainable. REC. 1184. No response was ever
received from Carter regarding this motion. 53. By October 1, Plaintiff had
no choice but to start pursuing administrative remedies, and thought the
court was biased against him given the case’s history up to that point. He
began to prepare a Joint Motion to Recuse defendants Munford and Kaitcer
and filed it with the clerk of the court on October 7, 2024. REC. 1197. Q.
Predicate Act: Wire Fraud 54. On October 8, 2024, Defendant Munford
signed and forwarded a “Joint Motion to Recuse” attached to his order of
referral to regional presiding judge David L. Evans but was notably missing
the exhibits and affidavit critical to the motion. REC. 1222 55. A copy of this
exchange was sent via defendant Baker on 4:43 P.M. on October 8. REC.
1254 56. Plaintiff immediately pointed out the discrepancies between the
motion filed and the motion forwarded to David L. Evans, where she replied
and admitted that the full document had been e-filed and remains with the
court. REC. 1255 57. Unsatisfied with this response, Plaintiff further pointed
out that the filing size of the document filed and the one referring to David
L. Evans was significantly different. No further correspondence was
received by Baker until the following day. REC. 1256 58. The following day
on October 8, 2024, defendant Munford signed and filed an “Amended Order
of Referral” which had the full motion attached this time, albeit still
modified as the hyperlinks and bookmarks had been removed. REC. 1282 59.
This amended referral was sent via email correspondence by Baker at 11:17
A.M. on October 8, 2024, who stated that due to the size of the motion, it
was split into three parts. REC. 1258. This excuse directly contradicts the
standard filing procedure in Tarrant County, which was raised and
subsequently ignored in an objection. REC. 1269. No response was filed in
regard to the motion to recuse or objection by Carter. R. Recusal Denial and
More Delays, and Federal Removal 60. Justice E. Lee Gabriel was assigned
to hear the motion, which had to be rescheduled due to technical difficulties
for November 7, 2024. REC. 1306. 61. The morning of the hearing, Plaintiff
woke up with a dental emergency, and promptly notified all parties, and
requested a reset for the hearing, which everyone agreed to. REC.
1393-1396. 62. Despite this agreement, the recusal was denied for failure to
appear, and made no mention of the agreement or the emergency. REC.
1398. 63. With no other remedies left, Plaintiff removed the case to Federal
Court on December 2, 2024, which was quickly remanded back on
December 4, 2024. REC. 1426. 64. On December 14, 2024, defendant
Branthoover texted Plaintiff, sending a threat which stated “[w]hen things
all over, you get to deal with me.” at 2:15 P.M. REC. 1720 65. On December
16, 2024, Plaintiff initiated suit against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover in the
Western District of Oklahoma seeking relief in the form of damages from the
ongoing deprivation from his home. REC. 1451. 66. Plaintiff notified the
Texas court of this lawsuit on December 31, 2024. REC. 1446. S. Further
Delays, Motion to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution, and the Original SAPCR
67. On January 24, 2025, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss for want of
prosecution due to the total lack of participation in the case by the opposing
party. REC. 1527. No response was ever received from Carter on this
motion. 68. On January 29, 2025, defendant Myers began disposing of
Plaintiff’s personal belongings that remained on the family property. REC.

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
1629-1631. 69. On February 12, 2025, Plaintiff learned that his youngest
daughter was suffering from dental pain due to Myers’ failure to obtain
dental insurance for the children. REC. 3281. 70. By March 14, (REC.
1833-1837) the judges had still not been reinstated from the first recusal,
which lad Plaintiff to reach out to Baker to request a hearing on his
unopposed summary judgment that had been on the docket since February
22, 2024, where he had to remind her to reinstate the judges back into the
case. REC. 1833-1837. 71. Given the delays, and since the case had been
brought in bad faith initially, the Plaintiff opened an original SAPCR suit in
the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County on March 18, 2025, where he
argued for dominant jurisdiction in a cover letter sent to the clerk. REC.
2260. T. Counsel Suddenly Becomes Active 72. The very next day, defendant
Carter filed an original answer filed on her behalf by Roderick Marx. REC.
2279. The motion was a boilerplate motion, and was followed by a motion to
consolidate, which was filed in the wrong court, and was also filed on
Carter’s behalf by RODERICK D. MARX. REC. 2284. 73. The Plaintiff
immediately responded by filing a motion to strike (REC. 1957) a Rule 12
motion to show authority challenging both Carter and RODERICK D MARX’s
authority (REC. 2288) and on March 24, 2025, an emergency ex-parte TRO
to prevent Myers from barring Plaintiff’s access to the home. (REC. 2302)
No responses were ever received from Carter on these motions. 74. On
March 26, 2025, an objection was filed to Carter’s consolidation motion in
the 233rd court. REC. 1881. 75. Plaintiff reached out to the coordinator from
the 233rd and went through the process to present the motion to the judge.
REC. 2338-2341. 76. On March 29, 2025, Plaintiff appeared before Associate
Judge Kate Stone, who refused to hear Plaintiff’s emergency motion despite
no response being filed, and told him to leave the courtroom. The hearing
date scheduled for April 10, 2025, as agreed by Carter and Plaintiff (REC.
2358), was actually un-set by Stone. REC. 2361. 77. The grounds for this
outright refusal was due to Carter calling in a favor from the judge without
even being present in the courtroom, to where Stone left the room, came
back, and told the Plaintiff to leave informing him that a motion to
consolidate would be filed by Carter the following week. U. Five Concurrent
Mandamus Petitions 78. Subsequently, after he was turned away from the
courtroom, Carter’s consolidation motion wasn’t filed until April 4, 2025
(REC. 2367), resulting in two mandamus petitions to try again to have the
March 14, 2024, order signed by Kaitcer vacated, and to compel Kate Stone
to hear the emergency TRO. See 25-0361, 25-0367. 79. On the same day the
mandamus was filed against Stone, District Judge Kenneth Newell sua
sponte granted Carter’s consolidation motion in both courts without a
hearing, and without addressing the emergency situation for the children or
the Plaintiff’s objections, leading to a third mandamus proceeding. REC.
2393, See also 25-0378. 80. On April 23, 2025, a notice of trial setting was
served on the parties by defendant Munford in the midst of all of these
issues. REC. 1773. 81. The same day, Plaintiff filed an objection and
requested an emergency stay. REC. 2219. No response was received to this
objection by either Munford or Carter. 82. Two days later on April 25, 2025,
Plaintiff filed his second recusal motion, and amended it on April 28, 2025,
this time only against Munford, and requested that the rules of procedure be
followed, and objected to the involvement of the court coordinator given the
prior recusal’s ambiguity and significant delays caused by her involvement.
REC. 2488 No response to this motion was ever filed from Carter. 83. Baker

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
continued to be involved in the recusal process, this time erroneously
forwarding an order of referral from defendant Kaitcer, who was not named
in the recusal motion. REC. 2615. 84. Plaintiff immediately objected on April
29, 2025, naming two issues: 1) the coordinator was still involved, and 2) the
order of referral sent by Kaitcer was erroneous. REC. 2620. 84. Plaintiff
objected to the order of assignment of John H. Cayce (REC. 3149) which was
issued on May 7, 2025, due to the unresolves issues. REC. 2620. 85. David L.
Evans overruled this objection on May 15, 2025, leading to mandamus
petition 25-0426, a direct appeal to the Texas Supreme Court. REC. 3507.
86. On May 20, 2025, John H. Cayce summarily denied the recusal, including
the denial of a motion to recuse Kaitcer which was never filed, leading to
mandamus petition 25-0458, a second direct appeal to the Texas Supreme
Court. 87. All five petitions were denied both initially and on rehearing, and
all emergency motions to stay proceedings were dismissed. The only insights
given from the appellate courts was: “Denied, per curiam.” No response was
filed by any implicated judge or opposing counsel. V. Federal RICO Case and
the Push Towards Final Trial 88. In June of 2025, Plaintiff amended his
complaint against Daniel Kenneth Branthoover and enjoined Myers as a
defendant, which they defended pro-se. 89. Plaintiff communicated this
action with the trial court, and no further action was taken in the case until
August of 2025, when defendant Munford sua sponte set the case for final
trial on December 10, 2025. 90. Plaintiff immediately objected to this trial
setting, and moved to recuse Munford for a third time. 91. The court
coordinator continued to be involved in the process, leading to a subsequent
motion to recuse the regional presiding judge, David L. Evans. 92. Plaintiff
now prepares this suit to hold defendants accountable for their collective
actions, and to prevent their common goal from being achieved, which is to
obtain defendant Myers a final decree of divorce. 93. For the forthcoming
reasons, the conduct outlined herein constitutes conduct of an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity, as several predicate acts were
committed, the enterprise shares a common purpose, and Plaintiff has
suffered direct and ongoing injury to business and property as a direct result
of the defendant’s collective predicate acts. RICO The timeline and evidence
provided demonstrate that the Myers-Branthoover group constitutes an
association-in-fact enterprise under RICO, with a common goal to deprive
the Plaintiff of his home and business through a pattern of racketeering
activity—specifically, wire fraud, Travel Act violations, and fraudulent court
filings—causing direct injury to the Plaintiff’s business and property. The
conduct, structure, and continuity among the participants, as well as the use
of interstate communications and travel, satisfy the elements of a RICO
claim in the Tenth Circuit, with the liability of other defendants depending
on their knowledge and intent. A. Summary The Myers-Branthoover
enterprise, as detailed in the factual timeline, meets the Tenth Circuit’s
requirements for a RICO claim by establishing an association-in-fact
enterprise with a defined structure, purpose, and continuity. The group’s
coordinated actions—including interstate transfer of funds, preparation and
submission of fraudulent legal documents, and ongoing manipulation of
court proceedings—constitute a pattern of racketeering activity, with
predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations that are related and
continuous. Plaintiff’s direct and ongoing injury to his business and property,
including loss of home, business operations, and client relationships, is
proximately caused by the enterprise’s acts. While Myers and Branthoover’s

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
liability is clear, the involvement of other defendants (Munford, Kaitcer,
Carter, and Baker) may be characterized as inadvertent or willing
participation, depending on their knowledge and intent, but the core
elements of a RICO violation are satisfied by the conduct of Myers and
Branthoover as outlined in the enumerated timeline. The additional acts
committed by each defendant, as alleged, furthered the scheme of the
enterprise despite each additional defendant having actual knowledge of the
fraudulent scheme. RICO Statutory Framework The Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), codified at 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968,
provides a civil cause of action for individuals injured in their business or
property by reason of a pattern of racketeering activity conducted through
an enterprise affecting interstate or foreign commerce. The most commonly
invoked provision, § 1962(c), prohibits any person employed by or associated
with an enterprise from conducting or participating in the conduct of such
enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. Section
1962(d) further prohibits conspiracies to violate any of the substantive RICO
provisions. To establish a civil RICO claim under § 1962(c), a plaintiff must
prove: i. The existence of an enterprise; ii. The enterprise’s engagement in,
or effect on, interstate or foreign commerce; iii. The defendant’s
employment by or association with the enterprise; iv. The defendant’s
participation, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs;
v. The defendant’s participation through a pattern of racketeering activity or
collection of unlawful debt. See 100 Mount Holly Bypass v. Axos Bank, Case
No. 2:20-CV-856-TS-CMR (D. Utah Jul 27, 2021). B. Predicate Acts and
Pattern Requirement RICO defines “racketeering activity” to include a wide
range of criminal offenses, including wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343) and
violations of the Travel Act (18 U.S.C. § 1952). A “pattern of racketeering
activity” requires at least two predicate acts within a ten-year period, but
the acts must be related and amount to or pose a threat of continued
criminal activity. The Supreme Court has clarified that a RICO violation
requires both an “enterprise” and a “pattern of racketeering activity,” with
the enterprise being a group of persons associated for a common purpose,
and the pattern involving a series of criminal acts (United States v. Harris,
695 F.3d 1125 (10th Cir. 2012)). The Tenth Circuit has further explained
that, to establish a pattern, it is not enough to simply show that two
predicate acts occurred within ten years; the acts must also be related and
pose a threat of continued criminal activity (U.S. v. Smith, 413 F.3d 1253
(10th Cir. 2005)). Note, however, that U.S. v. Smith has been stated as
overruled by United States v. Nissen, 555 F.Supp.3d 1174 (D. N.M. 2021) on
unrelated grounds, but its articulation of the pattern requirement remains
consistent with current law. C. Enterprise and Association-in-Fact An
“enterprise” under RICO includes any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or group of individuals associated in fact, even if not a legal
entity. For an association-in-fact enterprise, the Tenth Circuit requires: i. A
purpose; ii. Relationships among those associated with the enterprise; iii.
Longevity sufficient to permit the associates to pursue the enterprise’s
purpose; iv. A decision-making framework or mechanism for controlling the
group; v. Functioning as a continuing unit; vi. Existence separate and apart
from the pattern of racketeering activity. See 100 Mount Holly Bypass. D.
Conspiracy Section 1962(d) makes it unlawful to conspire to violate any of
the substantive RICO provisions. A RICO conspiracy does not require the
establishment of an enterprise but requires that a defendant adopts the goal

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
of furthering or facilitating a criminal endeavor that would satisfy the
elements of a substantive RICO offense (United States v. Martinez, 543
F.Supp.3d 1209 (D. N.M. 2021); United States v. Randall, 661 F.3d 1291
(10th Cir. 2011)). E. Injury Requirement RICO provides a private right of
action for individuals injured in their business or property through
fraudulent conduct, and there is no requirement that the conduct be
connected to organized crime in a civil setting (Plains Resources, Inc. v.
Gable, 782 F.2d 883 (10th Cir. 1986)). ANALYSIS F. Existence of an
Association-in-Fact Enterprise The timeline establishes that Myers and
Branthoover formed an association-in-fact enterprise beginning in December
2023 (¶¶ 1–7, 93). Their collaboration was structured, with Myers as the
petitioner in the divorce and Branthoover as the planner, drafter, and
facilitator of fraudulent documents and financial transactions. The group
had a clear purpose: to divest the Plaintiff of his home and business through
fraudulent legal filings and manipulation of court processes (¶¶ 1–7, 93).
The enterprise’s structure is evidenced by: i. The initial planning and
agreement to meet in Yukon, Oklahoma, to draft fraudulent documents (¶¶
1–3); ii. The use of interstate communications and travel to further the
scheme (¶¶ 2–3); iii. Ongoing coordination and adaptation to changing
circumstances, including the preparation and submission of false affidavits
and pleadings, and manipulation of court proceedings (¶¶ 5–7, 34, 93). This
satisfies the Tenth Circuit’s requirements for an association-in-fact
enterprise, which does not require a formal legal entity but does require a
common purpose, relationships, and sufficient longevity to pursue the
enterprise’s goals. G. Structure, Purpose, Relationships, and Continuity The
Myers-Branthoover group meets the requirements for an association-in-fact
enterprise: i. Purpose: The shared goal was to deprive the Plaintiff of his
home, business, and property interests through fraudulent means (¶¶ 1–7,
93). ii. Relationships: Myers and Branthoover maintained ongoing
communications, coordinated actions, and divided roles in the scheme (¶¶ 1–
7, 93). iii. Longevity and Continuity: The enterprise operated over a
substantial period, from at least December 2023 through present day 2025,
with multiple related acts and ongoing adaptation to changing
circumstances (¶¶ 1–93). iv. Decision-Making Framework: The group
planned, agreed on steps, and executed those steps in a coordinated manner
(¶¶ 1–7, 93). v. Existence Separate from Predicate Acts: The enterprise was
formed for the purpose of achieving a specific goal and engaged in multiple
acts over time to accomplish that goal. H. Predicate Acts: Wire Fraud, Travel
Act Violations, and Fraudulent Filings The timeline identifies multiple
predicate acts that qualify as racketeering activity under RICO: i. Wire
Fraud: Myers transferred $1,576 in marital funds to Branthoover’s PayPal
account during interstate travel, and these funds were used to purchase a
phone for use in the fraudulent scheme (¶¶ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 34). The use of
electronic communications (text messages, emails) to plan and execute the
scheme further supports the wire fraud allegation (¶¶ 1–7, 34). ii. Travel Act
Violations: Myers traveled from Texas to Oklahoma to meet with
Branthoover, where they planned and prepared fraudulent legal documents,
which were then transported back to Texas and submitted to the court (¶¶ 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7). iii. Fraudulent Filings: The preparation and submission of false
affidavits and pleadings to the court, containing material misrepresentations
about financial status, family violence, and property ownership, constitute
further predicate acts (¶¶ 5, 6, 7, 34). At least two related predicate acts

=== PAGE 13 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
within ten years are required (U.S. v. Smith, 413 F.3d 1253 (10th Cir. 2005)),
and the timeline shows multiple, related predicate acts over a substantial
period (¶¶ 1–93). I. Pattern of Racketeering Activity: Relatedness and
Continuity The predicate acts were not isolated incidents but part of an
ongoing scheme. The acts were related in that they all aimed to deprive the
Plaintiff of his property and business, and they posed a threat of continued
criminal activity, as the enterprise continued to operate and adapt its tactics
over time (¶¶ 1–93). The timeline shows that the enterprise’s activities
extended over a substantial period, with multiple acts occurring over
months and involving ongoing coordination and adaptation to changing
circumstances. J. Injury to Business or Property Plaintiff suffered direct and
ongoing injury to his business and property as a result of the enterprise’s
actions. He was deprived of his home and business operations, lost access to
marital funds, and was unable to provide services to clients, resulting in
financial harm (¶¶ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 37). These injuries are precisely the type
of harm RICO is designed to redress. Plains Resources, Inc. v. Gable, 782 F.
2d 883 (10th Cir. 1986)). K. Participation of Other Defendants: Inadvertent
or Willing The timeline raises the question of whether Munford, Kaitcer,
Carter, and Baker were victims of the initial scheme or willing participants
in the expanded enterprise. The evidence suggests that, at a minimum,
Myers and Branthoover were the core members of the enterprise, with
others potentially becoming involved through their actions in the legal
proceedings (¶¶ 14–93). i. Inadvertent Participation: Some defendants may
have participated inadvertently, such as by issuing orders or facilitating
court processes without knowledge of the underlying scheme (¶¶ 14–93). ii.
Willing Participation: Others may have become willing participants if they
knowingly furthered the enterprise’s objectives or ignored clear evidence of
fraud and misrepresentation (¶¶ 14–93). RICO does not impose liability for
inadvertent or unwitting participation; there must be knowing and willful
involvement in the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs. For the forthcoming
reasons, Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants are willing participants in the
scheme. VICTIM OR PARTICIPANT RICO liability extends to those who
knowingly participate in the conduct of the enterprise’s affairs, even if they
were not original members (RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31)). The timeline
raises the question of whether Munford, Kaitcer, Carter, and Baker were
victims of the initial scheme or willing participants in the expanded
enterprise. The evidence suggests that, at a minimum, Myers and
Branthoover were the core members of the enterprise, with others becoming
involved through their actions in the legal proceedings (¶¶ 14–93). The
timeline demonstrates that Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers engaged in extortion
by leveraging the threat of adverse legal action, fraudulent court orders, and
the manipulation of judicial process to coerce Plaintiff into relinquishing
property and business interests, satisfying the elements of extortion as a
predicate act under RICO and the Travel Act. Munford and Baker, for their
part, committed wire fraud by intentionally sending altered or incomplete
court documents via interstate email, with the intent to mislead, obstruct
relief, and further the enterprise’s objective of finalizing the divorce and
depriving Plaintiff of his property, thus meeting the requirements for wire
fraud as a RICO predicate act. These acts, as detailed in the timeline, are
not isolated but part of a coordinated pattern of racketeering activity within
an association-in-fact enterprise, as required by RICO in the Tenth Circuit.
The conduct of each defendant is tied to specific predicate acts—extortion

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
for Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers (notably at timeline events 33–37), and wire
fraud for Munford and Baker (notably at events 54–59, 83)—demonstrating
knowing and willful participation in the enterprise’s broader scheme to
deprive Plaintiff of his home and business through fraudulent and coercive
means. A. Extortion and Wire Fraud The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968, provides a civil cause of
action for injury to business or property caused by a pattern of racketeering
activity conducted through an enterprise affecting interstate commerce.
Predicate acts under RICO include extortion (as defined by the Hobbs Act
and the Travel Act) and wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343), among others.
Extortion is defined as obtaining property from another, with his consent,
induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or
under color of official right. The Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1952, includes
extortion as an “unlawful activity” and does not require it to be part of a
business enterprise (U.S. v. Welch, 327 F.3d 1081 (10th Cir. 2003)). The
Tenth Circuit recognizes that extortion under the Travel Act can be
established by showing threats or coercion to obtain something of value,
including property or legal rights, in violation of state or federal law. Wire
fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 requires (1) a scheme to defraud or obtain
property by false or fraudulent pretenses, (2) intent to defraud, and (3) use
of interstate wire communications to execute the scheme (Clinton v. Sec.
Benefit Life Ins. Co., 63 F.4th 1264 (10th Cir. 2023); United States v.
Holloway, 826 F.3d 1237 (10th Cir. 2016)). The Tenth Circuit requires that
the deprivation of property be a central object of the scheme, and that the
use of wires (including email) be knowing and in furtherance of the
fraudulent scheme (United States v. Tao, 629 F.Supp.3d 1083). B. Extortion
by Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers Extortion, as a RICO predicate act, is defined
broadly under federal law and the Travel Act. It includes obtaining property
or rights through threats, coercion, or misuse of official process (U.S. v.
Welch, 327 F.3d 1081 (10th Cir. 2003)). The Tenth Circuit does not require
extortion to be part of a business enterprise for Travel Act purposes; a single
act suffices if it has the requisite interstate nexus. The timeline shows the
following: i. Event 33–34: Carter, with Myers, prepared and presented
“Temporary Orders” that misrepresented facts (e.g., that Plaintiff agreed to
terms he did not, that a hearing occurred when it did not, and that the
orders were in the best interests of the children). These orders altered the
dates of access to the home to shield Myers from liability for locking Plaintiff
out, and were presented to Plaintiff in a context where he was under threat
of losing his home and business. iii. Event 36: Kaitcer, knowing the orders
were disputed and that no response had been filed, signed an associate
judge’s report pre-drafted by Carter, summarily denying Plaintiff’s
emergency motion and ordering Plaintiff to sign the disputed document,
despite his objections and lack of consent. iv. Event 35: Plaintiff refused to
sign the orders for multiple reasons, including their fraudulent content and
the lack of due process, but the orders were rendered into effect without his
signature. These acts collectively demonstrate the use of legal process and
the threat of adverse judicial action to coerce Plaintiff into surrendering his
property and business interests. The manipulation of court orders, the
misrepresentation of facts, and the pressure to sign under threat of losing
his home constitute extortion under the Travel Act and RICO (U.S. v. Welch,
327 F.3d 1081 (10th Cir. 2003). Myers’s role is clear: she was the beneficiary
and instigator of the fraudulent filings and the manipulation of court

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
process, using the threat of legal action and the actual deprivation of
Plaintiff’s property to achieve her goal. Carter and Kaitcer acted in concert
with Myers, knowingly facilitating the extortion by preparing, presenting,
and enforcing fraudulent orders, and by using the authority of the court to
coerce Plaintiff. The fact that Plaintiff was ordered to sign a document he
objected to, under threat of continued deprivation of his home and business,
is classic extortion by color of official right. All three defendants knew that
Plaintiff did not agree to the order, as he had just fired his attorney to
challenge any basis for an agreement. This implies that despite the motion
being served on all defendants, they chose to ignore the allegations of a
fraudulent scheme and further the affairs of the enterprise. These actions
meet the requirements for extortion as a RICO predicate act: they involved
the wrongful use of threats and official process to obtain property (the home
and business) from Plaintiff, with his consent induced by fear of further loss
or legal harm. The acts were not isolated but part of a coordinated scheme
to achieve the enterprise’s goal of finalizing the divorce and divesting
Plaintiff of his property B. Wire Fraud by Munford and Baker Wire fraud
under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 requires a scheme to defraud, intent to defraud, and
use of interstate wire communications to execute the scheme (Clinton v. Sec.
Benefit Life Ins. Co., 63 F.4th 1264 (10th Cir. 2023); United States v.
Holloway, 826 F.3d 1237 (10th Cir. 2016)). The Tenth Circuit recognizes that
sending altered or incomplete court documents via email, with the intent to
mislead or deprive someone of property or rights, can constitute wire fraud
if the deprivation of property is a central object of the scheme (United
States v. Tao, 629 F.Supp.3d 1083). The timeline shows the following: i.
Event 54: Munford signed and forwarded a “Joint Motion to Recuse”
attached to his order of referral, but the document was missing critical
exhibits and affidavits necessary for Plaintiff’s relief. ii. Event 55: Baker sent
a copy of this incomplete filing via email, representing it as the full
document. iii. Event 56–57: When Plaintiff pointed out the discrepancies,
Baker provided inconsistent explanations, first claiming the full document
was e-filed, then later stating it was split into three parts due to size. iv.
Event 58: Munford signed and filed an “Amended Order of Referral” with the
full motion attached, but with hyperlinks and bookmarks removed, further
impairing the document’s integrity. v. Event 59, 83: Baker continued to
forward altered or incomplete orders and referrals, even when procedural
irregularities were raised. These acts involved the knowing use of interstate
email to transmit altered or incomplete court documents, with the intent to
prevent Plaintiff from obtaining relief and to further the enterprise’s goal of
finalizing the divorce and depriving Plaintiff of his property. The use of email
to transmit these documents satisfies the interstate wire requirement, and
the intent to defraud is evidenced by the deliberate alteration and
misrepresentation of the filings. The conduct of Munford and Baker meets
the elements of wire fraud: (1) a scheme to defraud Plaintiff of property and
rights, (2) intent to defraud by preventing relief and misleading the court
and Plaintiff, and (3) use of interstate wire communications (email) to
execute the scheme (Clinton v. Sec. Benefit Life Ins. Co., 63 F.4th 1264 (10th
Cir. 2023)). The deprivation of property (Plaintiff’s home and business) was
a central object of the scheme, not a minor part. RELATIONSHIP AND
CONTINUITY All these acts—extortion by Carter, Kaitcer, and Myers, and
wire fraud by Munford and Baker—were committed in furtherance of the
Myers-Branthoover enterprise’s overarching objective: to finalize the

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
divorce and divest Plaintiff of his home and business. The acts were
coordinated, continuous, and related, satisfying the RICO pattern
requirement. The timeline shows that each defendant’s conduct was not an
isolated error or routine administrative act, but part of a deliberate scheme
to use the legal process, threats, and fraudulent communications to achieve
the enterprise’s unlawful goals. DAMAGES The harm inflicted upon Plaintiff
is staggering. He has lost the home in which he lived for nearly a third of his
life, the companionship of his spouse, and the society of his children. His
income has collapsed. For two years he has been consigned to a futile
appellate gauntlet, even as Defendants Munford, Kaitcer, Baker, and Carter
have repeatedly exceeded the bounds of their lawful authority in furtherance
of a broader scheme. What began as a concerted effort by Myers and
Branthoover to dispossess Plaintiff of his residence and property
metastasized into a calculated plan to procure a final decree of divorce once
the initial objective had been achieved. The objective was plain: by
engineering a final decree, Defendants would not only hobble Plaintiff’s
ability to bring this suit but also invite invocation of the Rooker–Feldman
doctrine and related abstention principles to preclude federal jurisdiction.
Now, after two years of unremitting effort, Plaintiff seeks the only
meaningful remedy remaining: federal redress to halt the ongoing abuses of
authority, to unwind tainted actions, and to compensate him fully for the
catastrophic losses Defendants have wrought. Take each piece in the TABLE
OF CONTENTS, research the topic, and tie it to the factual timeline, filling
out each element of the RICO complaint and tie each element to the factual
allegations by enumerated paragraph number. What are the standards for
incorporating and referencing public records and judicial notice in federal
civil litigation, particularly in the Fifth Circuit, and how should these be
pleaded in a RICO complaint?
Answer (Fifth Circuit)
Short response
In the Fifth Circuit, federal courts may incorporate and reference public
records and take judicial notice of them under Federal Rule of Evidence 201,
provided the records are not subject to reasonable dispute and are either
generally known or can be accurately determined from reliable sources; this
includes court filings and records from other proceedings. In a RICO
complaint, such records should be specifically identified, incorporated by
reference if central to the claims, and judicial notice should be expressly
requested in the pleadings, clarifying that the notice is sought for the
existence and authenticity of the records, not for the truth of their contents.
Summary
Federal courts in the Fifth Circuit routinely allow parties to incorporate
public records into pleadings and request judicial notice of such records,
especially in the context of motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). The
standards require that the records be referenced in the complaint, central to
the claims, and not subject to reasonable dispute, with judicial notice limited

to the existence and authenticity of the records rather than the truth of any
factual findings within them.
When pleading a RICO complaint, plaintiffs should clearly identify and
hyperlink or attach the relevant public records, state their centrality to the
RICO elements (such as predicate acts or enterprise structure), and formally
request judicial notice under Rule 201, specifying that the records are being
used to establish the fact of litigation or related filings. Courts will not take
judicial notice of disputed facts or factual findings from other courts, but will
recognize the existence and filing of public documents, which can be critical
in establishing the timeline, pattern, and continuity required for RICO
claims.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
The primary authority governing judicial notice in federal civil litigation is
Federal Rule of Evidence 201. This rule permits courts to take judicial notice
of facts that are not subject to reasonable dispute, either because they are
generally known within the court’s territorial jurisdiction or can be
accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot
reasonably be questioned. Judicial notice may be taken at any stage of the
proceeding, and the nonmoving party must be given an opportunity to be
heard regarding the propriety of judicial notice (United States v.
Psychosomatic Fitness LLC, 14 OCAHO no. 1387).
Federal Rule of Evidence 1005 further allows the use of certified copies of
official records, provided the record is otherwise admissible and the copy is
properly certified or authenticated (Other Evidence Rules (2019-05-05)).
Case Law
The Fifth Circuit has consistently held that courts may consider the
complaint, documents attached to the complaint, documents incorporated by
reference, and matters of public record when ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6)
motion to dismiss (Mitchell v. Prestige Default Servs., 3:23-cv-2534-X-BN
(N.D. Tex. Jun 06, 2024); Walker v. U.S. Bank (N.D. Tex. 2022); Wright v.
Arlington Indep. Sch. Dist., Civil Action No. 4:19-cv-00278-P (N.D. Tex. Nov
25, 2019)). Public records, including court filings from other cases, are
proper subjects of judicial notice, but the notice is limited to the existence
and authenticity of the documents, not the truth of their contents or the
factual findings of another court (Taylor v. Charter Medical Corp., 162 F.3d
827 (5th Cir. 1998); Gray ex rel. Rudd v. Beverly Enterprises-Miss., 390 F.3d
400 (5th Cir. 2004)).
Courts may also consider documents attached to a defendant’s motion to
dismiss if they are referenced in the complaint and central to the plaintiff’s
claims (Kaye v. (us), 453 B.R. 645 (N.D. Tex. 2011); Payne v. City of Houston
(2025-04-03)). The Fifth Circuit has clarified that taking judicial notice of
public records does not convert a motion to dismiss into a motion for

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
summary judgment (Cinel v. Connick, 15 F.3d 1338 (5th Cir. 1994); Munoz v.
HSBC Bank USA, N.A. (2013-01-22)).
The presumption of public access to judicial records is strong, and courts
should be reluctant to seal such records (Binh Hoa Le v. Exeter Fin. Corp.,
990 F.3d 410 (5th Cir. 2021)).
Administrative Decisions
Administrative decisions reinforce that judicial notice under Rule 201 is
limited to facts not subject to reasonable dispute and that parties must be
given an opportunity to contest judicial notice if they wish (United States v.
Psychosomatic Fitness LLC, 14 OCAHO no. 1387).
Analysis
Incorporating and Referencing Public Records
1. Incorporation by Reference
A plaintiff may incorporate public records into a complaint by specifically
referencing them and, where possible, attaching them or providing
hyperlinks. The records must be central to the claims asserted. For example,
in a RICO complaint, public records such as court filings, affidavits, and
orders that document the alleged predicate acts, the existence of an
enterprise, or the continuity of conduct are typically central to the claim
(Payne v. City of Houston (2025-04-03); Bustos v. Invierte En Tex.
(2024-06-03)).
Documents attached to the complaint or to a motion to dismiss may be
considered by the court if they are referenced in the complaint and central
to the claims (Kaye v. (us), 453 B.R. 645 (N.D. Tex. 2011)). This is
particularly relevant in complex RICO litigation, where the factual timeline
and the existence of predicate acts may be established through a series of
public records.
2. Judicial Notice
Federal courts in the Fifth Circuit may take judicial notice of public records,
including court filings from other cases, to establish the fact that certain
litigation or filings occurred (LUV N' Care, Ltd. v. Jackel Int'l Ltd., 502
F.Supp.3d 1106 (W.D. La. 2020); Starrett v. City of Richardson, Civil Action
No. 3:18-CV-0191-L (N.D. Tex. Jul 27, 2018)). However, courts will not take
judicial notice of the truth of the matters asserted in those records or the
factual findings of another court (Taylor v. Charter Medical Corp., 162 F.3d
827 (5th Cir. 1998); Ambler v. Williamson Cnty., Case No. 1-20-CV-1068-LY
(W.D. Tex. Feb 25, 2021)).
Judicial notice is appropriate only for facts that are not subject to reasonable
dispute, such as the existence of a court order, the filing of a pleading, or the
occurrence of a judicial act (Basic Capital Mgmt. v. Dynex Capital, Inc., Civil

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Action No. 3:17-CV-01147-X (N.D. Tex. Oct 28, 2019); Scanlan v. Texas a&M
University, 343 F.3d 533 (5th Cir. 2003)). The court may take judicial notice
on its own or upon request by a party, provided the party supplies the
necessary information (Roe v. E. Baton Rouge Par. Sch. Bd. (2024-10-03)).
3. Pleading Standards in a RICO Complaint
In a RICO complaint, the plaintiff should:
Clearly identify each public record being referenced, including docket
numbers, filing dates, and, where possible, hyperlinks to the records.
State that the records are incorporated by reference and are central to
the RICO claims, such as establishing the timeline of predicate acts, the
structure of the enterprise, or the continuity of conduct.
Formally request that the court take judicial notice of the records under
Federal Rule of Evidence 201, specifying that the request is for the
existence and authenticity of the records, not for the truth of any
factual findings within them.
If the records are from other court proceedings, clarify that judicial
notice is sought only for the fact of the filings or orders, not for the
underlying factual determinations (Murphy v. HSBC Bank USA, CIVIL
ACTION NO. H-12-3278 (S.D. Tex. Apr 23, 2014)).
For example, in the provided scenario, the plaintiff references the
consolidated mandamus record filed in the Texas Supreme Court, provides
hyperlinks, and requests judicial notice of the record’s existence and
authenticity, not the truth of the allegations within those filings.
4. Application to the Factual Timeline and RICO Elements
Each element of the RICO claim—such as the existence of an enterprise, the
commission of predicate acts, the pattern and continuity of racketeering
activity, and the injury to business or property—can be supported by public
records, provided they are properly referenced and incorporated. For
instance:
The timeline of events (e.g., filings, orders, communications) can be
established by referencing the public court records and attaching or
linking to them.
Predicate acts such as wire fraud or extortion may be documented
through affidavits, court orders, or filings that are part of the public
record.
The structure and continuity of the enterprise may be shown through a
series of related filings and orders over time.
By incorporating these records and requesting judicial notice, the plaintiff
ensures that the court may consider them at the motion to dismiss stage
without converting the motion into one for summary judgment (Munoz v.
HSBC Bank USA, N.A. (2013-01-22); Petri v. Properties, CIVIL ACTION
H-09-3994 (S.D. Tex. Jun 02, 2011)).

5. Limitations and Cautions
Courts will not take judicial notice of the truth of disputed facts or the
factual findings of another court, as these are not considered indisputable
under Rule 201 (Taylor v. Charter Medical Corp., 162 F.3d 827 (5th Cir.
1998)). If a party seeks judicial notice of facts that are subject to reasonable
dispute, the court will deny the request (Aubrey v. D Magazine Partners,
L.P., CIVIL ACTION NO. 3:19-CV-0056-B (N.D. Tex. Jan 23, 2020)).
When referencing public records, the plaintiff should avoid relying on the
records to prove the truth of the matters asserted within them, unless those
facts are independently admissible and not subject to reasonable dispute.
Exceptions and Caveats
Judicial notice is limited to facts not subject to reasonable dispute. If
the authenticity or accuracy of a public record is challenged, the court
may decline to take judicial notice.
The court will not take judicial notice of the factual findings of another
court, only the existence of the filings or orders.
If a public record is not central to the claim or is not referenced in the
complaint, it may not be considered at the motion to dismiss stage.
The party opposing judicial notice must be given an opportunity to
contest the propriety of judicial notice (United States v. Psychosomatic
Fitness LLC, 14 OCAHO no. 1387).
Conclusion
In the Fifth Circuit, federal courts may incorporate and reference public
records and take judicial notice of them under Federal Rule of Evidence 201,
provided the records are not subject to reasonable dispute and are either
generally known or can be accurately determined from reliable sources. In a
RICO complaint, plaintiffs should specifically identify and incorporate by
reference any public records central to their claims, formally request
judicial notice for the existence and authenticity of those records, and clarify
that the request does not extend to the truth of any factual findings within
the records. This approach ensures that the court may consider the records
at the motion to dismiss stage, supports the factual basis for the RICO
elements, and aligns with established Fifth Circuit precedent.

As noted, on a Rule 12(b)(6) review, although generally the court may not
look beyond the pleadings, the Court may examine the complaint,
documents attached to the complaint, and documents attached to the motion
to dismiss to which the complaint refers and which are central to the
plaintiff's claim(s), as well as matters of public record. Lone Star Fund V.
(U.S.), L.P. v. Barclays Bank PLC, 594 F.3d 383 (5th Cir. 2010), citing Collins,

Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, during a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the court can
consider the complaint, documents attached to the complaint, documents
attached to the motion to dismiss that are referred to in the complaint and
central to the plaintiff's claims, and matters of public record. This indicates
that public records can be incorporated into pleadings if they are central to
the claims and referenced in the complaint.
Kaye v. (us), 453 B.R. 645 (N.D. Tex. 2011)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Texas
Extract
Scanlan v. Tex. A & M Univ., 343 F.3d 533, 536 (5th Cir.2003). Under that
exception, “ ‘documents that a defendant attaches to a motion to dismiss are
considered part of the pleadings if they are referred to in the plaintiff's
complaint and are central to her claim.’ ” Collins, 224 F.3d at 498–99
(quoting Venture Assocs. Corp. v. Zenith Data Sys. Corp., 987 F.2d 429, 431
(7th Cir.1993)). Thus, for a document to be incorporated into the pleadings
under this exception, it must (1) be attached to a defendant's motion to
dismiss, (2) be referred to in the plaintiff's complaint, and (3) be central to
the plaintiff's claims.
Summary
Criteria for incorporating documents into pleadings in the Fifth Circuit. It
specifies that documents can be considered part of the pleadings if they are
attached to a motion to dismiss, referred to in the plaintiff's complaint, and
central to the plaintiff's claims. This is relevant for pleading in a RICO
complaint as it provides guidance on how to properly incorporate and
reference public records and judicial notice.

records in ... prior state court proceedings." Stiel v. Heritage Numismatic
Auctions, Inc., 816 F. App'x 888, 892 (5th Cir. 2020) (citation omitted). The
Court may also properly take judicial notice of "the fact that a judicial action

162 F.3d at 830) ("A court may take judicial notice of a document filed in
another court ... to establish the fact of such litigation and related filings")
(internal quotations omitted).
Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, it is proper for courts to take judicial notice of matters of
public record, including documents from prior state court proceedings, to
establish the fact of such litigation and related filings. This is applicable in
federal civil litigation, including RICO complaints, where public records can
be referenced to support claims.

Summary
Federal courts in the Fifth Circuit can take judicial notice of matters of
public record, including state court records, when deciding motions to
dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). This is supported by precedents such as Davis
v. Bayless and Landry v. Lynaugh, which affirm the permissibility of referring
to public records in federal court proceedings.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
We note our agreement with the following rationale given by the Second
Circuit for allowing district courts to take judicial notice of relevant public
disclosure documents: ... Foreclosing resort to such documents might lead to
complaints filed solely to extract nuisance settlements. Finally, we believe
that under such circumstances, a district court may take judicial notice of
the contents of relevant public disclosure documents required to be filed
with the SEC as facts 'capable of accurate and ready determination by resort
to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.' FED.R.EVID.
201(b)(2). This of course includes related documents that bear on the
adequacy of the disclosure as well as documents actually alleged to contain
inadequate or misleading statements. We stress that our holding relates to
public disclosure documents required by law to be filed, and actually filed,
with the SEC, and not to other forms of disclosure such as press releases or
announcements at shareholder meetings.
Summary
The Fifth Circuit allows district courts to take judicial notice of public
disclosure documents required by law to be filed with the SEC. These
documents are considered facts "capable of accurate and ready
determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be
questioned" under FED.R.EVID. 201(b)(2). This standard is applicable to
documents that are legally required to be filed and actually filed, ensuring
their reliability and accuracy.

Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, it is appropriate for courts to take judicial notice of

In ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the court generally limits its review to
the face of the pleadings. See Spivey v. Robertson, 197 F.3d 772, 774 (5th
Cir. 1999). However, the court may also consider documents outside of the
pleadings if they fall within certain limited categories. Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor
Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 323 (2007). Specifically, the court can
'rely on documents incorporated into the complaint by reference and
matters of which a court may take judicial notice.' Id. 'A judicially noticed
fact must be one not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either (1)
generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2)
capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose
accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.'
Summary
Standards for incorporating and referencing public records and judicial
notice in federal civil litigation. It specifies that courts can consider
documents outside the pleadings if they are incorporated by reference or
are matters of judicial notice. Judicial notice is reserved for facts that are
not subject to reasonable dispute, either because they are generally known
within the jurisdiction or can be accurately determined from reliable
sources. This is applicable in the context of a RICO complaint as it guides
how public records should be pleaded and referenced.

Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, it is proper for courts to take judicial notice of matters of
public record when evaluating the sufficiency of a complaint. This includes
documents incorporated by reference and agency records and reports,
provided there is no reason for mistrust. This standard applies to motions to
dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) and does not convert such motions into motions
for summary judgment.

Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, when conducting a 12(b)(6) analysis, courts generally
consider the complaint, documents attached to the complaint, and
documents attached to the motion that are central to the claim and
referenced by the complaint. Additionally, courts may take judicial notice of
matters of public record, such as pleadings filed with a state district court.
This is relevant for pleading in a RICO complaint, as it suggests that public

Summary
The Fifth Circuit emphasizes the public's right to access judicial proceedings

The Supreme Court has explained that, in considering Rule 12(b)(6)
motions, 'courts must consider the complaint in its entirety, as well as other
sources courts ordinarily examine when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions to
dismiss, in particular, documents incorporated into the complaint by

Rule 201 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, '[t]he court may judicially notice
a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it can be accurately
and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be
questioned.' Moreover, '[t]he court may take judicial notice on its own.' ...
The court may also take notice of matters of public record. Here, the
documents referenced are pleadings filed with and judgments rendered in a

The passage explains that in federal civil litigation, particularly when
considering Rule 12(b)(6) motions, courts can consider the complaint,
documents incorporated by reference, and matters of which a court may
take judicial notice. Rule 201 of the Federal Rules of Evidence allows courts
to take judicial notice of facts that are not subject to reasonable dispute and
can be accurately determined from reliable sources. The Fifth Circuit has

In determining whether a plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to survive a
motion to dismiss, 'the factual information to which the court addresses its
inquiry is limited to the (1) [ ] facts set forth in the complaint, (2) documents
attached to the complaint, and (3) matters of which judicial notice may be
taken under Federal Rule of Evidence 201.' Walker v. Beaumont Indep. Sch.

consider documents attached to a defendant's motion to dismiss 'that are
referred to in the complaint and are central to the plaintiff's claims.' Walker,
938 F.3d at 735. Federal Rule of Evidence 201(b) provides that courts 'may
judicially notice a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it:
(1) is generally known within the trial court's territorial jurisdiction; or (2)
can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy
cannot reasonably be questioned.' Rule 201 'authorizes the court to take
notice only of 'adjudicative facts,' not legal determinations.' Taylor v. Charter
Med. Corp., 162 F.3d 827, 831 (5th Cir. 1998). Judicial notice may be taken
of 'matters of public record' that are not subject to reasonable dispute.
Walker, 938 F.3d at 735; FED. R. EVID. 201(b). The court's notice, however,
is limited to the existence of the document, 'not to prove the truth of the
documents' contents.'
Summary
Standards for incorporating and referencing public records and judicial
notice in federal civil litigation, particularly in the Fifth Circuit. It specifies
that judicial notice can be taken of facts that are not subject to reasonable
dispute, such as those generally known within the court's jurisdiction or
those that can be accurately determined from reliable sources. The passage
also clarifies that judicial notice is limited to the existence of the document
and not to prove the truth of its contents. This is relevant for pleading in a

the statements they contain and not to prove the truth of the contents in the
documents. In Meyers v. Textron, Inc., the Fifth Circuit stated that district
courts, when ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, must primarily look at the
allegations in the complaint but may also take into account 'documents
incorporated into the complaint by reference or integral to the claim, items
subject to judicial notice, [including] matters of public record, orders, items
appearing in the record of the case, and exhibits attached to the complaint
whose authenticity is unquestioned.' Fifth Circuit precedent makes clear
that 'public records' includes publicly available documents and transcripts
and pleadings filed in state court.
Summary
Public records include documents and pleadings filed in state court, and
these can be incorporated into a complaint by reference or if they are
integral to the claim.

In assessing whether a plaintiff's claims survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to
dismiss, 'the factual information to which the court addresses its inquiry is
limited to (1) the facts set forth in the complaint, (2) documents attached to
the complaint, and (3) matters of which judicial notice may be taken under
Federal Rule of Evidence 201.' Walker v. Beaumont Indep. Sch. Dist., 938 F.
3d 724, 735 (5th Cir. 2019) (citations omitted). The Court also may consider
documents that a defendant attaches to its motion, so long as the documents
are referred to in the complaint and are central to the plaintiff's claims. ...
The Federal Rules of Evidence provide that the court 'may judicially notice a
fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it: (1) is generally
known within the trial court's territorial jurisdiction; or (2) can be accurately
and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be
questioned.' FED. R. EVID. 201(b). A court may take judicial notice on its
own or if a party requests it and the court is supplied with the necessary
information. FED. R. EVID. 201(c). 'Judicial notice may be taken of matters

may take judicial notice of court pleadings in other cases because they
constitute public records.
Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, when assessing a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6),
the court can consider facts in the complaint, attached documents, and
matters subject to judicial notice under Federal Rule of Evidence 201.
Judicial notice can be taken for facts not subject to reasonable dispute,
either because they are generally known or can be accurately determined
from reliable sources. Public records, including court pleadings from other
cases, can be judicially noticed. This is relevant for pleading in a RICO
complaint as it allows the incorporation of public records and judicial notice
to support claims.
Binh Hoa Le v. Exeter Fin. Corp., 990 F.3d 410 (5th Cir. 2021)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
Judicial records are public records. And public records, by definition,
presume public access. ... In our view, courts should be ungenerous with
their discretion to seal judicial records, which plays out in two legal
standards relevant here. The first standard, requiring only 'good cause,'
applies to protective orders sealing documents produced in discovery. The
second standard, a stricter balancing test, applies '[o]nce a document is filed
on the public record'—when a document 'becomes a ‘judicial record.’' Under
both standards, the working presumption is that judicial records should not
be sealed. That must be the default because the opposite would be
unworkable: 'With automatic sealing, the public may never know a
document has been filed that might be of interest.'
Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, there is a strong presumption in favor of public access to
judicial records. This presumption applies to documents filed on the public
record, which become judicial records. The court should be cautious in
sealing such records, applying a stricter balancing test once a document is
filed publicly. This principle is crucial for ensuring transparency and public
awareness of judicial proceedings.

Extract
Subsequently, Plaintiffs filed the motion at hand, asking the Court to take
judicial notice of the contents of six search-warrant affidavits, because
Plaintiffs included allegations of only three search-warrant affidavits in their
second amended complaint. See Doc. 98, Pls.' Mot. for Leave, 1-2. Defendant
Dallas County, as well as the City Defendants, filed responses in opposition
to the motion, contending that Plaintiffs urge the Court to take judicial
notice of facts that do not fall within the purview of Federal Rule of Evidence
201. See Doc. 99, Def. Dallas Cty.'s Resp., 3; Doc. 100, CityDefs.' Resp., 1-2.
Plaintiffs, in reply, assert that they seek judicial notice of the fact that
certain facts appear in the affidavits—not the truth of those facts. See Doc.
101, Pls.' Reply, 2. ... Here, Plaintiffs urge the Court to take judicial notice of
the existence of facts in certain search-warrant affidavits. Doc. 98, Pls.' Mot.
for Leave, 1-2. Because the existence of the statements in these search-
warrant affidavits cannot be 'accurately and readily determined from
sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned,' see FED. R.
EVID. 201(b)(2), the Court DENIES Plaintiffs' motion (Doc. 98). A. The Court
Will Not Take Judicial Notice of the Existence of Facts in the Search-Warrant
Affidavits. ... Here, the Court is not convinced that Plaintiffs' exhibits derive

attached exhibits—the search-warrant affidavits and related documents—do
not include the Request itself. See generally, Doc. 98-1, Pls.' Mot., Exs. A-C.
Accordingly, the Court 'is unable to determine, from the documents
provided, what exact information Plaintiff[s] requested from' the City of
Dallas.
Summary
For a court to take judicial notice of facts, the facts must be from sources
"whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned" as per Federal Rule of
Evidence 201(b)(2). The court denied the motion for judicial notice because
the plaintiffs did not provide sufficient evidence that the affidavits were from
such sources. This indicates that when pleading in a RICO complaint, or any
federal civil litigation, it is crucial to ensure that any public records or
documents for which judicial notice is sought must be clearly sourced and
their accuracy unquestionable.

Federal Rule of Evidence 201 allows a district court to take judicial notice of
a 'fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it (1) is generally
known within the trial court's territorial jurisdiction; or (2) can be accurately
and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be
questioned.' Fed. R. Evid. 201(b). A district court may take judicial notice of
a fact at the motion-to-dismiss stage of proceedings. Basic Cap. Mgmt., Inc.
v. Dynex Cap., Inc., 976 F.3d 585, 589 (5th Cir. 2020). Specifically, the Fifth
Circuit has stated that it is 'clearly proper' for a district court to take judicial
notice of matters of public record in deciding a 12(b)(6) motion.
Summary
The passage explains that under Federal Rule of Evidence 201, a district
court can take judicial notice of facts that are not subject to reasonable
dispute, either because they are generally known within the court's
jurisdiction or can be accurately determined from reliable sources. This is
applicable at the motion-to-dismiss stage, and the Fifth Circuit has affirmed
that it is proper to take judicial notice of public records in such contexts.

The Court further notes that Federal Rule of Evidence 201(b) allows the
Court to take judicial notice only of an adjudicative fact 'not subject to
reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) generally known within the
territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready
determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be
questioned.' Furthermore, Rule 201(g) states, 'In a civil action or
proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury to accept as conclusive any fact
judicially noticed.' 'A fact that has been judicially noticed is not subject to
dispute by the opposing party.' ... In Taylor Charter Medical Corp., 162 F.3d
827, 829-30 (5th Cir. 1998)(citations omitted), the Fifth Circuit joined the
Second and Eleventh Circuit Courts of Appeals in ruling that a court may
take judicial notice of a 'document filed in another court. .. to establish the
fact of such litigation and related filings,' but not of the factual findings of
another court because those do not constitute facts 'not subject to
reasonable dispute within the meaning of Rule 201 and because to do so
merely because a fact had been found to be true in some other action would
make the doctrine of collateral estoppel superfluous. A court may take
judicial notice of an order of another court only for the limited purpose of
recognizing the judicial act that the order represents.
Summary
In federal civil litigation, particularly in the Fifth Circuit, courts can take
judicial notice of adjudicative facts that are not subject to reasonable
dispute. This includes facts that are generally known within the court's
jurisdiction or can be accurately determined from reliable sources. Courts
can take judicial notice of documents filed in other courts to establish the
fact of litigation and related filings, but not the factual findings of those
courts. This is to prevent the doctrine of collateral estoppel from becoming
redundant. In a RICO complaint, these standards should be pleaded by
clearly identifying the public records and specifying that they are being used
to establish the fact of litigation or related filings, not to assert the truth of
the facts within those records.

Appellate review of a district court's dismissal for failure to state a claim
under Rule 12(b)(6) is de novo. Jones v. Greninger, 188 F.3d 322, 324 (5th

complaint states a valid claim when all well-pleaded facts are assumed true
and are viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. In re Katrina

Witter, 224 F.3d 496, 498-99 (5th Cir.2000).
Summary
Standards for reviewing a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) in the Fifth
Circuit. It emphasizes that the court's review is limited to the complaint and
any documents attached to it or to the motion to dismiss, provided they are
central to the claim and referenced by the complaint. This is relevant to
incorporating public records and judicial notice in federal civil litigation, as
it highlights the importance of attaching and referencing documents central
to the claim.
Taylor v. Charter Medical Corp., 162 F.3d 827 (5th Cir. 1998)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fifth Circuit
Extract
We have not previously addressed this precise issue, but the Second, Eighth,
and Eleventh Circuits have, holding that, even though a court may take
judicial notice of a 'document filed in another court ... to establish the fact of
such litigation and related filings,' a court cannot take judicial notice of the
factual findings of another court. This is so because (1) such findings do not
constitute facts 'not subject to reasonable dispute' within the meaning of
Rule 201; and (2) 'were [it] permissible for a court to take judicial notice of a
fact merely because it had been found to be true in some other action, the
doctrine of collateral estoppel would be superfluous.'
Summary
While courts can take judicial notice of the existence of documents filed in
other courts to establish the fact of litigation and related filings, they cannot
take judicial notice of the factual findings from those documents. This is
because such findings are not considered indisputable facts under Rule 201
of the Federal Rules of Evidence. The passage also highlights that allowing
judicial notice of factual findings would undermine the doctrine of collateral
estoppel.

Summary
For a fact to be judicially noticed in federal civil litigation, it must be either
generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or
capable of accurate and ready determination by sources whose accuracy
cannot reasonably be questioned. This standard is crucial for incorporating
public records into a RICO complaint, as it ensures that the facts being
noticed are not subject to reasonable dispute.

Accordingly, the consideration of the consent judgment does not convert this
motion into one for summary judgment.
Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, courts can refer to matters of public record when
deciding a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) without converting the
motion into one for summary judgment. This indicates that public records
can be incorporated into pleadings and considered by the court without
altering the nature of the motion. This is relevant for pleading in a RICO
complaint, as it suggests that public records can be referenced to support
the allegations without necessitating a summary judgment motion.

The district court identified twenty different categories of disputed sealed
documents. It then separated the categories into two groups. The first group
contained these categories: court filings in this case, a transcript of
proceedings in this case, correspondence between counsel, publicly
available articles, documents from the Louisiana Secretary of State's

website, information regarding published books, orders from the district
court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, court documents from other
cases, online information regarding abortion clinics, a publication from the
Knights of Columbus, a public records request, and a Declaration of a
Records Custodian. Even though, as the district court acknowledged,
'[m]uch of this information is already publicly available,' the district court
ordered substantial redaction of the documents in this group.
Summary
The district court recognized the public availability of certain documents but
still ordered redactions, highlighting the tension between public access and
privacy concerns. This suggests that in the Fifth Circuit, even publicly
available documents may be subject to redaction if privacy or other
concerns are present. This is relevant to how public records might be
incorporated into a RICO complaint, as it underscores the need to balance
transparency with privacy.

We may take judicial notice of another court's judicial action. See Karaha
Bodas Co. v. Perusahaan Perambangan Minyak Dan Gas Bumi Negara, 2003
WL 21027134, at *4 (5th Cir.2003). Although we cannot take judicial notice
of findings of fact of other courts, the fact that a judicial action was taken is
indisputable and is therefore amenable to judicial notice. See Taylor v.
Charter Med. Corp., 162 F.3d 827, 831 (5th Cir.1998). The defendants point
out that the motion effectively seeks to avoid this circuit's rule against
giving precedential value to unpublished opinions. That would be true if the
purpose for which plaintiffs seek to have the cases noticed were to establish
them as precedent. It is perfectly permissible, however, for us to take
judicial notice of the very fact of the judicial act that these decisions
represent. We therefore grant the motion.
Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, courts can take judicial notice of the fact that a judicial
action was taken by another court, but not the findings of fact from those
actions. This means that while the existence of a court decision can be
acknowledged, the specific factual determinations within that decision
cannot be used as evidence. This is important for pleading in a RICO
complaint, as it allows the plaintiff to reference the existence of prior
judicial actions without relying on the factual findings of those actions as
evidence.

The judgment in Plaintiff prior lawsuit can be judicially noticed because it is
a matter of public record and its contents cannot reasonably be disputed.
See Norris v. Hearst Trust, 500 F.3d 454, 461 n.9 (5th Cir. 2007) (stating

Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, courts can take judicial notice of matters of public
record, such as judgments from prior lawsuits, as long as their contents
cannot reasonably be disputed. This is supported by case law and the
Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 201(b)(2), which allows for
judicial notice of facts that can be accurately and readily determined from
reliable sources.
Payne v. City of Houston
Extract
Typically, in evaluating a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a court must
accept the well-pleaded facts in the complaint as true and not consider facts
outside the complaint. However, there are exceptions to this general rule,
two of which are relevant here: (1) the district court may consider
documents attached to the motion to dismiss if they are referred to in the
plaintiff's complaint and central to their claims (incorporation by reference);
and (2) the district court may take judicial notice of public records, though it
may not take judicial notice of 'adjudicative facts' subject to reasonable
dispute, which generally include the factual findings of another court.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the standards for incorporating and
referencing public records and judicial notice in federal civil litigation within
the Fifth Circuit. It explains that while courts typically do not consider facts
outside the complaint in a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, they may consider
documents attached to the motion if they are referred to in the complaint

Standards for incorporating public records and taking judicial notice in
federal civil litigation within the Fifth Circuit. It specifies that courts may
consider documents attached to the complaint, documents central to the
plaintiff's claims, and matters of public record without converting a motion
to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. Judicial notice is
appropriate for facts not subject to reasonable dispute, either because they

not reasonably disputable. This is relevant for a RICO complaint, where
public records might be used to establish elements of the claim, such as
predicate acts or the existence of an enterprise.

According to Federal Rule of Evidence 201, 'the [C]ourt may judicially notice
a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it: (1) is generally
known within the trial court's territorial jurisdiction; or (2) can be accurately
and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be

the proceeding.' Although the decision of whether to take judicial notice of a
fact is generally within the discretion of the trial court, a court 'must take
judicial notice if a party requests it and the court is supplied with the
necessary information.' As the School Board Defendants argue, courts have
recognized that 'Public records and government documents are generally
considered not to be subject to reasonable dispute,' and '[t]his includes
public records and government documents available from reliable sources
on the Internet.' Moreover, the Fifth Circuit in at least one case has taken
judicial notice of 'the subject matter and contents of' school board policies
cited by a party who moved to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).
Summary
Clear explanation of the standards for judicial notice under Federal Rule of
Evidence 201, emphasizing that courts may take judicial notice of facts not
subject to reasonable dispute, including public records and government
documents. It also highlights that the Fifth Circuit has recognized the
reliability of public records from the Internet for judicial notice purposes.

In addition, 'it is clearly proper in deciding a 12(b)(6) motion to take judicial
notice of matters of public record.' Norris v. Hearst Trust, 500 F.3d 454, 461
n.9 (5th Cir. 2007); accord Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551
U.S. 308, 322 (2008) (directing courts to 'consider the complaint in its
entirety, as well as other sources courts ordinarily examine when ruling on
Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss, in particular, documents incorporated into
the complaint by reference, and matters of which a court may take judicial
notice').
Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, it is proper for courts to take judicial notice of matters of
public record when deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. This includes
considering the complaint in its entirety and other sources such as
documents incorporated into the complaint by reference. This standard is
applicable to federal civil litigation and is relevant when pleading a RICO
complaint, as it allows the incorporation of public records to support the
claims.

Forster v. Bexar Cnty.
Extract
In general, a court addressing a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) 'must limit itself
to the contents of the pleadings, including attachments thereto.' Brand
Coupon Network, LLC v. Catalina Mktg. Corp., 748 F.3d 631, 635 (5th Cir.
2014) (citation omitted). And when a pleading refers to documents that are
central to a claim, the Court may consider such documents if attached to the
motion to dismiss. Lone Star Fund V (U.S.), LP v. Barclays Bank PLC, 594 F.
3d 383, 387 (5th Cir. 2010); Collins v. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, 224 F.3d
496, 498-99 (5th Cir. 2000). Additionally, the Court may consider judicially
noticed facts through Fed.R.Evid. 201, Basic Cap. Mgmt., Inc. v. Dynex Cap.,
Inc., 976 F.3d 585, 588 (5th Cir. 2020), and take judicial notice of matters of
public record, Norris v. Hearst Trust, 500 F.3d 454, 461 n.9 (5th Cir. 2007).
Summary
In the Fifth Circuit, when addressing a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)
(6), courts are generally limited to the contents of the pleadings and any
attachments. However, if a pleading refers to documents central to a claim,
those documents can be considered if attached to the motion to dismiss.
Additionally, courts can take judicial notice of facts under Federal Rule of
Evidence 201 and consider matters of public record. This is relevant for
pleading in a RICO complaint, as it suggests that public records and
judicially noticed facts can be incorporated into the complaint if they are
central to the claims being made.
Judicial Notice: An Underappreciated and Misapplied Tool of Efficiency.
Defense Counsel Journal - International Association of Defense
Counsels - Zogby, Michael C. - 2017-04-01
Extract
A judge may notice facts in upholding a complaint or in striking it as
insufficient. This could have a profound on the parties' ability to bring a case
to trial, or to bring a case in the first instance. Accordingly, unless a fact is
undisputable, judicial notice at the pre-trial stage is used much less
frequently than at trial. Application of judicial notice at the pre-trial phase is
simple. For example, in a motion to dismiss, a defendant can state they are
the holder of a new drug application filed with the Food and Drug
Administration ('FDA'). The defendant may then provide the court with legal
precedent that it can and should take judicial notice of such a fact. For
example, the defendant could cite legal precedent supporting the
proposition that a court may take judicial notice of FDA documents found
online because the website is a 'source whose accuracy cannot reasonably
be questioned.'

Summary
N example of how judicial notice can be applied at the pre-trial stage, such
as in a motion to dismiss, by referencing documents from a reliable source
like the FDA. This suggests that in a RICO complaint, a party could plead for
judicial notice by citing reliable public records or documents from sources
whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.
Vol. 50 No. 1 Pg. 0038 A Tangled Web the Developing Law of Judicial Notice
of Website Information
New Hampshire Bar Journal - New Hampshire Bar Association -
2009-00-00
Extract
Judicial notice of private (non-governmental) website information is more
frequently subject to dispute. Here, the inquiry may depend on who
maintains the website and what evidentiary use is intended for the
information obtained. In O'Toole v. Northrop Grumman Corp., 499 F.3d 1218
(10th Cir. 2007), the facts at issue concerned lost earnings after the plaintiff
employee withdrew money from a company retirement account. Despite the
defendant company's objection, the appellate court had little difficulty
affirming the taking of judicial notice by the trial court of the actual
earnings history published on the company's own website. The company had
no explanation 'why its own website's posting of historical retirement fund
earnings is unreliable.' The appellate court also noted the company could
have asked the trial court for a Rule 201(e) hearing on the issue, but did not
do so.
Summary
The passage highlights that judicial notice of website information, especially
from non-governmental sources, can be contentious. The court's decision to
take judicial notice may depend on the reliability of the source and the
intended use of the information. The example from the Tenth Circuit shows
that courts may take judicial notice of information from a company's own
website if the company cannot demonstrate its unreliability. This principle
can be applied in the Fifth Circuit as well, where courts may take judicial
notice of public records and reliable website information, provided the
opposing party does not successfully challenge its reliability.
Authenticity of archived websites: the need to lower the evidentiary hurdle
is imminent.

The Federal Rules of Evidence also permit authenticating evidence by ways
of 'describing a process or system and showing that it produces an accurate
result.' This does not mean, however, that it is always necessary for the
computer programmer to testify in order to authenticate computer-
generated documents. Anyone who has knowledge of the particular record
system in question may authenticate a computer printout. At least one court
has applied this rule to admit screenshots of archived web pages into
evidence.
Summary
The passage provides insight into the standards for authenticating
electronic evidence, such as archived web pages, in federal civil litigation. It
highlights that the Federal Rules of Evidence allow for authentication by
describing a process or system that produces an accurate result, and that
testimony from someone knowledgeable about the record system can suffice
for authentication. This is relevant to incorporating public records and
judicial notice in a RICO complaint, as it outlines how electronic evidence
can be authenticated and admitted in court.
Other Evidence Rules
Trial Evidence Foundations - James Publishing - Gordon P. Cleary -
2019-05-05
Extract
Federal Rule of Evidence 1005 provides that: The proponent may use a copy
to prove the content of an official record — or of a document that was
recorded or filed in a public office as authorized by law — if these conditions
are met: the record or document is otherwise admissible; and the copy is
certified as correct in accordance with Rule 902(4) or is testified to be
correct by a witness who has compared it with the original. If no such copy
can be obtained, the proponent may use other evidence to prove the
content. Judicial notice may only be taken of a fact that is 'not subject to
reasonable dispute because it is (1) generally known within the trial court’s
territorial jurisdiction, or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by
resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.'
Summary
Conditions under which public records can be used in federal court,
emphasizing the need for certification or testimony to establish authenticity.
It also explains the criteria for judicial notice, which requires facts to be
indisputable or easily verifiable. These standards are relevant to pleading in
a RICO complaint, where public records and judicial notice may be used to
establish elements of the case.
