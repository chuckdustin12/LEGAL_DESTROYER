Question
The respondent was removed from his home and deprived of property
without a protective order being rendered, without findings, and without
evidence being presented, during a time when the court was officially
closed. The Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the deprivation of life, liberty,
or property without due process of law. Due process generally requires
notice and an opportunity to be heard before deprivation (Mathews v.
Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976)). If the respondent was deprived of property
(e.g., removal from his home) without a hearing, findings, or evidence, and
without an emergency justifying summary action, this may constitute a due
process violation actionable under § 1983.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
The removal of a respondent from their home and deprivation of property
without a protective order, findings, evidence, or a hearing—especially
absent an emergency—constitutes a likely violation of procedural due
process under the Fourteenth Amendment and Texas law. Such actions are
generally void and actionable under § 1983, as both statutory and case law
require notice, an opportunity to be heard, and specific findings before
depriving an individual of property.
Summary
Both the United States and Texas Constitutions prohibit the deprivation of
life, liberty, or property without due process of law, which fundamentally
requires notice and an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a
meaningful manner. Texas statutes governing exclusion from a residence
and protective orders further reinforce these constitutional protections by
mandating sworn affidavits, personal testimony, and judicial findings before
a person can be excluded from their home, with only narrow exceptions for
genuine emergencies.
In the scenario described, where a respondent was removed from their
home without a protective order, findings, evidence, or a hearing—and
during a period when the court was closed—there is no indication that
statutory or constitutional due process requirements were met. The absence
of an emergency or exigent circumstances further undermines any
justification for summary action, making the deprivation of property highly
likely to be unconstitutional and void, and providing grounds for a § 1983
claim.

Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
The Texas Family Code provides detailed procedures and requirements for
excluding a person from their residence or depriving them of property
interests in the context of family law disputes:
Tex. Fam. Code § 83.006 stipulates that a person may only be
excluded from their residence by a temporary ex parte order if the
applicant files a sworn affidavit detailing the facts and circumstances
necessitating exclusion and appears in person to testify at a temporary
ex parte hearing. The court must make specific findings based on the
affidavit and testimony, including recent family violence and a clear and
present danger of future violence, before issuing such an order.
Tex. Fam. Code § 85.021 authorizes the court to grant exclusive
possession of a residence in a protective order, but only after rendering
such an order and following the statutory requirements, which
implicitly include notice and an opportunity to be heard.
Tex. Fam. Code § 83.001 allows for a temporary ex parte order
without notice or a hearing only if the court finds a clear and present
danger of family violence based on the application.
Tex. Fam. Code § 262.102 governs emergency orders for possession
of a child, requiring a finding of immediate danger to the child’s
physical health or safety, and a lack of time for a full adversary hearing,
before a court may act without prior notice and hearing.
Tex. Fam. Code § 262.201 mandates a full adversary hearing within
14 days of a child’s removal, with the court required to make findings
based on sufficient evidence to justify continued deprivation.
These statutes collectively establish that, except in narrowly defined
emergencies, exclusion from a residence or deprivation of property must be
preceded by notice, a hearing, and judicial findings based on evidence.
Case Law
Texas courts, in line with federal constitutional principles, have consistently
held that due process requires notice and an opportunity to be heard before
the state may deprive an individual of property:
The Texas and U.S. Constitutions both prohibit deprivation of life,
liberty, or property without due process, and Texas courts interpret the
state’s “due course of law” provision as congruent with the federal “due
process” clause (Tojo Enters. v. Tex. Workforce Comm'n, 13-21-00210-
CV (Tex. App. Mar 09, 2023); Campbell v. Stucki, 220 S.W.3d 562 (Tex.
App. 2007)).

Due process is fundamentally about fairness and requires that affected
parties receive notice and an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful
time and in a meaningful manner (In re Interest of J.R., 652 S.W.3d 508
(Tex. App. 2022); Covarrubias v. Texas Department of Criminal Justice,
52 S.W.3d 318 (Tex. App. 2001); Simmons v. Outreach Health Cmty.
Care Servs., L.P., 511 S.W.3d 163 (Tex. App. 2014)).
Orders entered without due process are void, and deprivation of
property without due process violates both the U.S. and Texas
Constitutions (In re Keeling, 227 S.W.3d 391 (Tex. App. 2007)).
The opportunity to be heard must be meaningful, not merely formal or
perfunctory, and the right to notice cannot be overridden by legislative
expediency (In re L.D.C., NUMBER 13-17-00053-CV (Tex. App. Dec 13,
2018); In re E.R., 385 S.W.3d 552, 55 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1130 (Tex. 2012)).
Even in the context of temporary ex parte orders, Texas law requires a
mechanism for the affected party to seek a prompt, live evidentiary
hearing to vacate the order, and denial of such a hearing is a due
process violation (In re V.K., 607 S.W.3d 471 (Tex. App. 2020)).
The deprivation of property, such as exclusion from a home, is a
significant interest, and absent exigent circumstances, due process
requires prior notice and a hearing (Due Process [secondary]; Due
Process [secondary]).
Secondary Materials
Secondary sources reinforce these principles, emphasizing that due process
is not satisfied by mere formalities but requires real opportunities to contest
deprivation, especially when fundamental rights such as property or home
occupancy are at stake. They also highlight that the standard of proof and
adequacy of notice are critical to the fairness of the process (The
Unconstitutionality of Protective Orders Under the Texas Family Code – Part
I; The Unconstitutionality of Protective Orders Under the Texas Family Code
– Part II).
Analysis
Application of Law to the Scenario
The scenario describes a respondent who was removed from his home and
deprived of property without a protective order, findings, evidence, or a
hearing, and during a period when the court was closed. There is no
indication of an emergency or exigent circumstances justifying summary
action.
Statutory Requirements
Under Tex. Fam. Code § 83.006, exclusion from a residence by temporary
ex parte order requires a sworn affidavit, personal testimony, and specific
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
judicial findings regarding recent family violence and the likelihood of future
violence. The court must conduct a hearing, even if ex parte, and make
findings based on evidence. The absence of these steps—no affidavit, no
testimony, no findings, and no order—means the statutory requirements
were not met.
Tex. Fam. Code § 85.021 further requires that exclusive possession of a
residence be granted only by court order, following the statutory process. If
no protective order was rendered, the deprivation of property was
unauthorized.
Tex. Fam. Code § 83.001 allows for ex parte orders without notice or a
hearing only if there is a clear and present danger of family violence, which
must be supported by the application. Even then, the respondent has the
right to seek a prompt hearing to vacate the order (In re V.K., 607 S.W.3d
471 (Tex. App. 2020)).
In the context of child removal, Tex. Fam. Code § 262.102 and § 262.201
require immediate danger and a lack of time for a full hearing to justify
summary action, and mandate a full adversary hearing within 14 days. The
absence of an emergency or subsequent hearing would violate these
provisions.
Constitutional Due Process
The Fourteenth Amendment and the Texas Constitution both require that,
before the state deprives an individual of property, the person must receive
notice and an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a
meaningful manner (Tojo Enters. v. Tex. Workforce Comm'n, 13-21-00210-CV
(Tex. App. Mar 09, 2023); In re Interest of J.R., 652 S.W.3d 508 (Tex. App.
2022); Simmons v. Outreach Health Cmty. Care Servs., L.P., 511 S.W.3d 163
(Tex. App. 2014)). The opportunity to be heard must be real and not illusory,
and the process must be fair and appropriate to the nature of the
deprivation.
Where the deprivation is significant—such as exclusion from one’s home—
the courts have recognized that the risk of error is high if due process is not
observed, and that real property cannot be removed or hidden, so there is
rarely justification for bypassing due process (Due Process [secondary]).
Orders entered without due process are void and have no legal effect (In re
Keeling, 227 S.W.3d 391 (Tex. App. 2007)). The deprivation of property
without due process is actionable under § 1983, as it constitutes a violation
of constitutional rights.
No Emergency or Exigent Circumstances
The only recognized exception to the requirement for notice and a hearing is
in cases of genuine emergency, such as immediate danger of family violence
or harm to a child, and even then, the law requires prompt post-deprivation
hearings and judicial findings based on evidence (Tex. Fam. Code § 83.001; 

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Tex. Fam. Code § 262.102). In the absence of such circumstances, summary
deprivation is not permitted.
The scenario specifies that there was no emergency justifying summary
action, and the court was closed, further precluding any justification for
bypassing due process.
Burden of Proof and Adequacy of Process
Secondary materials highlight that, when fundamental rights are at stake,
the process must be robust, with adequate notice, time to prepare, and a
meaningful opportunity to contest the deprivation (The Unconstitutionality
of Protective Orders Under the Texas Family Code – Part I; The
Unconstitutionality of Protective Orders Under the Texas Family Code – Part
II). The mere possibility of family violence or unsupported allegations are
insufficient to justify deprivation without process.
Exceptions and Caveats
There are narrow exceptions to the requirement for notice and a hearing,
primarily in cases of immediate danger or exigent circumstances. Texas law
allows for temporary ex parte orders without notice or a hearing only if
there is a clear and present danger of family violence, supported by sworn
evidence, and even then, the respondent must have the opportunity to seek
a prompt hearing to vacate the order (Tex. Fam. Code § 83.001; In re V.K.,
607 S.W.3d 471 (Tex. App. 2020)).
If, in a particular case, there was a genuine emergency and the statutory
procedures for ex parte relief were followed, the deprivation might be
justified temporarily, but only if followed by a prompt adversary hearing and
judicial findings based on evidence. The absence of any such process, as in
the scenario described, removes any possible justification.
Conclusion
The removal of a respondent from their home and deprivation of property
without a protective order, findings, evidence, or a hearing—especially in the
absence of an emergency and during a period when the court was closed—
constitutes a clear violation of procedural due process under both the
Fourteenth Amendment and Texas law. Statutory and case law require
notice, an opportunity to be heard, and judicial findings based on evidence
before such deprivation can occur. Orders entered without due process are
void, and such actions are actionable under § 1983. The scenario described
presents a textbook case of a due process violation, with no statutory or
constitutional justification for the deprivation.

Texas Supreme Court
Extract
the system's covered employees cannot be discharged without just cause,
and thus they have a property interest in continued employment; the
deputies were discharged without the hearing before the civil service
commission promised by system rules to determine whether just cause
existed, and thus they were denied procedural due process; ... Rather, said
the court, the Manual gave covered employees a property interest of which
they could not be deprived without procedural due process guaranteed by
the Fourteenth Amendment. The process due, the court said, was that set
out in the Manual, including a hearing on their grievances. Since the only
hearing the deputies had been afforded was limited to whether they were
entitled to present their grievances, they had been denied procedural due
process and were entitled to the damages found by the jury.
Summary
Procedural due process rights of employees who have a property interest in
their employment. It emphasizes that such employees cannot be deprived of
their property interest without due process, which includes a hearing. This
is directly relevant to the proposition, as it supports the idea that
deprivation of property (such as removal from a home) without due process
(notice and a hearing) may constitute a violation of the Fourteenth
Amendment.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The concept of due process is, 'perhaps, the least frozen concept of our law
—the least confined to history and the most absorptive of powerful social
standards of a progressive society. But neither the unfolding content of `due
process' nor the particularized safeguards of the Bill of Rights disregard
procedural ways that reflect a national historic policy.' Against the historical
status quo, I read the Court's opinion to allow some weight to be given
countervailing considerations of fairness in operation, considerations much
like those we evaluated in Mathews [v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893,
47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976)].
Summary
The passage highlights the evolving nature of due process, emphasizing that
it is not rigidly confined to historical interpretations but is instead
influenced by contemporary standards of fairness. It references Mathews v.
Eldridge, a key case in due process jurisprudence, which supports the

proposition that due process requires notice and an opportunity to be heard
before deprivation of property. This aligns with the proposition that the
respondent's removal without due process could constitute a violation.

Accordingly, the statute cannot place a temporal limit on a challenge to a
void judgment filed by a defendant who did not receive the type of notice to
which she was constitutionally entitled. Despite the Legislature's intent to
expedite termination proceedings, it cannot do so at the expense of a
parent's constitutional right to notice.
Summary
The passage emphasizes the importance of constitutional due process rights,
specifically the right to notice, which cannot be overridden by statutory time
limits or legislative intent to expedite proceedings. This supports the
proposition that any deprivation of property or liberty without due process,
including notice and an opportunity to be heard, is a violation of
constitutional rights.

Summary
The passage highlights that both the Texas Constitution and the U.S.
Constitution protect individuals from being deprived of life, liberty, or
property without due process of law. The Texas Constitution's "due course of
law" is interpreted in line with the federal "due process" clause, meaning
that procedural due process protections are similarly applied in Texas. This
supports the proposition that the respondent's removal from his home
without due process could be a violation of constitutional rights.

The Due Process Clauses of the Texas Constitution and the Fourteenth
Amendment to the United States Constitution also serve as restraints on
legislative power in establishing procedural prerequisites to vindicating a
claim. The Fourteenth Amendment provides that '[n]o State shall ... deprive
any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law....' U.S.
CONST. Amend. XIV, § 1. Likewise, the Texas Constitution's Due Process
Clause provides that '[n]o citizen of this State shall be deprived of life,

Notice and the opportunity to be heard are the cornerstones of due process.
Before the State may deprive a person of property, the person must be
afforded notice and the opportunity to be heard.
Summary
The passage highlights the fundamental due process requirements under
both the U.S. Constitution and the Texas Constitution, emphasizing that
notice and the opportunity to be heard are essential before the state can
deprive a person of property. This directly supports the proposition that the
respondent's removal from his home without these procedural safeguards

However, the code mandates that any motion to vacate such an order must
be heard in a live, evidentiary hearing. The refusal to conduct such a

The Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects
against deprivation of life, liberty, or property by the state 'without due
process of law.' Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527, 537 (1981). The opportunity
to be heard is the fundamental requirement of due process; it is an
opportunity which must be granted at a meaningful time and in a
meaningful manner. Id. at 540; Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545, 552

Summary
The passage emphasizes the fundamental requirement of due process, which
is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful
manner. It highlights that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment requires the government to follow appropriate procedures
before depriving a person of life, liberty, or property. This directly supports
the proposition that the respondent's removal from his home without a

Summary
The Texas Family Code § 85.021 outlines the conditions under which a court
may issue a protective order that grants exclusive possession of a residence.
This implies that such an order must be rendered by the court, suggesting
that due process, including notice and an opportunity to be heard, should be
followed. If the respondent was removed from his home without such an
order being rendered, it could indicate a due process violation, as the
statutory requirements for issuing a protective order were not met.
Tex. Fam. Code § 83.006 Tex. Fam. Code § 83.006 Exclusion of Party From
Residence
Extract
Subject to the limitations of Section FAMILY CODE 85.021, a person may
only be excluded from the occupancy of the person's residence by a
temporary ex parte order under this chapter if the applicant: files a sworn
affidavit that provides a detailed description of the facts and circumstances
requiring the exclusion of the person from the residence; and appears in
person to testify at a temporary ex parte hearing to justify the issuance of
the order without notice. Before the court may render a temporary ex parte
order excluding a person from the person's residence, the court must find
from the required affidavit and testimony that: the applicant requesting the
excluding order either resides on the premises or has resided there within
30 days before the date the application was filed; the person to be excluded
has within the 30 days before the date the application was filed committed
family violence against a member of the household; and there is a clear and
present danger that the person to be excluded is likely to commit family
violence against a member of the household.
Summary
Specific requirements that must be met for a court to issue a temporary ex
parte order excluding a person from their residence. It requires a sworn
affidavit, personal testimony, and specific findings by the court regarding
recent family violence and the likelihood of future violence. This supports
the proposition by highlighting the due process requirements that must be
met before a person can be excluded from their home. If these requirements
were not met, it could indicate a due process violation.

Summary
Conditions under which a court in Texas may issue a temporary ex parte
order without notice or a hearing. Specifically, it allows for such an order if
there is a "clear and present danger of family violence." This suggests that,
in the absence of such a finding, issuing an order without notice or a hearing
could be problematic. The passage supports the proposition by highlighting
the requirement of a "clear and present danger" finding, which, if absent,
could indicate a due process violation.
Tex. Fam. Code § 262.102 Tex. Fam. Code § 262.102 Emergency Order
Authorizing Possession of Child
Extract
Before a court may, without prior notice and a hearing, issue a temporary
order for the conservatorship of a child under Section FAMILY CODE
105.001(a) or a temporary restraining order or attachment of a child
authorizing a governmental entity to take possession of a child in a suit
brought by a governmental entity, the court must find that: there is an
immediate danger to the physical health or safety of the child or the child
has been a victim of neglect or sexual abuse; continuation in the home
would be contrary to the child's welfare; there is no time, consistent with the
physical health or safety of the child and the nature of the emergency, for a
full adversary hearing under Subchapter C; the child would not be
adequately protected in the child's home with an order for the removal of
the alleged perpetrator under Section FAMILY CODE 262.1015 or FAMILY
CODE 262.1016 or a protective order issued under Title 4; placing the child
with a relative or designated caregiver or with a caregiver under a parental
child safety placement agreement authorized by Subchapter L, Chapter 264:
(A) was offered but refused; (B) was not possible because there was no time,
consistent with the physical health or safety of the child and the nature of
the emergency, to conduct the caregiver evaluation; or (C) would pose an
immediate danger to the physical health or safety of the child; and
reasonable efforts, consistent with the circumstances and providing for the
safety of the child, were made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal
of the child.
Summary
Specific conditions under which a court in Texas may issue a temporary
order for the conservatorship of a child without prior notice and a hearing. It
emphasizes the necessity of finding an immediate danger to the child's
physical health or safety, or evidence of neglect or abuse, and the lack of

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
time for a full adversary hearing. This aligns with the due process
requirements under the Fourteenth Amendment, which generally
necessitate notice and an opportunity to be heard before deprivation of
property or liberty. If these conditions are not met, the removal could be
considered a due process violation.
Tex. Fam. Code § 262.201 Tex. Fam. Code § 262.201 Full Adversary Hearing;
Findings of the Court
Extract
In a suit filed under Section FAMILY CODE 262.101 or FAMILY CODE
262.105, unless the child has already been returned to the parent, managing
conservator, possessory conservator, guardian, caretaker, or custodian
entitled to possession and the temporary order, if any, has been dissolved, a
full adversary hearing shall be held not later than the 14th day after the
date the child was taken into possession by the governmental entity... at the
conclusion of the full adversary hearing, the court shall order the return of
the child to the parent, managing conservator, possessory conservator,
guardian, caretaker, or custodian entitled to possession from whom the child
is removed unless the court finds sufficient evidence to satisfy a person of
ordinary prudence and caution that: there was a danger to the physical
health or safety of the child... the urgent need for protection required the
immediate removal of the child and reasonable efforts, consistent with the
circumstances and providing for the safety of the child, were made to
eliminate or prevent the child's removal; and reasonable efforts have been
made to enable the child to return home, but there is a substantial risk of a
continuing danger if the child is returned home.
Summary
Requirement for a full adversary hearing within 14 days of a child's removal
by a governmental entity, unless the child is returned or the temporary order
is dissolved. It emphasizes the necessity of findings and evidence to justify
the removal and continued separation of the child from their home. This
aligns with the due process requirement of notice and an opportunity to be
heard before deprivation, supporting the proposition that removal without
such procedures may constitute a due process violation.
Due Process
Gale Encyclopedia of Everyday Law - GALE - Jeffrey Wilson -
2006-01-01
Extract
Under both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution,
neither the federal government nor state governments may deprive any

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
person 'of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.' ... The due
process clause requires that every man shall have the protection of his day
in court, and the benefit of the general law, a law which hears before it
condemns, which proceeds not arbitrarily or capriciously, but upon inquiry,
and renders judgment only after trial, so that every citizen shall hold his life,
liberty, property and immunities under the protection of the general rules
which govern society. ... Procedural due process focuses primarily on a
person's right to be heard, rather than a person's right to prevail in a
dispute. ... Due process basically requires that a person who is deprived of a
recognized right must be given some sort of notice and an opportunity for a
hearing on the government's action.
Summary
Fundamental principles of due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth
Amendments, emphasizing the requirement for notice and an opportunity to
be heard before deprivation of life, liberty, or property. It highlights that due
process is concerned with fair procedures and that any deprivation must not
be arbitrary or capricious. This directly supports the proposition that
removing someone from their home without a hearing or evidence could
constitute a due process violation.
Due Process
Civil Procedure, 5th (Concepts and Insights Series) - Samuel
Issacharoff
Extract
The two most prominent are notice and a hearing: 'Parties whose rights are
to be affected are entitled to be heard; and in order that they may enjoy that
right they must first be notified.' According to the Supreme Court, these
requirements—the opportunity to be heard and its 'instrumental corollary, a
promise of prior notice'—'seem to be universally prescribed in all systems of
law established by civilized countries.' ... Under this analysis, the seizure of
a home produces a significant deprivation, unjustified by any governmental
exigency. Unlike the yacht in Calero-Toledo, which could presumably be
spirited away, 'real property cannot abscond,' meaning that 'the court’s
jurisdiction can be preserved without prior seizure.' The combination of the
lack of exigency, the importance of one’s homestead, and the necessarily
escalated risk of error in ex parte proceedings rendered the seizure
unconstitutional.
Summary
Due process requires notice and a hearing before deprivation of property.
The passage emphasizes the importance of these procedural safeguards and
highlights that the seizure of a home, without exigency, is a significant
deprivation that requires due process. The passage also notes that real

=== PAGE 17 ===

property cannot abscond, suggesting that there is no justification for
bypassing due process in such cases.
SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS AND THE ORIGINAL MEANING OF THE
FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT'S DUE PROCESS CLAUSE.
Faulkner Law Review - Thomas Goode Jones School of Law - Upham,
David R. - 2019-09-22
Extract
The very prohibition itself suggests a prior rightful state a rule that every
human person, by right, enjoys life, liberty, and property and should not be
deprived of the same except for some good cause... within the Due Process
Clause 'is necessarily implied and included the right to answer to and
contest the charge, and the consequent right to be discharged from it,
unless it is proved'... the clause does not merely prohibit offenses against
the law. It does not simply permit all deprivations unless forbidden by the
lawmaker. Rather, it more strictly prohibits all deprivations absent
something called 'process,' which process must be of a certain kind: 'of law.'
Summary
The passage emphasizes the fundamental principle that individuals have a
right to life, liberty, and property, and these rights cannot be deprived
without due process of law. It highlights the necessity of a legal or judicial
process before deprivation, which aligns with the proposition that the
respondent's removal from his home without due process could constitute a
violation. The passage supports the idea that due process requires an
opportunity to contest charges and that deprivation without such process is
prohibited.
The Unconstitutionality of Protective Orders Under the Texas Family Code –
Part I
Extract
The United States Constitution requires that every defendant receive a
meaningful trial. The 14th Amendment states that 'no state... shall deprive
any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.'...
Defendants are given no meaningful time to prepare for hearing. A
meaningful defense against an accusation of family violence requires an
opportunity to obtain rebuttal evidence and the application of a standard of
proof that accurately reflects the value of the rights that are at stake...
Shockingly, however, the minimum amount of required notice afforded to a
defendant in a protective order suit is only 48 hours’ notice prior to final
trial. Tex. Fam. Code § 84.004. These limitations do not allow for a
meaningful trial... Finally, defendants in protective order cases are not given

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
a meaningful opportunity to be heard. Without time to adequately prepare
for trial, a defendant absolutely cannot put forth a meaningful defense.
Summary
The Texas Family Code's provisions for protective orders may not provide
sufficient time for defendants to prepare a defense, which can result in a
lack of meaningful opportunity to be heard. This aligns with the proposition
that the respondent was deprived of property without due process, as the
lack of adequate notice and opportunity to prepare can lead to a due process
violation.
The Unconstitutionality of Protective Orders Under the Texas Family Code –
Part II
Extract
To enter a final civil protective order, the Court is required to find that the
defendant’s actions intended to result in physical harm, bodily injury,
assault, or sexual assault or were a threat that reasonably placed the family
member in fear of imminent physical harm, bodily injury, assault, or sexual
assault. These are criminal actions as defined by the Texas Penal Code and
conviction of which requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt. However, in a
civil protective order trial, the Court must only find that the defendant has
committed family violence and is likely to commit family violence in the
future by a preponderance of the evidence. Roper v. Jollife, 493 S.W.3d 624,
638 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2015, pet. denied). This simply does not make sense.
When a litigant is faced with loss of fundamental rights, due process
requires that fact findings be made by more than a preponderance of the
evidence. Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 423.
Summary
The passage highlights the due process concerns related to protective
orders under the Texas Family Code. It points out that while protective
orders can result in significant deprivations of liberty and property, the
standard of proof required is only a preponderance of the evidence, which is
lower than the "beyond a reasonable doubt" standard required for criminal
actions. This discrepancy raises due process concerns, especially when
fundamental rights are at stake. The passage supports the proposition by
emphasizing the need for proper findings and evidence before depriving
someone of their property or liberty, aligning with the due process
requirements under the Fourteenth Amendment.
