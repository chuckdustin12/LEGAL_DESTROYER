Question
If a judge in Texas deprived a litigant of their home and property without a
hearing, issued an order without findings, and temporarily terminated their
parental rights, is this action significant enough to invalidate the entire case
due to awarding relief before the burden of proof was met and depriving the
litigant of significant rights?
Answer (Texas)
Short response
Based on Texas law, a judge's actions that deprive a litigant of their home,
property, and temporary parental rights without a hearing and without
making required findings would likely constitute a significant due process
violation sufficient to invalidate the case upon appeal. Such actions would
fail to meet the "clear and convincing evidence" standard required for
termination of parental rights and violate the fundamental due process
requirements of notice and opportunity to be heard.
Summary
When a judge in Texas deprives a litigant of significant interests such as
their home, property, and parental rights without providing a hearing and
without issuing findings to support the order, this constitutes a serious
violation of procedural due process rights protected by both the United
States and Texas Constitutions. Texas law explicitly requires clear and
convincing evidence and specific procedural safeguards before parental
rights can be terminated, even temporarily, including notice, opportunity to
be heard, appointment of counsel for indigent parents, and specific findings
that support the court's decision. The failure to provide these procedural
protections represents a fundamental violation of due process.
The actions described would likely be sufficient grounds to invalidate the
entire case because they strike at core constitutional guarantees. Texas
courts have consistently held that procedural due process rights in parental
termination cases are of paramount importance due to the fundamental
nature of the rights at stake. When a judge awards relief before the burden
of proof is met through proper procedures, the entire proceeding is tainted
by the denial of basic constitutional protections. While certain due process
claims must be timely raised to be preserved for appeal, violations of this
magnitude involving fundamental rights would likely be considered harmful
error warranting reversal.

Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
Texas law provides strong procedural protections for parental rights and
property interests. The Texas Family Code contains specific provisions that
establish procedural requirements for cases involving the termination of
parental rights, even on a temporary basis.
Burden of Proof for Termination of Parental Rights
Texas Family Code § 161.001 establishes that termination of the parent-child
relationship requires clear and convincing evidence: "The court may order
termination of the parent-child relationship if the court finds by clear and
convincing evidence... that termination is in the best interest of the child." 
Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001. This high evidentiary standard underscores the
constitutional importance of parental rights.
Requirement for Hearings
Texas law mandates hearings at various stages of child protection
proceedings. When a child is taken into possession without a court order, 
Tex. Fam. Code § 262.105 requires that the person taking possession
"without unnecessary delay, shall: file a suit affecting the parent-child
relationship; request the court to appoint an attorney ad litem for the child;
and request an initial hearing to be held by no later than the first business
day after the date the child is taken into possession."
Furthermore, Tex. Fam. Code § 262.201 mandates that "a full adversary
hearing shall be held not later than the 14th day after the date the child was
taken into possession by the governmental entity" unless specific extensions
are granted. This requirement underscores the legislative recognition that
prompt hearings are essential to protecting parents' due process rights.
Right to Legal Representation
Tex. Fam. Code § 107.013 provides that in cases where termination of
parental rights is requested, "the court shall appoint an attorney ad litem to
represent the interests of: an indigent parent of the child who responds in
opposition to the termination or appointment." This provision ensures that
parents have legal representation to protect their fundamental rights.
Constitutional Framework
The due process requirements in parental rights cases stem from both
federal and state constitutional provisions. The Fourteenth Amendment of
the United States Constitution prohibits states from depriving individuals of
"life, liberty, or property, without due process of law." Similarly, Article I,
Section 19 of the Texas Constitution provides that no citizen shall be

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
"deprived of life, liberty, property, privileges or immunities, or in any manner
disfranchised, except by the due course of the law of the land."
Case Law
Texas courts have consistently emphasized the fundamental nature of
parental rights and the necessity of procedural due process in cases
involving these rights.
Due Process Requirements
In Campbell v. Stucki, 220 S.W.3d 562 (Tex. App. 2007), the court explained
the constitutional protections against deprivation of rights without due
process: "The Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution
protects against deprivation of life, liberty, or property by the State 'without
due process of law.' U.S. CONST. amend. XIV, § 1; Covarrubias v. Tex. Dep't
Criminal Justice-Inst. Div., 52 S.W.3d 318, 324 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi
2001, no pet.). The Texas Constitution states that no citizen of this state
shall be deprived of life, liberty, property, privileges or immunities, or in any
manner disfranchised, except by the 'due course of the law of the land.' TEX.
CONST. art. I, § 19."
The Texas Supreme Court, in Martinez v. Texas Department of Protective &
Regulatory Services, 116 S.W.3d 266 (Tex. 2003), affirmed that "at a
minimum, due process requires notice and an opportunity to be heard at a
meaningful time and in a meaningful manner." The court further recognized
that "parents have a constitutionally recognized liberty interest in the care,
custody, and control of—and right of association with—their children" and
thus are "entitled to procedural due process in connection with the
termination proceeding."
Clear and Convincing Evidence Standard
Texas courts have consistently held that the termination of parental rights
requires a heightened burden of proof. In In re L.M.I., 119 S.W.3d 707 (Tex.
2003), the Texas Supreme Court emphasized that "the clear and convincing
evidence requirement necessarily means that the burden of proof that an
affidavit of relinquishment was voluntarily executed cannot be shifted to a
parent. There must be clear and convincing evidence, from the record as a
whole, that the affidavit was knowingly and voluntarily executed."
This standard was established by the Texas Supreme Court in In Interest of
G.M., 596 S.W.2d 846 (Tex. 1980), which held: "The right to enjoy a natural
family unit is no less important than the right to liberty which requires at
least a clear and convincing standard of proof to inhibit such liberty through
involuntary and indefinite confinement in a mental institution. Termination is
a drastic remedy and is of such weight and gravity that due process requires
the state to justify termination of the parent-child relationship by proof more
substantial than a preponderance of the evidence."

Framework for Evaluating Due Process Claims
Texas courts employ a specific framework for analyzing due process claims.
As explained in In re A.J., 559 S.W.3d 713 (Tex. App. 2018): "In analyzing a
claim of deprivation of procedural due process, we apply a two-part test: (1)
whether the complaining party has a liberty or property interest entitled to
protection; and (2) if so, what process is due."
To determine what process is due, courts apply the balancing test from
Mathews v. Eldridge, as referenced in In re Interest of J.R., 652 S.W.3d 508
(Tex. App. 2022): "In a due process analysis, the Supreme Court of Texas
invoked the balancing test laid out in Mathews v. Eldridge, ... Mathews
directs courts to balance three factors in determining what procedural
safeguards are required by the federal due process clause: (1) the private
interest affected by the official action; (2) the risk of erroneous deprivation
of such interest through the procedures used and the probable value, if any,
of additional or alternative procedural safeguards; and (3) the government's
interests, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative
costs that the additional or substitute procedural requirements would
entail."
Consequences of Procedural Errors
Texas courts have addressed the consequences of procedural errors in cases
involving termination of parental rights. In In Interest of S.R.M., 601 S.W.2d
766 (Tex. Ct. App. 1980), the court held that a judgment should be reversed
because the trial court terminated parental rights upon unpled grounds and
without sufficient evidence: "The appellant maintains that the judgment
should be reversed because the trial court terminated her parental rights to
the child upon unpled grounds... We agree that the judgment should be
reversed because the trial court terminated the appellant's parental rights
to the child upon unpled grounds."
Analysis
Parental Rights as Constitutionally Protected Interests
Parental rights are recognized as constitutionally protected interests that
trigger due process protections. In In re Interest of J.R., 652 S.W.3d 508
(Tex. App. 2022), the court affirmed that "procedural due process rules are
meant to protect persons from the mistaken or unjustified deprivation of life,
liberty, or property." The court in In re J.H., 13-21-00175-CV (Tex. App. Nov
04, 2021) emphasized that "termination proceedings should be strictly
scrutinized, and involuntary termination statutes are strictly construed in
favor of the parent."
When a judge temporarily terminates parental rights without a hearing and
without findings, this directly infringes upon this constitutionally protected
interest. As noted in In re A.J., 559 S.W.3d 713 (Tex. App. 2018), "at a
minimum, due process requires notice and an opportunity to be heard at a

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
meaningful time and in a meaningful manner." The failure to provide a
hearing deprives the parent of this fundamental opportunity.
Property Rights as Constitutionally Protected Interests
Similarly, the deprivation of a litigant's home and property without a hearing
implicates constitutionally protected property interests. In Thoyakulathu v.
Brennan, 192 S.W.3d 849 (Tex. App. 2006), the court recognized that "a
cause of action is a species of property protected by the Fourteenth
Amendment's Due Process Clause" and that "due process requires that state
procedures must provide proper procedural safeguards before a claimant's
property interest is destroyed."
The court further stated that "a restriction on litigants' use of established
adjudicatory procedures denies due process when such restriction is 'the
equivalent of denying them an opportunity to be heard upon their claimed
right[s].'" When a judge deprives a litigant of their home and property
without a hearing, this constitutes a denial of the opportunity to be heard on
their claimed property rights.
Failure to Meet the "Clear and Convincing Evidence"
Standard
Texas law requires that the termination of parental rights be supported by
"clear and convincing evidence." This standard is mandated by both statute
(Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001) and case law (In re L.M.I., 119 S.W.3d 707 (Tex.
2003)). As emphasized in W.L. v. Tex. Dep't of Family & Protective Servs.,
NO. 03-19-00827-CV (Tex. App. Mar 12, 2020), this standard is "that
measure or degree of proof which will produce in the mind of the trier of
fact a firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegations sought to be
established."
When a judge issues an order without findings and without a hearing, it is
impossible to determine whether this standard has been met. The absence of
findings means there is no demonstration that the judge considered the
relevant factors and applied the appropriate legal standard. The absence of
a hearing means that the litigant had no opportunity to present evidence or
challenge the evidence against them, which is essential to the fact-finding
process.
Application of the Mathews Balancing Test
Applying the Mathews balancing test referenced in In re Interest of J.R., 652
S.W.3d 508 (Tex. App. 2022) supports the conclusion that the judge's actions
constituted a violation of due process:
Private Interest: The private interests at stake—parental rights and
property rights—are of fundamental importance. As recognized in In re
K.B., 683 S.W.3d 850 (Tex. App. 2024), "observing that termination
cases implicate fundamental liberties, Texas courts begin with the
1. 

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
premise that our proceedings to terminate parental rights must comply
with the requirements of procedural due process."
Risk of Erroneous Deprivation: The risk of erroneous deprivation is
extremely high when decisions are made without a hearing and without
findings. The absence of these procedural safeguards means that the
judge's decision-making process is opaque and potentially arbitrary.
Government Interest: While the government has an interest in
protecting children and efficient judicial administration, these interests
do not justify dispensing with fundamental procedural safeguards. As
noted in In re L.M.I., 119 S.W.3d 707 (Tex. 2003), "before a State may
sever completely and irrevocably the rights of parents in their natural
child, due process requires that the State support its allegations by at
least clear and convincing evidence."
Time Limitations for Challenging Orders
It is important to note that Tex. Fam. Code § 161.211 places limitations on
challenges to termination orders: "Notwithstanding Rule 329, Texas Rules of
Civil Procedure, the validity of an order terminating the parental rights of a
person who has been personally served... is not subject to collateral or direct
attack after the sixth month after the date the order was signed." This
suggests that challenges to the judge's actions should be raised promptly to
ensure they are not barred by this limitation.
Preservation of Due Process Claims
Texas courts have held that due process claims must generally be preserved
by raising them in the trial court. In In re J.H., 13-21-00175-CV (Tex. App.
Nov 04, 2021), the court noted that "even constitutional complaints can be
waived absent a timely objection" and that "complaints about due process
violations must be raised and ruled on in the trial court in order to be
preserved for appeal."
However, the severity of the due process violations described—deprivation
of home, property, and parental rights without a hearing or findings—may be
considered fundamental error that can be raised for the first time on appeal.
The complete failure to provide basic procedural safeguards for such
fundamental rights strikes at the heart of the judicial process itself.
Exceptions and Caveats
Temporary vs. Permanent Orders
The question refers to "temporarily terminated" parental rights, which
suggests the order may have been intended as a temporary rather than
permanent measure. While temporary orders may involve somewhat
different procedures than permanent termination orders, they still require
due process. As noted in Tex. Fam. Code § 109.001, even temporary orders
during the pendency of an appeal require "notice and hearing."

Emergency Situations
Texas law does provide for emergency removal of children in certain
situations. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.101 allows for taking possession of a child
without prior notice and hearing, but only if supported by an affidavit
showing "an immediate danger to the physical health or safety of the child"
and that "there is no time, consistent with the physical health or safety of
the child, for a full adversary hearing." Even in these emergency situations, 
Tex. Fam. Code § 262.105 requires that an initial hearing be held "no later
than the first business day after the date the child is taken into possession."
If the judge's actions were taken in response to an emergency situation,
there might be some justification for expedited proceedings. However, this
would not justify the complete absence of a hearing or findings, especially
when property rights are also affected.
Standing to Raise Due Process Claims
To successfully challenge the judge's actions, the litigant must have standing
to raise due process claims. This generally requires that they have a
recognized liberty or property interest at stake, which would clearly be the
case for a parent whose parental rights and property are at issue.
Conclusion
Based on the legislative framework, constitutional principles, and case law
of Texas, a judge's actions that deprive a litigant of their home, property, and
parental rights without a hearing and without findings would likely
constitute a significant due process violation sufficient to invalidate the case.
This conclusion is supported by several key principles:
Fundamental Nature of the Rights at Stake: Both parental rights and
property rights are constitutionally protected interests that trigger due
process protections. Texas courts have consistently recognized the
fundamental nature of these rights and the necessity of procedural
safeguards to protect them.
Clear and Convincing Evidence Standard: Texas law requires that the
termination of parental rights be supported by clear and convincing
evidence. Without a hearing and findings, it is impossible to determine
whether this standard has been met.
Procedural Requirements: Texas law mandates specific procedures for
cases involving the termination of parental rights, including hearings,
appointment of counsel for indigent parents, and specific findings. The
failure to provide these procedures constitutes a violation of both
statutory requirements and constitutional due process guarantees.
Balancing of Interests: Applying the Mathews balancing test, the
private interests at stake are of fundamental importance, the risk of
erroneous deprivation is high when decisions are made without proper
1.

3.

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
procedures, and the government's interests do not justify dispensing
with basic procedural safeguards.
When a judge deprives a litigant of their home, property, and parental rights
without a hearing and without findings, they undermine the very foundation
of due process: the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a
meaningful manner. Such actions represent a fundamental breakdown of the
judicial process and would likely be considered sufficient grounds to
invalidate the entire case upon appeal or other appropriate legal challenge.
It is important to note that any challenge to the judge's actions should be
raised promptly to ensure it is not barred by statutory limitations. However,
given the gravity of the due process violations described, there is a strong
argument that they constitute fundamental error that can be raised even if
not preserved in the trial court.
In summary, when a judge awards relief before the burden of proof has been
met and deprives a litigant of significant rights without basic procedural
protections, this action is significant enough to invalidate the entire case
under Texas law.

G. M., In Interest of, 596 S.W.2d 846 (Tex. 1980)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The right to enjoy a natural family unit is no less important than the right to
liberty which requires at least a clear and convincing standard of proof to
inhibit such liberty through involuntary and indefinite confinement in a
mental institution. Termination is a drastic remedy and is of such weight and
gravity that due process requires the state to justify termination of the
parent-child relationship by proof more substantial than a preponderance of
the evidence. Hereafter, the 'clear and convincing evidence' standard of
proof will be required in all proceedings for involuntary termination of the
parent-child relationship.
Summary
The Texas Supreme Court requires a "clear and convincing evidence"
standard of proof for involuntary termination of the parent-child
relationship. This is a higher standard than the "preponderance of the
evidence" standard typically used in civil cases. The passage emphasizes the
importance of due process and the need for substantial justification before
terminating parental rights. This suggests that if a judge issued an order
terminating parental rights without meeting this standard, it could be
significant enough to invalidate the case.

In re L.M.I., 119 S.W.3d 707 (Tex. 2003)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Justice Owen, applying a different approach, cites the requirement under
the Constitution and the Texas Family Code that the ultimate burden of
proof, based on clear and convincing evidence, remains with the party
seeking to terminate the parental rights... The clear and convincing
evidence requirement necessarily means that the burden of proof that an
affidavit of relinquishment was voluntarily executed cannot be shifted to a
parent. There must be clear and convincing evidence, from the record as a
whole, that the affidavit was knowingly and voluntarily executed... Today we
hold that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment demands
more than this. Before a State may sever completely and irrevocably the
rights of parents in their natural child, due process requires that the State
support its allegations by at least clear and convincing evidence.
Summary
The passage from "In re L.M.I." highlights the constitutional and statutory
requirements that the burden of proof in parental rights termination cases
must be met with clear and convincing evidence. It emphasizes that due
process requires the state to support its allegations with this level of
evidence before terminating parental rights. This is relevant to the question
as it underscores the necessity of meeting the burden of proof and the
potential invalidation of actions taken without such evidence.

Texas Supreme Court
Extract
The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment encompasses three
types of protection: ... The procedural component guarantees fair
procedure. ... Questions of procedural due process require an analysis of
whether the plaintiff has a constitutionally protected property or liberty
interest at stake, and if so, what process is due to sufficiently protect that
interest. ... At a minimum, due process requires notice and an opportunity to
be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. ... Parents have
a constitutionally recognized liberty interest in the care, custody, and control
of—and right of association with—their children. ... Consequently, Martinez
is entitled to procedural due process in connection with the termination
proceeding.
Summary
Procedural due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment,
emphasizing the necessity of notice and an opportunity to be heard when a
constitutionally protected property or liberty interest is at stake. In the
context of parental rights, the passage highlights that parents have a
recognized liberty interest in the care and custody of their children, which
entitles them to procedural due process in termination proceedings. This
suggests that any deprivation of such rights without due process could be
significant enough to challenge the validity of the proceedings.

convincing evidence.' Tex. Fam. Code § 161.206(a); see In re J.F.C., 96 S.W.
3d 256, 263 (Tex. 2002) ('Due process requires the application of the clear
and convincing standard of proof in parental termination cases.'). The clear
and convincing burden of proof is 'that measure or degree of proof which
will produce in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief or conviction as to
the truth of the allegations sought to be established.'
Summary
The termination of parental rights in Texas requires a specific legal process.
This process includes proving one of the predicate grounds under section
161.001(b)(1) of the Texas Family Code and demonstrating that termination
is in the child's best interest. The standard of proof required is "clear and
convincing evidence," which is a higher standard than a preponderance of
the evidence. This standard is necessary to satisfy due process requirements
in parental termination cases. The passage emphasizes the importance of
meeting this burden of proof to ensure that due process rights are not
violated.

In re Interest of C.B., 659 S.W.3d 504 (Tex. App. 2023)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
To determine whether the trial court violated C.S.B.’s due process rights by
denying his motion for continuance and proceeding to a termination trial
without a showing of competence to stand criminal trial, we consider the
Mathews factors. See R.M.T., 352 S.W.3d at 20. Concerning the private
interests affected by the court's decision, both the parent's and child's
interests must be considered. See In re M.S., 115 S.W.3d 534, 547 (Tex.
2003). A parent's right to maintain custody and raise his child is an interest
far more precious than any property right. Id. Thus, C.S.B.’s interest weighs
heavily in favor of strong procedural protections. See R.M.T., 352 S.W.3d at
20.
Summary
Importance of due process rights in the context of terminating parental
rights, emphasizing that a parent's right to custody is a significant interest
that requires strong procedural protections. This suggests that any action
that deprives a parent of their rights without proper procedure could be
significant enough to challenge the validity of the case. The passage also
references the Mathews factors, which are used to evaluate due process
claims, indicating that procedural fairness is crucial in such cases.

In re Interest of G.X.H., 584 S.W.3d 543 (Tex. App. 2019)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
The U.S. Constitution prohibits a state from 'depriv[ing] any person of life,
liberty, or property, without due process of law....' U.S. Const. amend. XIV, §
1. The Texas Constitution states, 'No citizen of this State shall be deprived of
life, liberty, property, privileges or immunities, or in any manner
disfranchised, except by the due course of the law of the land.' Tex. Const.
art. I, § 19. Because the Department has not suggested otherwise, we
presume the due course of law analysis under the Texas Constitution mirrors
the due process analysis under the U.S. Constitution. Reynoso v. Dibs US,
Inc., 541 S.W.3d 331, 338 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2017, no pet.). A
violation of substantive due process occurs when the government deprives
individuals of constitutionally protected rights by an arbitrary use of power.
Id. Procedural due process rules are meant to protect persons not from the
deprivation, but from the mistaken or unjustified deprivation of life, liberty,
or property. Id. at 339 (citing Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247, 260, 98 S.Ct.

Summary
The passage highlights the constitutional requirement for due process,
which includes notice and an opportunity to be heard. This is directly
relevant to the question of whether a judge's actions in depriving a litigant
of property and parental rights without a hearing could invalidate a case.
The passage suggests that such actions could indeed violate due process
rights, potentially invalidating the case.

grounds... The appellant further contends that the judgment should be
reversed because the evidence is legally insufficient to support the trial
court's challenged findings upon the unpled grounds for termination. Our
Texas Supreme Court has determined that in involuntary parent-child
termination proceedings, the essential facts must be proved by 'the clear
and convincing evidence standard.'
Summary
A judgment can be reversed if parental rights are terminated on unpled
grounds or if the evidence is legally insufficient to support the findings. The
Texas Supreme Court requires that essential facts in such proceedings be
proved by a "clear and convincing evidence standard." This suggests that if
a judge issues an order without proper findings or without meeting the
burden of proof, it could be significant enough to invalidate the case.
In re E.L.T., 93 S.W.3d 372 (Tex. App. 2002)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Although I concur in the result the majority reaches, I write separately
regarding the failure of Texas law to adequately address parental
competency in the context of termination of parental rights. As the majority
correctly states, no existing statute or rule requires a trial court in a
termination proceeding to hold a hearing to determine a parent's
competency. Thus, under certain limited circumstances, there can be no
guarantee that a party is effectively able to provide counsel with necessary
or relevant data to prevent a wrongful deprivation of parental rights... No
Texas case specifically addresses a due process right to a parental
competency hearing prior to a proceeding to terminate parental rights... In
criminal cases, 'the due process right to a fair trial prevents the government
from subjecting a person to trial whose mental condition is such that he
lacks the capacity to understand the nature and object of the proceedings
against him, to consult with counsel, and to assist in preparing his defense.'
Alcott v. State, 51 S.W.3d 596, 598 (Tex.Crim.App.2001). The same due
process protection should be provided to a parent facing the involuntary
deprivation of the fundamental right to direct a child's upbringing.
Summary
The passage highlights a significant gap in Texas law regarding the
requirement for a hearing to determine parental competency in termination
proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of due process rights,
particularly in cases where parental rights are at stake, drawing parallels to
criminal cases where competency is a critical factor. The passage suggests
that the lack of procedural safeguards, such as a competency hearing, could
lead to wrongful deprivation of parental rights, which is a significant due
process concern.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
To terminate parental rights, the Department has the burden to prove one of
the predicate grounds in section 161.001(b)(1) of the Texas Family Code and
that termination is in the best interest of the child. See Tex. Fam. Code §
161.001(b)(1), (2); In re A.V., 113 S.W.3d 355, 362 (Tex. 2003). The
applicable standard of proof is the clear and convincing standard. Tex. Fam.
Code § 161.206(a); see In re J.F.C., 96 S.W.3d 256, 263 (Tex. 2002)

in parental termination cases). The clear and convincing standard is 'that
measure or degree of proof which will produce in the mind of the trier of
fact a firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegations sought to be
established.'
Summary
Burden of proof required for the termination of parental rights in Texas,
which is the "clear and convincing" standard. This standard is necessary to
ensure due process and fundamental fairness in such proceedings. If a judge
issued an order without meeting this burden of proof, it could be a
significant procedural error.
In re K.B., 683 S.W.3d 850 (Tex. App. 2024)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Observing that termination cases implicate fundamental liberties, Texas
courts begin with the premise that our proceedings to terminate parental
rights must comply with the requirements of procedural due process. In re
B.L.D., 113 S.W.3d 340, 351-52 (Tex. 2003). The phrase ‘due process,’
although incapable of precise definition, expresses the requirement of
fundamental fairness... It is already established that in proceedings to
terminate parental rights, in Texas, indigent parents are entitled to
appointed counsel, see Tex. Fam. Code § 107.013(a)(1), and that as a matter
of due process, the statutory right to appointed counsel embodies the right
to effective counsel... Additionally, due process demands that indigent
parents be provided with a transcript of proceedings in which their parental
rights were terminated.

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
Texas courts emphasize the importance of procedural due process in cases
involving the termination of parental rights. This includes the right to
effective counsel and access to transcripts of proceedings. The deprivation
of significant rights without due process, such as a hearing or findings,
could potentially invalidate a case if it is determined that procedural due
process was not followed.
In re A. J., 559 S.W.3d 713 (Tex. App. 2018)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
In this case, J.B.J., Jr. was never statutorily admonished of his right to
counsel or timely appointed counsel before trial. The commencement of trial
on October 12, 2017, was a critical stage of the termination proceedings, at
which the indigent father was not represented by counsel. Thus, J.B.J., Jr.
contends that he was denied procedural due process by the trial court’s
failure to advise him of his right to counsel prior to the beginning of his trial.
In analyzing a claim of deprivation of procedural due process, we apply a
two-part test: (1) whether the complaining party has a liberty or property
interest entitled to protection; and (2) if so, what process is due. ... At a
minimum, due process requires notice and an opportunity to be heard at a
meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S.
319, 333, 96 S.Ct. 893, 902, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976). What process is due in
any given situation is measured by a flexible standard that depends on the
practical requirements of the circumstances.
Summary
Procedural due process is a critical component in cases involving the
termination of parental rights. The passage highlights the necessity of
advising a parent of their right to counsel and ensuring they have
representation, especially at critical stages of the proceedings. The failure to
provide such due process, including notice and an opportunity to be heard,
can be grounds for challenging the validity of the proceedings. The passage
also outlines a two-part test to determine if due process was violated,
focusing on whether there is a protected liberty or property interest and
what process is due.

Appellant also argues that this statutory scheme violates her due process

protection, and if she does, what process is due... Therefore, we hold that
Appellant's right to retain custody of her children is a constitutionally
protected liberty interest and must be afforded procedural due process.

When a conflict arises between the individual's protected interest under the
fourteenth amendment and the countervailing compelling state interest, the
individual is protected by the due process guarantee of the amendment. But
in a case, such as this one, in which due process unquestionably applies, the
question remains what process is due. Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471,
481, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 2600, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972). Due process is flexible and

U.S. 545, 552, 85 S.Ct. 1187, 1191, 14 L.Ed.2d 62 (1965).
Summary
Due process under the Fourteenth Amendment requires that individuals be
given the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful
manner. This principle is generally applicable to cases where significant
rights, such as parental rights, are at stake. The passage emphasizes the
flexibility of due process and the necessity for procedural protections
tailored to the specific situation.

Tex. Fam. Code § 107.013 Tex. Fam. Code § 107.013 Mandatory Appointment
of Attorney Ad Litem For Parent
Extract
In a suit filed by a governmental entity under Subtitle E in which
termination of the parent-child relationship or the appointment of a
conservator for a child is requested, the court shall appoint an attorney ad
litem to represent the interests of: an indigent parent of the child who
responds in opposition to the termination or appointment; ... if a parent is
not represented by an attorney at the parent's first appearance in court, the
court shall inform the parent of: the right to be represented by an attorney;
and if the parent is indigent and appears in opposition to the suit, the right
to an attorney ad litem appointed by the court.
Summary
In cases where a governmental entity seeks to terminate parental rights or
appoint a conservator, the court is required to appoint an attorney ad litem
for indigent parents who oppose the action. This ensures that the parent's
rights are protected and that they have legal representation. The failure to
appoint an attorney ad litem or inform the parent of their rights could be
significant in evaluating whether the parent's rights were adequately
protected in the legal process.

Summary
In cases affecting the parent-child relationship, the court has the authority
to issue temporary orders to protect the child's safety and welfare during an
appeal. These orders can be made on the court's own motion or on the
motion of any party, but they require notice and a hearing. The passage also
notes that temporary orders under this section are not subject to
interlocutory appeal, meaning they cannot be appealed before the final
judgment in the case. This suggests that the court's actions in issuing
temporary orders are intended to be protective and are not easily
overturned before the case is fully resolved.
Tex. Fam. Code § 161.211 Tex. Fam. Code § 161.211 Direct Or Collateral
Attack On Termination Order
Extract
(a) Notwithstanding Rule 329, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, the validity of
an order terminating the parental rights of a person who has been
personally served or who has executed an affidavit of relinquishment of
parental rights or an affidavit of waiver of interest in a child or whose rights
have been terminated under Section FAMILY CODE 161.002(b) is not
subject to collateral or direct attack after the sixth month after the date the
order was signed. (b) Notwithstanding Rule 329, Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure, the validity of an order terminating the parental rights of a
person who is served by citation by publication is not subject to collateral or
direct attack after the sixth month after the date the order was signed. (c) A
direct or collateral attack on an order terminating parental rights based on
an unrevoked affidavit of relinquishment of parental rights or affidavit of
waiver of interest in a child is limited to issues relating to fraud, duress, or
coercion in the execution of the affidavit.
Summary
Limitations on attacking the validity of an order terminating parental rights
in Texas. Specifically, it states that such orders are not subject to collateral
or direct attack after six months from the date the order was signed, except
in cases involving fraud, duress, or coercion related to affidavits of
relinquishment or waiver of interest. This suggests that if the order in
question was signed more than six months ago, it may not be possible to
invalidate the entire case based on the issues described, unless there is
evidence of fraud, duress, or coercion.

Tex. Fam. Code § 262.201 Tex. Fam. Code § 262.201 Full Adversary Hearing;
Findings of the Court
Extract
In a suit filed under Section FAMILY CODE 262.101 or FAMILY CODE
262.105, unless the child has already been returned to the parent, managing
conservator, possessory conservator, guardian, caretaker, or custodian
entitled to possession and the temporary order, if any, has been dissolved, a
full adversary hearing shall be held not later than the 14th day after the
date the child was taken into possession by the governmental entity, unless
the court grants an extension under Subsection (e) or (e-1).
Summary
Texas law requires a full adversary hearing to be held within 14 days after a
child is taken into possession by a governmental entity, unless an extension
is granted. This hearing is crucial to determine whether the child should be
returned to the parent or if there is sufficient evidence to justify the child's
continued removal. The requirement for a hearing and the necessity of
findings suggest that depriving a litigant of their home, property, and
parental rights without such a hearing and findings could be significant
enough to challenge the validity of the case.
Tex. Fam. Code § 262.101 Tex. Fam. Code § 262.101 Filing Petition Before
Taking Possession of Child
Extract
An original suit filed by a governmental entity that requests permission to
take possession of a child without prior notice and a hearing must be
supported by an affidavit sworn to by a person with personal knowledge and
stating facts sufficient to satisfy a person of ordinary prudence and caution
that: there is an immediate danger to the physical health or safety of the
child or the child has been a victim of neglect or sexual abuse; continuation
in the home would be contrary to the child's welfare; there is no time,
consistent with the physical health or safety of the child, for a full adversary
hearing under Subchapter C; the child would not be adequately protected in
the child's home with an order for the removal of the alleged perpetrator
under Section FAMILY CODE 262.1015 or FAMILY CODE 262.1016 or a
protective order issued under Title 4; placing the child with a relative or
designated caregiver or with a caregiver under a parental child safety
placement agreement authorized by Subchapter L, Chapter 264: (A) was
offered but refused; (B) was not possible because there was no time,
consistent with the physical health or safety of the child and the nature of
the emergency, to conduct the caregiver evaluation; or (C) would pose an
immediate danger to the physical health or safety of the child; and
reasonable efforts, consistent with the circumstances and providing for the

=== PAGE 23 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
safety of the child, were made to prevent or eliminate the need for the
removal of the child.
Summary
The Texas Family Code § 262.101 outlines the requirements for a
governmental entity to take possession of a child without prior notice and a
hearing. It mandates that such actions must be supported by an affidavit
detailing immediate danger to the child and the lack of time for a full
adversary hearing. This suggests that any deprivation of parental rights
without meeting these criteria could be challenged as improper.
Tex. Fam. Code § 262.105 Tex. Fam. Code § 262.105 Filing Petition After
Taking Possession of Child In Emergency
Extract
When a child is taken into possession without a court order, the person
taking the child into possession, without unnecessary delay, shall: file a suit
affecting the parent-child relationship; request the court to appoint an
attorney ad litem for the child; and request an initial hearing to be held by
no later than the first business day after the date the child is taken into
possession.
Summary
Procedural requirements when a child is taken into possession without a
court order. It mandates that a suit affecting the parent-child relationship
must be filed, an attorney ad litem must be appointed for the child, and an
initial hearing must be requested promptly. This suggests that due process is
required even in emergency situations, and the lack of a hearing or findings
could be significant procedural errors. The statute emphasizes the necessity
of a hearing, which implies that bypassing this step could potentially
invalidate actions taken without meeting the burden of proof.

Summary
The termination of the parent-child relationship in Texas requires a court to
find clear and convincing evidence that termination is in the best interest of
the child. This implies that a hearing and specific findings are necessary to
meet the burden of proof. If a judge issued an order without findings and
deprived a litigant of significant rights without a hearing, it could be argued
that the procedural requirements were not met, potentially invalidating the
case.
DIALOGIC DUE PROCESS.
University of Pennsylvania Law Review - University of Pennsylvania,
Law School - Parkin, Jason - 2019-04-01
Extract
For over forty years, since its decision in Mathews v. Eldridge, the Supreme
Court has evaluated the constitutionality of procedural rules based on a fact-
intensive cost--benefit analysis. (16) Under Mathews, courts must consider
three factors when determining the 'specific dictates' of procedural due
process: [f]irst, the private interest that will be affected by the official
action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through
the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or
substitute procedural safeguards; and finally the Government's interest,
including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens
that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail. (17)
Summary
The Supreme Court's decision in Mathews v. Eldridge provides a framework
for evaluating procedural due process claims. This framework requires
consideration of the private interest affected, the risk of erroneous
deprivation, and the government's interest. This is relevant to the question
as it provides a basis for assessing whether the judge's actions in the Texas
case could be considered a violation of due process.

SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS AND THE ORIGINAL MEANING OF THE
FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT'S DUE PROCESS CLAUSE.
Faulkner Law Review - Thomas Goode Jones School of Law - Upham,
David R. - 2019-09-22
Extract
The very prohibition itself suggests a prior rightful state a rule that every
human person, by right, enjoys life, liberty, and property and should not be
deprived of the same except for some good cause... As Justice Curtis said a
decade before the Fourteenth Amendment, within the Due Process Clause 'is
necessarily implied and included the right to answer to and contest the
charge, and the consequent right to be discharged from it, unless it is
proved'... due process of law means 'legal proceedings according to the
rules and forms which have been established for the protection of private
rights.'
Summary
The passage highlights the fundamental principle that individuals should not
be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process, which includes
the right to a hearing and the opportunity to contest charges. This principle
is crucial in evaluating whether a judge's actions in depriving a litigant of
property and parental rights without a hearing and findings are significant
enough to invalidate a case.

Extract
The Due Process Clause forbids government actors, including public-school
officials, (1) from interfering with an individual's 'life, liberty, or property,
without due process of law.' (2) The Clause protects some of the interests
most vital to American democracy. The Supreme Court has understood the
principal value of the Clause as promoting accurate decision making, (3)
thus restraining arbitrary government action. (4) Procedural protections -
often in the form of notice and opportunity to be heard before a government
decision maker--function, in addition to facilitating accuracy of the
substantive decision, (5) to promote participatory and dignitary values (6)
and advance fundamental fairness. (7)
Summary
The Due Process Clause is a fundamental constitutional protection that
requires government actors, including judges, to provide notice and an
opportunity to be heard before depriving an individual of life, liberty, or
property. This principle is designed to prevent arbitrary government action
and ensure fairness in decision-making. The passage highlights the
importance of procedural protections in promoting accurate and fair
outcomes.
