Question
Defendants Myers and Branthoover exchanged numerous interstate text
messages and emails, and submitted electronic court filings containing false
statements and misrepresentations regarding marital status, property
ownership, and protective orders. 18 U.S.C. § 1343 (Wire Fraud) is satisfied
when a person, having devised a scheme to defraud, transmits or causes to
be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in
interstate commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or sounds for the
purpose of executing such scheme. The use of interstate electronic
communications to submit and coordinate fraudulent legal documents and
financial transactions constitutes wire fraud, which is a predicate act under
RICO.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
The use of interstate text messages, emails, and electronic court filings
containing false statements by Defendants Myers and Branthoover
constitutes wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, which qualifies as a predicate
act under RICO. The interstate electronic communications used to submit
and coordinate fraudulent legal documents regarding marital status,
property ownership, and protective orders satisfy the elements of wire
fraud: a scheme to defraud, the use of interstate wire communications, and
the intent to execute such scheme.
Summary
The actions of Defendants Myers and Branthoover fall squarely within the
elements required to establish wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343. By
exchanging interstate text messages and emails, and submitting electronic
court filings containing false statements about marital status, property
ownership, and protective orders, the defendants used interstate wire
communications to execute a scheme to defraud. The statutory language of 
18 U.S.C. § 1343 explicitly prohibits the transmission of "writings, signs,
signals, pictures, or sounds" through interstate wire communications for the
purpose of executing a fraudulent scheme, which is precisely what occurred
in this case.
Moreover, these actions constitute a predicate act under the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). As defined in 18 U.S.C. §
1961, "racketeering activity" includes "any act which is indictable under...
section 1343 (relating to wire fraud)." Therefore, the defendants' use of
interstate electronic communications to submit and coordinate fraudulent
legal documents and financial transactions satisfies the requirements for a
predicate act under RICO. This conclusion is supported by extensive case
law and secondary legal materials that have consistently affirmed the broad

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
applicability of the wire fraud statute to various forms of electronic
communications used to perpetrate fraudulent schemes.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislation
The legal framework for wire fraud is established by 18 U.S.C. § 1343, which
states:
"Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to
defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent
pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be
transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in
interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or
sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined
under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both." 18 U.S.C. §
1343 (2025)
This statute clearly criminalizes the use of interstate wire communications
to further a fraudulent scheme, which directly applies to the defendants' use
of text messages, emails, and electronic court filings to make false
statements and misrepresentations.
Additionally, 18 U.S.C. § 1961 establishes wire fraud as a predicate act for
RICO purposes:
"As used in this chapter- 'racketeering activity' means... (B) any act which is
indictable under any of the following provisions of title 18, United States
Code:... section 1343 (relating to wire fraud)..." 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (2025)
This explicit inclusion of wire fraud in the definition of "racketeering
activity" demonstrates that acts of wire fraud can serve as predicate acts for
RICO violations.
Case Law
The elements of wire fraud have been consistently defined in case law. In 
United States v. Bey (U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Wisconsin,
2024), the court stated that "The elements of wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. §
1343 directly parallel those of the mail fraud statute, but require the use of
an interstate telephone call or electronic communication made in
furtherance of the scheme..." This clarifies that electronic communications,
such as the text messages and emails exchanged by Defendants Myers and
Branthoover, fall within the scope of wire fraud when used to further a
fraudulent scheme.
Similarly, in United States v. Dobson, Case No. 1:12-CR-42 (E.D. Tenn. Aug
08, 2013), the court explained that a wire-fraud conviction under 18 U.S.C. §
1343 requires proof that "the defendant devised or willfully participated in a
scheme to defraud[,]... used or caused to be used an interstate wire
communication in furtherance of the scheme[,]... and... intended to deprive a

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
victim of money or property." This highlights the essential elements that
must be proven to establish wire fraud.
In United States v. Kieffer, 681 F.3d 1143 (10th Cir. 2012), the court
reiterated the statutory language, emphasizing that wire fraud applies to
"any writings, signs, signals, [or] pictures" transmitted via interstate wire
communications for the purpose of executing a fraudulent scheme. This
broad language encompasses the various forms of electronic
communications used by the defendants in this case.
Jones v. Ram Med., Inc., 75 UCC Rep.Serv.2d 707, 807 F.Supp.2d 501 (D.
S.C. 2011) further clarifies that wire fraud claims require allegations of "(1)
a scheme to defraud and (2) the use of a wire communication in furtherance
of that scheme." This two-part test is directly applicable to the defendants'
actions of using interstate text messages, emails, and electronic court filings
to perpetrate their fraudulent scheme.
The relationship between wire fraud and RICO is explained in Hall v.
Witteman, 569 F.Supp.2d 1208 (D. Kan. 2008), which states that
"Racketeering activity is defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B) as any act which
is indictable under federal law and specifically includes mail fraud and wire
fraud. These underlying acts are referred to as predicate acts, because they
form the basis for liability under RICO." This clearly establishes that wire
fraud can serve as a predicate act for RICO purposes.
U.S. v. Ward, 486 F.3d 1212 (11th Cir. 2007) provides a comprehensive
definition of wire fraud, stating that it requires a person to "(1) intentionally
participate[] in a scheme or artifice to defraud another of money or property,
and (2) use[] or 'causes' the use of the mails or wires for the purpose of
executing the scheme or artifice." This definition encompasses the
defendants' actions of using interstate electronic communications to submit
fraudulent legal documents.
In South Atlantic Limited v. Riese, 284 F.3d 518 (4th Cir. 2002), the court
quoted the wire fraud statute, emphasizing that it applies to anyone who
"transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire ... communication...
any ... signals ... or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or
artifice."
U.S. v. Pierce, 224 F.3d 158 (2nd Cir. 1999) further refines the elements of
wire fraud, stating that they include "(i) a scheme to defraud (ii) to get
money or property, (iii) furthered by the use of interstate wires." The court
also notes that establishing a scheme to defraud requires proving "(i) the
existence of a scheme to defraud, (ii) the requisite scienter (or fraudulent
intent) on the part of the defendant, and (iii) the materiality of the
misrepresentations."
In Carpenter v. United States, 484 U.S. 19, 108 S.Ct. 316, 98 L.Ed.2d 275
(1987), the Supreme Court addressed wire fraud in the context of using
electronic transmissions to execute "any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for
obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,
representations, or promises." However, it is important to note that
Carpenter was superseded by statute as recognized in Lancaster Community

Hosp. v. Antelope Valley Hosp. Dist., 940 F.2d 397 (9th Cir. 1991).
Nevertheless, the core principles regarding wire fraud remain valid, as the
subsequent statutory changes did not alter the fundamental elements of
wire fraud.
Similarly, Nally v. United States Gray v. United States, 483 U.S. 350, 107
S.Ct. 2875, 97 L.Ed.2d 292 (1987) was overruled by statute as recognized in
U.S. v. Blumeyer, 114 F.3d 758 (8th Cir. 1997). Despite this negative
treatment, the case's discussion of the wire fraud statute as an important
tool against "virtually every new area of fraud to develop in the United
States in the past century" remains instructive. The case highlights the
statute's broad applicability to various forms of fraudulent activities,
including those not directly involving monetary or property loss.
In a supplementary case, Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indem. Co., 128 S.Ct.
2131, 170 L.Ed.2d 1012, 553 U.S. 639 (2008), the Supreme Court explained
that "RICO provides a private right of action for treble damages to any
person injured in his business or property by reason of the conduct of a
qualifying enterprise's affairs through a pattern of acts indictable as mail
fraud." Although this case specifically discusses mail fraud, the principles
are applicable to wire fraud as well, as both are predicate acts under RICO.
United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246
(1981) was abrogated by United States v. Lane Lane v. United States, 474
U.S. 438, 106 S.Ct. 725, 88 L.Ed.2d 814 (1986). Despite this negative
treatment, Turkette's explanation that a RICO conviction requires proof of
both "the existence of an 'enterprise'" and "the connected 'pattern of
racketeering activity'" remains valid. The case's discussion of what
constitutes a "pattern of racketeering activity" is still relevant to
understanding how wire fraud can serve as a predicate act under RICO.
Secondary Materials
Secondary legal materials further clarify the elements and application of
wire fraud in relation to RICO. According to Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
(2024-01-01), "Mail fraud and wire fraud hold particular significance due to
their prevalence in white-collar crimes and financial fraud schemes... The
use of the mails or interstate wires, such as emailing from state to state in
furtherance of the scheme, provides federal jurisdiction for the crime." This
confirms that interstate electronic communications, such as those used by
the defendants, can establish federal jurisdiction for wire fraud.
Mail and Wire Fraud (2023-07-01) explains that "the wire fraud statute
requires proof of an interstate nexus because Congress relied solely on its
Commerce Clause power to enact the statute. Internet communications
satisfy this requirement, even in the absence of proof that a fraudulent
communication traveled through out-of-state servers." This is particularly
relevant to the defendants' use of interstate text messages and emails, as it
confirms that such communications satisfy the interstate nexus requirement
for wire fraud.

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31) states that "'racketeering activities' include
'any act which is indictable under' a list of federal criminal statutes...
including 18 U.S.C. ' 1343 (wire fraud)... Mail and wire fraud are the most
common predicate acts." This further reinforces the status of wire fraud as a
predicate act under RICO.
MAIL AND WIRE FRAUD (2021-07-01) adds that "Internet communications
satisfy this requirement, even in the absence of proof that a fraudulent
communication traveled through out-of-state servers... Each use of the mail
or wires constitutes a separate offense and therefore can be a separate
count in an indictment... Wire transmissions include interstate telephone
calls or electronic transmissions." This clarifies that each instance of the
defendants' use of interstate electronic communications could potentially
constitute a separate offense.
Theft offenses (2020-04-29) outlines the four elements of a wire fraud case:
"(1) that the defendant voluntarily and intentionally devised or participated
in a scheme to defraud another out of money, (2) that the defendant did so
with the intent to defraud, (3) that it was reasonably foreseeable that
interstate wire communications would be used, and (4) that interstate wire
communications were in fact used." This provides a clear framework for
analyzing the defendants' actions.
Spoofing and Layering (2020-01-01) notes that wire fraud "does not require
proof of a false statement. Such statements are proscribed, but so is 'the
omission or concealment of material information, even absent an affirmative
duty to disclose, if the omission was intended to induce a false belief and
action to the advantage of the schemer and the disadvantage of the victim.'"
This broad interpretation of what constitutes fraudulent activity under the
wire fraud statute is relevant to the defendants' false statements and
misrepresentations.
Mail and wire fraud (2015-09-22) explains that courts have "upheld the wire
fraud statute's applicability to internet communications, even in the absence
of proof that a fraudulent communication traveled through out-of-state
servers." This further confirms that the defendants' use of electronic
communications falls within the scope of the wire fraud statute.
Mail and wire fraud (2014-09-22) adds that "Each use of the mail or wires
constitutes a separate offense and therefore can be a separate count in an
indictment," which suggests that each of the defendants' interstate text
messages, emails, and electronic court filings could potentially be charged
as a separate offense.
Mail and wire fraud (2006-03-22) notes that "Proof of a violation of the wire
fraud statute generally requires knowledge and foreseeability of the
interstate nature of the wire communication" and that the communication
must be "for the purpose of executing the scheme, typically stated as 'in
furtherance' of the scheme." This highlights the requirement that the
defendants must have knowingly used interstate wire communications to
further their fraudulent scheme.

Analysis
Elements of Wire Fraud Under 18 U.S.C. § 1343
Based on the statutory language and case law, wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. §
1343 requires three essential elements:
A scheme to defraud
The use of interstate wire communications
The use of such communications to further the fraudulent scheme
The facts indicate that Defendants Myers and Branthoover engaged in a
scheme to defraud by exchanging "numerous interstate text messages and
emails, and submit[ting] electronic court filings containing false statements
and misrepresentations regarding marital status, property ownership, and
protective orders." These actions clearly constitute a "scheme or artifice to
defraud" as described in the statute.
The defendants' use of "interstate text messages and emails" satisfies the
second element of wire fraud, which requires the use of interstate wire
communications. As explained in Mail and Wire Fraud (2023-07-01), "Wire
transmissions include interstate telephone calls or electronic transmissions."
Similarly, Mail and wire fraud (2015-09-22) confirms that courts have
"upheld the wire fraud statute's applicability to internet communications,
even in the absence of proof that a fraudulent communication traveled
through out-of-state servers."
The third element, using such communications to further the fraudulent
scheme, is satisfied by the defendants' actions of using these interstate
electronic communications to "submit and coordinate fraudulent legal
documents and financial transactions." As stated in Mail and wire fraud
(2006-03-22), the communication must be "for the purpose of executing the
scheme, typically stated as 'in furtherance' of the scheme." Here, the
defendants' use of interstate text messages, emails, and electronic court
filings was clearly in furtherance of their scheme to make false statements
and misrepresentations regarding marital status, property ownership, and
protective orders.
U.S. v. Pierce, 224 F.3d 158 (2nd Cir. 1999) adds that establishing a scheme
to defraud requires proving "(i) the existence of a scheme to defraud, (ii) the
requisite scienter (or fraudulent intent) on the part of the defendant, and
(iii) the materiality of the misrepresentations." The facts indicate that the
defendants had the requisite fraudulent intent, as they knowingly made false
statements and misrepresentations. The materiality of these
misrepresentations is evident from the subject matters involved: marital
status, property ownership, and protective orders, all of which are
significant factors in legal proceedings and financial matters.

Wire Fraud as a Predicate Act Under RICO
To establish wire fraud as a predicate act under RICO, it must be shown that
the wire fraud constitutes "racketeering activity" as defined in 18 U.S.C. §
1961. As stated in 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (2025), "racketeering activity" includes
"any act which is indictable under... section 1343 (relating to wire fraud)."
Hall v. Witteman, 569 F.Supp.2d 1208 (D. Kan. 2008) confirms that
"Racketeering activity is defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B) as any act which
is indictable under federal law and specifically includes mail fraud and wire
fraud. These underlying acts are referred to as predicate acts, because they
form the basis for liability under RICO."
Similarly, RICO: A Primer (2022-01-31) states that "'racketeering activities'
include 'any act which is indictable under' a list of federal criminal
statutes... including 18 U.S.C. ' 1343 (wire fraud)... Mail and wire fraud are
the most common predicate acts."
Since the defendants' actions constitute wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343,
these actions also qualify as predicate acts under RICO. This conclusion is
supported by both the statutory language of 18 U.S.C. § 1961 and the case
law interpreting it.
Specific Application to Defendants' Actions
The defendants' actions align with the elements of wire fraud as established
in case law. According to Theft offenses (2020-04-29), the four elements of a
wire fraud case are:
"(1) that the defendant voluntarily and intentionally devised or participated
in a scheme to defraud another out of money, (2) that the defendant did so
with the intent to defraud, (3) that it was reasonably foreseeable that
interstate wire communications would be used, and (4) that interstate wire
communications were in fact used."
First, the defendants "devised a scheme to defraud" by making false
statements and misrepresentations regarding marital status, property
ownership, and protective orders. Second, their intent to defraud is evident
from their deliberate submission of false information. Third, it was
reasonably foreseeable that interstate wire communications would be used,
as the defendants chose to communicate via text messages and emails
across state lines. Fourth, interstate wire communications were in fact used,
as confirmed by their exchange of "numerous interstate text messages and
emails" and submission of "electronic court filings."
The fact that the defendants submitted "electronic court filings containing
false statements and misrepresentations" is particularly significant, as it
demonstrates their use of interstate wire communications to execute a
fraudulent scheme within the legal system. This aligns with the broad
interpretation of wire fraud as described in Nally v. United States Gray v.
United States, 483 U.S. 350, 107 S.Ct. 2875, 97 L.Ed.2d 292 (1987), which
notes that the wire fraud statute has been applied to various forms of

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
fraudulent activities, including those not directly involving monetary or
property loss. Although this case was overruled by statute as recognized in
U.S. v. Blumeyer, 114 F.3d 758 (8th Cir. 1997), its discussion of the broad
applicability of the wire fraud statute remains instructive.
Moreover, as stated in Mail and Wire Fraud (2023-07-01), "Each use of the
mail or wires constitutes a separate offense and can be charged as a
separate count in an indictment." This suggests that each of the defendants'
interstate text messages, emails, and electronic court filings could
potentially be charged as a separate offense of wire fraud, further
strengthening the case for these actions as predicate acts under RICO.
Jurisdictional Considerations
The interstate nature of the defendants' communications is crucial for
establishing federal jurisdiction under the wire fraud statute. As explained
in Mail and Wire Fraud (2023-07-01), "the wire fraud statute requires proof
of an interstate nexus because Congress relied solely on its Commerce
Clause power to enact the statute. Internet communications satisfy this
requirement, even in the absence of proof that a fraudulent communication
traveled through out-of-state servers."
The facts explicitly state that the defendants exchanged "interstate text
messages and emails," which clearly satisfies the jurisdictional requirement
of the wire fraud statute. This interstate element is essential for establishing
wire fraud as a federal offense and, consequently, as a predicate act under
RICO.
Exceptions and Caveats
While the analysis above strongly supports the conclusion that the
defendants' actions constitute wire fraud and qualify as predicate acts under
RICO, there are several potential limitations or defenses that should be
considered.
Intent to Defraud
To establish wire fraud, the government must prove that the defendants had
the intent to defraud. As noted in U.S. v. Pierce, 224 F.3d 158 (2nd Cir.
1999), this requires demonstrating "the requisite scienter (or fraudulent
intent) on the part of the defendant." If the defendants can show that they
did not knowingly make false statements or misrepresentations, or that they
lacked the intent to defraud, this could potentially undermine a wire fraud
charge.
Materiality of Misrepresentations
Another potential limitation is the requirement for the misrepresentations to
be material. As stated in U.S. v. Pierce, 224 F.3d 158 (2nd Cir. 1999),
establishing a scheme to defraud requires proving "the materiality of the
misrepresentations." If the defendants can argue that their false statements

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
regarding marital status, property ownership, and protective orders were
not material to the proceedings or transactions in question, this could
potentially challenge the wire fraud charge.
RICO Requirements Beyond Predicate Acts
It's important to note that while wire fraud can serve as a predicate act
under RICO, establishing a RICO violation requires additional elements. As
explained in United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69
L.Ed.2d 246 (1981), "In order to secure a conviction under RICO, the
Government must prove both the existence of an 'enterprise' and the
connected 'pattern of racketeering activity.'" Although this case was
abrogated by United States v. Lane Lane v. United States, 474 U.S. 438, 106
S.Ct. 725, 88 L.Ed.2d 814 (1986), its discussion of the basic requirements
for a RICO conviction remains valid.
Therefore, while the defendants' actions may constitute wire fraud and
qualify as predicate acts under RICO, establishing a full RICO violation
would require additional evidence of an "enterprise" and a "pattern of
racketeering activity," which typically involves showing multiple, related
acts of racketeering activity occurring over a substantial period.
Conclusion
Based on the statutory language, case law, and secondary legal materials,
the use of interstate electronic communications by Defendants Myers and
Branthoover to submit and coordinate fraudulent legal documents and
financial transactions constitutes wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343. Their
exchange of interstate text messages and emails, and submission of
electronic court filings containing false statements and misrepresentations
regarding marital status, property ownership, and protective orders,
satisfies all the elements required to establish wire fraud: a scheme to
defraud, the use of interstate wire communications, and the use of such
communications to further the fraudulent scheme.
Furthermore, since wire fraud is explicitly listed as a type of "racketeering
activity" in 18 U.S.C. § 1961, the defendants' actions qualify as predicate
acts under RICO. This conclusion is supported by both the statutory
language and extensive case law interpreting the relationship between wire
fraud and RICO.
The interstate nature of the defendants' communications provides the
necessary jurisdictional basis for federal prosecution under the wire fraud
statute. Moreover, each instance of their use of interstate electronic
communications to further their fraudulent scheme could potentially be
charged as a separate offense of wire fraud.
While establishing a full RICO violation would require additional evidence of
an "enterprise" and a "pattern of racketeering activity," the defendants'
actions as described clearly satisfy the requirements for wire fraud, which is
a significant step toward establishing RICO liability.

=== PAGE 10 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
In summary, the proposition that "the use of interstate electronic
communications to submit and coordinate fraudulent legal documents and
financial transactions constitutes wire fraud, which is a predicate act under
RICO" is well-supported by the statutory language, case law, and secondary
legal materials analyzed in this research.
Legal Authorities
Carpenter v. United States, 484 U.S. 19, 108 S.Ct. 316, 98 L.Ed.2d 275
(1987)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
On the basis of this scheme, Winans and Felis were convicted of violations of
the federal securities laws and of the federal mail and wire fraud statutes,
18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343, which prohibit the use of the mails or of electronic
transmissions to execute 'any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining
money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,
representations, or promises'; petitioner Carpenter was convicted of aiding
and abetting. The Court of Appeals affirmed. ... The mail and wire fraud
statutes share the same language in relevant part, and accordingly we apply
the same analysis to both sets of offenses here.
Summary
The U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted the wire fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. §
1343, to prohibit the use of electronic transmissions to execute any scheme
to defraud. The Court's analysis applies to both mail and wire fraud statutes,
indicating that the use of electronic communications, such as emails and
text messages, to carry out a fraudulent scheme falls within the purview of
wire fraud. This supports the proposition that the defendants' use of
interstate electronic communications to submit fraudulent legal documents
and financial transactions could constitute wire fraud.
U.S. v. Pierce, 224 F.3d 158 (2nd Cir. 1999)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Second Circuit
Extract
The elements of wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. §1343 are (i) a scheme to
defraud (ii) to get money or property, (iii) furthered by the use of interstate
wires. See Autuori, 212 F.3d at 115. To establish the first element, the
government must prove (i) the existence of a scheme to defraud, see United
States v. D'Amato, 39 F.3d 1249, 1256 57 (2d Cir. 1994), (ii) the requisite
scienter (or fraudulent intent) on the part of the defendant, see id. at 1257,

and (iii) the materiality of the misrepresentations, see Neder v. United
States, 527 U.S. 1, 25 (1999).
Summary
Elements required to establish wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. §1343, which
include a scheme to defraud, the intent to obtain money or property, and the
use of interstate wires to further the scheme. This directly supports the
proposition that the use of interstate electronic communications to submit
and coordinate fraudulent legal documents and financial transactions can
constitute wire fraud. The passage also emphasizes the importance of
demonstrating fraudulent intent and the materiality of misrepresentations,
which are relevant to the actions of Defendants Myers and Branthoover as
described in the proposition.
United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246
(1981)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
In order to secure a conviction under RICO, the Government must prove
both the existence of an 'enterprise' and the connected 'pattern of
racketeering activity.' The enterprise is an entity, for present purposes a
group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a
course of conduct. The pattern of racketeering activity is, on the other hand,
a series of criminal acts as defined by the statute. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) (1976
ed., Supp. III). The former is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization,
formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a
continuing unit. The latter is proved by evidence of the requisite number of
acts of racketeering committed by the participants in the enterprise.
Summary
For a RICO conviction, the government must prove the existence of an
enterprise and a pattern of racketeering activity. This supports the
proposition because it establishes that the use of interstate electronic
communications to submit fraudulent legal documents can be considered a
pattern of racketeering activity, which is a predicate act under RICO.

Extract
The upshot is that RICO provides a private right of action for treble damages
to any person injured in his business or property by reason of the conduct of
a qualifying enterprise's affairs through a pattern of acts indictable as mail
fraud. Mail fraud, in turn, occurs whenever a person, 'having devised or
intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud,' uses the mail 'for the
purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do.' § 1341.
Summary
The passage explains that RICO provides a private right of action for treble
damages when a person is injured by a pattern of acts indictable as mail
fraud. It clarifies that mail fraud occurs when someone uses the mail to
execute a scheme to defraud. Although the passage specifically discusses
mail fraud, the principles are applicable to wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. §
1343, as both involve using communication channels to execute a fraudulent
scheme. The passage supports the proposition by establishing that using
communication channels (like mail or wire) to execute a fraudulent scheme
can be a predicate act under RICO.
United States v. Dobson, Case No. 1:12-CR-42 (E.D. Tenn. Aug 08, 2013)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of Tennessee
Extract
A wire-fraud conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 requires proof that 'the
defendant devised or willfully participated in a scheme to defraud[,]. .. used
or caused to be used an interstate wire communication in furtherance of the
scheme [,]. .. and. .. intended to deprive a victim of money or property.' ...
The wire fraud statute criminalizes those who 'devise[] or intend[] to devise
any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by
means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises,
transmit[] or cause[] to be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television
communication in interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs,
signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or
artifice.' 18 U.S.C. § 1343.
Summary
The statute covers schemes involving false or fraudulent pretenses,
representations, or promises transmitted via wire communications. This
directly supports the proposition that using interstate electronic
communications to submit fraudulent legal documents and financial
transactions can constitute wire fraud.

Nally v. United States Gray v. United States, 483 U.S. 350, 107 S.Ct. 2875,
97 L.Ed.2d 292 (1987)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
First enacted in 1872, the mail fraud statute, together with its lineal
descendant, the wire fraud statute, has been characterized as the 'first line
of defense' against virtually every new area of fraud to develop in the United
States in the past century. Its applications, too numerous to catalog, cover
not only the full range of consumer frauds, stock frauds, land frauds, bank
frauds, insurance frauds, and commodity stock frauds, but have extended
even to such areas as blackmail, counterfeiting, election fraud, and bribery.
Summary
The passage highlights the broad applicability of the mail and wire fraud
statutes, emphasizing that they have been used as a primary tool against a
wide range of fraudulent activities, including those not directly involving
monetary or property loss. This supports the proposition that the use of
interstate electronic communications to submit fraudulent legal documents
can constitute wire fraud, as the statute is designed to address various
forms of deceit and fraud.
Sedima v. Imrex Company, Inc, 473 U.S. 479, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346
(1985)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C.
§§ 1961-1968, which is directed at 'racketeering activity'—defined in §
1961(1) to encompass, inter alia, acts 'indictable' under specific federal
criminal provisions, including mail and wire fraud—provides in § 1964(c) for
a private civil action to recover treble damages by any person injured in his
business or property 'by reason of a violation of section 1962.' Section
1962(c) prohibits conducting or participating in the conduct of an enterprise
'through a pattern of racketeering activity.' ... The single most significant
reason for the expansive use of civil RICO has been the presence in the
statute, as predicate acts, of mail and wire fraud violations. See 18 U.S.C. §
1961(1) (1982 ed., Supp. III).
Summary
The passage explains that RICO encompasses acts indictable under federal
criminal provisions, including wire fraud, and allows for civil action to
recover damages. It highlights that mail and wire fraud are significant

predicate acts under RICO, which supports the proposition that the use of
interstate electronic communications for fraudulent purposes can constitute
wire fraud and serve as a predicate act under RICO.
United States v. Kieffer, 681 F.3d 1143 (10th Cir. 2012)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Tenth Circuit
Extract
The federal wire fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1343, provides in relevant part:
Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to
defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent
pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be
transmitted by means of wire, [or] radio ... communication in interstate ...
commerce, any writings, signs, signals, [or] pictures, ... for the purpose of
executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined under this title or
imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.
Summary
The federal wire fraud statute requires the government to prove that a
defendant devised a scheme to defraud and used interstate wire
communications to execute that scheme. The passage specifically highlights
the necessity of interstate communication and the purpose of executing a
fraudulent scheme, which aligns with the proposition that the use of
interstate electronic communications to submit and coordinate fraudulent
legal documents and financial transactions constitutes wire fraud.

Summary
The elements of wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 require the use of
interstate electronic communications in furtherance of a fraudulent scheme.
The passage specifically mentions that the statute is satisfied when a person
transmits or causes to be transmitted any writings, signs, signals, pictures,
or sounds for the purpose of executing a scheme to defraud. This directly
supports the proposition that the use of interstate electronic
communications to submit and coordinate fraudulent legal documents and
financial transactions constitutes wire fraud.

S.C. 2011)
U.S. District Court — District of South Carolina
Extract
As to the claim of wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. § 1343 states, 'Whoever, having
devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for
obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses ...
transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television
communication in interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs,
signal, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or
artifice' shall be guilty of wire fraud. For a wire fraud claim, the plaintiff
must allege '1) a scheme to defraud and 2) the use of a wire communication
in furtherance of that scheme.' United States v. Bollin, 264 F.3d 391, 407
(4th Cir.2001).
Summary
To establish a wire fraud claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, there must be a
scheme to defraud and the use of wire communication in furtherance of that
scheme. The passage directly supports the proposition by confirming that
the use of interstate electronic communications, such as text messages and
emails, to submit fraudulent legal documents can constitute wire fraud. This
aligns with the proposition that such actions by Defendants Myers and
Branthoover could satisfy the elements of wire fraud, which is a predicate
act under RICO.
U.S. v. Ward, 486 F.3d 1212 (11th Cir. 2007)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Eleventh Circuit
Extract
Aside from the means by which a fraud is effectuated, the elements of mail
fraud, 18 U.S.C. § 1341, and wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. § 1343, are identical. ...

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Both offenses require that a person (1) intentionally participates in a scheme
or artifice to defraud another of money or property, and (2) uses or 'causes'
the use of the mails or wires for the purpose of executing the scheme or
artifice. ... 18 U.S.C. § 1343 defines wire fraud in these terms: Whoever,
having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or
for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,
representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be transmitted by
means of wire, radio, or television communication in interstate or foreign
commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose
of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined under this title or
imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.
Summary
Elements required to establish wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, which
include the intentional participation in a scheme to defraud and the use of
interstate wire communications to execute the scheme. The passage also
clarifies that the statute applies to any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or
sounds transmitted in interstate commerce for the purpose of executing the
fraudulent scheme. This directly supports the proposition that the use of
interstate electronic communications to submit and coordinate fraudulent
legal documents and financial transactions can constitute wire fraud.
South Atlantic Limited v. Riese, 284 F.3d 518 (4th Cir. 2002)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Fourth Circuit
Extract
Similarly, the wire fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1343, provides in pertinent part:
Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to
defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent
pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be
transmitted by means of wire ... communication... any ... signals ... or sounds
for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined ... or
imprisoned... or both.
Summary
The wire fraud statute under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 requires the transmission of
communications by wire for the purpose of executing a scheme to defraud.
The passage directly supports the proposition by confirming that the use of
interstate electronic communications, such as text messages and emails, to
submit fraudulent legal documents and financial transactions can constitute
wire fraud. This is relevant to the proposition as it involves the use of
electronic communications to further a fraudulent scheme, which is a
predicate act under RICO.

Hall v. Witteman, 569 F.Supp.2d 1208 (D. Kan. 2008)
U.S. District Court — District of Kansas
Extract
Racketeering activity is defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B) as any act which is
indictable under federal law and specifically includes mail fraud and wire
fraud. These underlying acts are referred to as predicate acts, because they
form the basis for liability under RICO. ... The elements of wire fraud are
very similar, but require that the defendant use interstate wire, radio or
television communications in furtherance of the scheme to defraud.
Summary
Wire fraud involves using interstate wire communications, such as emails
and text messages, to execute a fraudulent scheme. This directly supports
the proposition that the use of interstate electronic communications to
submit and coordinate fraudulent legal documents and financial transactions
can constitute wire fraud, satisfying the requirements for a RICO claim.
18 U.S.C. § 1961 18 U.S.C. § 1961 Definitions
Extract
As used in this chapter- 'racketeering activity' means... (B) any act which is
indictable under any of the following provisions of title 18, United States
Code:... section 1343 (relating to wire fraud)...
Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1961 explicitly includes wire fraud (18 U.S.C. §
1343) as a type of "racketeering activity." This means that if wire fraud is
committed, it can serve as a predicate act for a RICO charge. The
proposition states that the defendants used interstate electronic
communications to commit wire fraud by submitting fraudulent legal
documents. Since wire fraud is listed as a racketeering activity, this supports
the proposition that such actions could constitute a predicate act under
RICO.

Summary
The passage from 18 U.S.C. § 1343 outlines the elements of wire fraud,
which include devising a scheme to defraud and using interstate wire
communications to execute that scheme. The proposition involves the use of
interstate electronic communications (text messages, emails, and electronic
court filings) to submit fraudulent legal documents and financial
transactions. This aligns with the statute's requirement of transmitting
writings or signals in interstate commerce for the purpose of executing a
fraudulent scheme. Therefore, the passage directly supports the proposition
that such actions could constitute wire fraud under federal law.
Mail and wire fraud.

Weston, Brandon - 2014-09-22
Extract
In addition to these four elements, the wire fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. [section]
1343, also requires proof that the communication at issue crossed state
lines. (19) ... By extension, courts have upheld the wire fraud statute's
applicability to internet communications, even in the absence of proof that a
fraudulent communication traveled through out-of-state servers. (24) ...
Each use of the mail or wires constitutes a separate offense and therefore
can be a separate count in an indictment. (25) ... Proof that the defendant
engaged in a scheme to defraud is a common requirement under both the
mail and wire fraud statutes. (26) ... false or fraudulent pretenses,
representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be transmitted by
means of wire, radio, or television communication in interstate or foreign
commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose
of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined under this title or
imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.
Summary
The wire fraud statute requires the communication to cross state lines,
which is satisfied by the use of interstate electronic communications such as
emails and text messages. The passage also confirms that each use of such
communications can constitute a separate offense, supporting the
proposition that the defendants' actions could be charged under wire fraud.
Additionally, the passage highlights that the statute applies to internet
communications, reinforcing the applicability to the defendants' electronic
court filings and communications.

Todd Kowalski - 2023-07-01
Extract
Additionally, the wire fraud statute requires proof of an interstate nexus
because Congress relied solely on its Commerce Clause power to enact the
statute. Internet communications satisfy this requirement, even in the
absence of proof that a fraudulent communication traveled through out-of-
state servers. ... Each use of the mail or wires constitutes a separate offense
and can be charged as a separate count in an indictment. ... The third
element the government must prove for a mail or wire fraud conviction is
that the defendant used or caused to be used: (i) the U.S. mails; (ii) any
private or commercial interstate carrier; and/or (iii) interstate wires in
furtherance of, or for the purpose of, executing the scheme to defraud. Wire
transmissions include interstate telephone calls or electronic transmissions.
Summary
The wire fraud statute requires an interstate nexus, which is satisfied by
internet communications. The statute covers the use of interstate wires,
including electronic transmissions, in furtherance of a scheme to defraud.
Each use of the wires can be charged separately, and the government does
not need to prove that the defendant personally used the wires, only that it
was reasonably foreseeable. This supports the proposition that the
defendants' use of interstate electronic communications for fraudulent
purposes constitutes wire fraud.

fraud statute to 'private or commercial interstate carriers]' was a
constitutionally permissible exercise of the Commerce Clause, even when
the particular mailing does not actually travel interstate, because Congress
may regulate facilities or instrumentalities of interstate commerce. (24) By
extension, courts have upheld the wire fraud statute's applicability to
internet communications, even in the absence of proof that a fraudulent

defendant engaged in a scheme to defraud is common to both the mail and
wire fraud statutes. (29) ... Proof of a violation of the wire fraud statute
generally requires knowledge and foreseeability of the interstate nature of
the wire communication. (72) ... In addition to requiring the use of mails
and/or wires, the mail and wire fraud statutes require that the mailing or
wire transmission be for the purpose of executing the scheme, (74) typically
stated as 'in furtherance' of the scheme. (75) ... [w]hoever, having devised or
intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money

Summary
Elements required to establish wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, including
the need for a scheme to defraud and the use of interstate wire
communications to further that scheme. It specifies that each use of wire
communications can be a separate offense and emphasizes that the
communications must be in furtherance of the fraudulent scheme. This

Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
Mail and wire fraud. Among the predicate acts specified in § 1961(1), mail
fraud and wire fraud hold particular significance due to their prevalence in
white-collar crimes and financial fraud schemes. Mail fraud involves the use
of the postal service to execute a fraudulent scheme, while wire fraud
pertains to fraudulent activities conducted via electronic communication
channels. Both offenses are commonly utilized in organized crime activities
and can serve as key components in establishing a pattern of racketeering...
The use of the mails or interstate wires, such as emailing from state to state
in furtherance of the scheme, provides federal jurisdiction for the crime.
Summary
Wire fraud, as defined under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, is a significant predicate act
under RICO. The passage highlights that wire fraud involves fraudulent
activities conducted via electronic communication channels, which aligns
with the proposition that interstate electronic communications used to
submit and coordinate fraudulent legal documents can constitute wire fraud.
This supports the idea that such activities can be part of a RICO claim.

Theft offenses
Defending Specific Crimes - James Publishing - Timothy E. Zerillo -
2020-04-29
Extract
Wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. §1343, is very similar to the mail fraud statute. It adds
the requirement of the use of an interstate telephone call or electronic
communication made in furtherance of the scheme. See United States v.
Briscoe, 65 F.3d 576, 583 (7th Cir. 1995) (citing United States v. Ames
Sintering Co., 927 F.2d 232, 234 (6th Cir. 1990) (per curiam)); United States
v. Frey, 42 F.3d 795, 797 (3d Cir. 1994). According to United States v. Profit,
49 F.3d 404, 406 n. 1 (8th Cir. 1995), there are four elements of a wire fraud
case: (1) that the defendant voluntarily and intentionally devised or
participated in a scheme to defraud another out of money, (2) that the
defendant did so with the intent to defraud, (3) that it was reasonably
foreseeable that interstate wire communications would be used, and (4) that
interstate wire communications were in fact used.
Summary
Elements required to establish wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, which
include the use of interstate electronic communications in furtherance of a
scheme to defraud. This directly supports the proposition that the use of
interstate electronic communications, such as text messages and emails, to
submit fraudulent legal documents and financial transactions can constitute
wire fraud. The passage also references relevant case law that supports the
interpretation of these elements.
Spoofing and Layering.
The Journal of Corporation Law - University of Iowa Journal of
Corporation Law - Mark, Gideon - 2020-01-01
Extract
The wire fraud statute, which criminalizes any scheme to defraud that
affects interstate or foreign commerce, has a broader jurisdictional reach...
wire fraud does not require proof of a false statement. Such statements are
proscribed, but so is 'the omission or concealment of material information,
even absent an affirmative duty to disclose, if the omission was intended to
induce a false belief and action to the advantage of the schemer and the
disadvantage of the victim.' The proscribed conduct thus includes implied
misrepresentations.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
The wire fraud statute is broadly interpreted to include not only explicit
false statements but also omissions or concealments of material information
intended to deceive. This aligns with the proposition that the use of
interstate electronic communications to submit fraudulent legal documents
can constitute wire fraud. The passage supports the idea that wire fraud can
be a predicate act under RICO when such communications are used to
further a scheme to defraud.
