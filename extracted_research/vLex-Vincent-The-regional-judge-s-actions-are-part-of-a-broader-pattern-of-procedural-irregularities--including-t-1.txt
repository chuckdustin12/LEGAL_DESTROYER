Question
The regional judge’s actions are part of a broader pattern of procedural
irregularities, including the summary denial of recusal motions without a
hearing, the involvement of non-neutral court staff, and the failure to
provide an adequate appellate remedy, as evidenced by multiple concurrent
mandamus petitions and repeated per curiam denials without substantive
review. Due process under the Texas and U.S. Constitutions requires a fair
and impartial tribunal. When a judge’s conduct creates a reasonable doubt
as to impartiality, recusal is required. See *Ex parte Sinegar*, 324 S.W.3d
578 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010); *Canon 2(A), Texas Code of Judicial Conduct*.
The regional judge’s repeated failure to enforce or follow mandatory recusal
procedures, and the resulting deprivation of a meaningful appellate remedy,
demonstrate an inability or unwillingness to provide a fair and impartial
forum. Recusal is necessary to restore confidence in the process and protect
the substantive rights of the parties.
Answer (Texas)
Short response
The regional judge’s repeated failure to follow mandatory recusal
procedures, including denying hearings on recusal motions and failing to
ensure a neutral process, constitutes a pattern of procedural irregularities
that undermines due process and the right to a fair and impartial tribunal
under Texas and U.S. constitutional law. Recusal is required where a judge’s
conduct creates reasonable doubt as to impartiality, and the deprivation of
meaningful appellate remedies further supports the necessity of recusal to
restore confidence in the judicial process.
Summary
Texas law imposes strict, mandatory procedures for handling judicial recusal
motions, requiring that a judge either recuse themselves or refer the motion
to a neutral judge for determination, and that a hearing be held if the motion
is timely and facially sufficient. The failure to follow these procedures—such
as summary denials without a hearing, involvement of non-neutral staff, and
lack of adequate appellate review—violates both statutory requirements and
the fundamental due process right to a fair and impartial tribunal.
Case law from the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and relevant statutes
make clear that the appearance of impartiality is as important as actual
impartiality, and that procedural irregularities in recusal undermine public
confidence in the judiciary. When a judge’s actions create reasonable doubt
as to their impartiality, recusal is not only appropriate but required to
protect the substantive rights of the parties and the integrity of the judicial
process.

Background and Relevant Law
Legislative and Regulatory Framework
Texas law provides a detailed statutory and regulatory scheme governing
the recusal and disqualification of judges. The most directly relevant
provisions are found in the Texas Government Code and the Texas Rules of
Civil Procedure, which are incorporated by reference into criminal
proceedings.
Texas Government Code § 74.059 imposes a mandatory duty on district,
statutory probate, and statutory county court judges: upon the filing of a
recusal motion, the judge must request the presiding judge to assign
another judge to hear the motion. This requirement is not discretionary; it is
a ministerial act designed to ensure that recusal motions are adjudicated by
a neutral party, thereby preserving the appearance and reality of
impartiality (Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.059).
Texas Government Code § 29.055 and § 25.00255 provide similar
mandatory procedures for municipal and statutory probate judges,
respectively. These statutes require that, upon the filing of a recusal motion,
the judge must either recuse themselves or refer the motion to the
appropriate presiding judge, and must refrain from taking further action in
the case until the motion is resolved, except for good cause stated in the
record (Tex. Gov't. Code § 29.055; Tex. Gov't. Code § 25.00255).
1 Tex. Admin. Code § 155.152 further clarifies that if a presiding judge is
the subject of a recusal motion and does not voluntarily recuse, the Chief
Judge or designee must assign another judge to consider and rule on the
motion, with a hearing held at the assigned judge’s discretion.
The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, specifically Rule 18a and 18b, are
incorporated into criminal proceedings and set out the grounds and
procedures for recusal. Rule 18a requires that, upon the filing of a timely
and facially sufficient motion, the judge must either recuse themselves or
refer the motion to the presiding judge for assignment to another judge.
Rule 18b sets out the grounds for recusal, including any situation where the
judge’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned.
Case Law
Texas courts have consistently enforced these statutory and procedural
requirements, emphasizing both the reality and the appearance of
impartiality as essential to due process.
In In re Halprin, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals found that a trial
judge’s failure to adhere to Rule 18b and the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct
—by not recusing when impartiality was reasonably in question—violated
the standards required for judicial conduct and due process (In re Halprin,
708 S.W.3d 1 (Tex. Crim. App. 2024)).

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
In re Lewis and Ex parte Lewis both underscore that the touchstone of
due process is fundamental fairness, and that justice must not only be done
but must also appear to be done. The appearance of impropriety, even
absent proof of actual bias, is sufficient to require recusal to maintain public
confidence in the judiciary (In re Lewis, 688 S.W.3d 351 (Tex. Crim. App.
2024); Ex parte Lewis (Tex. Crim. App. 2024)).
In re Lucio is particularly instructive on the procedural aspect: the court
held that when a recusal motion is timely filed, the trial judge has no
discretion but to either recuse or refer the motion to the presiding judge.
Failure to do so is a ministerial error, and mandamus relief is appropriate
because there is no adequate remedy at law (In re Lucio, 702-03, WR-72
(Tex. Crim. App. Apr 25, 2022)).
McClenan v. State also addressed the mandatory nature of recusal
procedures, emphasizing that a judge should not rule on their own recusal
motion. However, it is important to note that McClenan was overruled by 
De Leon v. Aguilar, which clarified that the procedures for recusal set out
in Rule 18a apply in criminal cases and that mandamus relief is available for
non-compliance even absent a finding of actual bias (McClenan v. State, 661
S.W.2d 108 (Tex. Crim. App. 1983), overruled by De Leon v. Aguilar, 127 S.W.
3d 1 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004)).
Ex parte Thuesen and Ex parte Sinegar (cited in the user’s proposition)
confirm that Rule 18a applies to habeas and criminal proceedings,
reinforcing the universality of these procedural protections (Ex parte
Thuesen, 546 S.W.3d 145 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017); Ex parte Sinegar, 324 S.W.
3d 578 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010)).
Secondary Materials
Secondary sources reinforce these principles, emphasizing that due process
under both the Texas and U.S. Constitutions requires a neutral and unbiased
arbiter, and that the extent of the hearing and the impartiality of the
adjudicator are central to the fairness of the proceeding (Recusal's Own
Conflict of Interest (2025)).
The Texas Criminal Lawyer’s Handbook and related practice guides
uniformly state that if a recusal motion is timely filed and facially sufficient,
a hearing must be held. Denial of a hearing is a procedural error, and the
remedy is to abate the case for a proper hearing (Pretrial motions
(2022-05-05); Trial motions (2022-04-02); Pretrial Motions (2021-08-16); 
Pretrial Motions (2020-08-16); Pretrial Motions (2019-08-16)).
Analysis
Procedural Irregularities and Statutory Violations
The regional judge’s conduct, as described—summary denial of recusal
motions without a hearing, involvement of non-neutral staff, and failure to

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
provide an adequate appellate remedy—constitutes a clear violation of the
mandatory procedures set out in Texas law.
Under Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.059, a judge must request the presiding judge
to assign another judge to hear a recusal motion. The judge has no
discretion to summarily deny the motion or to proceed with the case before
the motion is resolved. This is echoed in Tex. Gov't. Code §§ 29.055 and 
25.00255, which require referral and prohibit further action in the case
until the recusal issue is resolved, except for good cause.
The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, as applied in criminal cases, reinforce
this requirement. Rule 18a mandates that a judge must either recuse or
refer the motion, and Rule 18b sets out the grounds for recusal, including
any situation where impartiality might reasonably be questioned.
The secondary materials and practice guides are unequivocal: if a recusal
motion is timely and facially sufficient, a hearing is mandatory. The judge
cannot simply deny the motion without a hearing. The failure to hold a
hearing is a procedural irregularity that undermines the fairness of the
process and the parties’ due process rights.
Case Law Application
The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has repeatedly held that the
appearance of impartiality is as important as actual impartiality. In In re
Halprin, the court found that failure to adhere to recusal procedures and
the Code of Judicial Conduct undermines the integrity and independence of
the judiciary. The court emphasized that judges must avoid both impropriety
and the appearance of impropriety.
In re Lewis and Ex parte Lewis further establish that the touchstone of
due process is fundamental fairness, and that justice must satisfy the
appearance of justice. Even absent proof of actual bias, the appearance of
impropriety is sufficient to require recusal. This is particularly important
where, as here, the judge’s conduct creates reasonable doubt as to
impartiality.
In re Lucio is directly on point regarding the procedural aspect. The court
held that when a recusal motion is timely filed, the judge has no discretion
but to either recuse or refer the motion. Failure to do so is a ministerial
error, and mandamus relief is appropriate because there is no adequate
remedy at law. This supports the proposition that repeated failures to follow
recusal procedures, coupled with the lack of meaningful appellate remedies
(such as repeated per curiam denials without substantive review),
demonstrate an inability or unwillingness to provide a fair and impartial
forum.
McClenan v. State also addressed the mandatory nature of recusal
procedures, emphasizing that a judge should not rule on their own recusal
motion. However, as noted, McClenan was overruled by De Leon v.
Aguilar, which clarified that the procedures for recusal set out in Rule 18a
apply in criminal cases and that mandamus relief is available for non-

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
compliance even absent a finding of actual bias. The overruling of 
McClenan does not undermine the core principle that judges must not
adjudicate their own recusal motions; rather, it clarifies the procedural
mechanism and the availability of mandamus relief.
Due Process and the Right to a Fair Tribunal
The requirement of a fair and impartial tribunal is rooted in both the Texas
and U.S. Constitutions. Due process demands not only the absence of actual
bias but also the absence of circumstances that might lead a reasonable
person to doubt the judge’s impartiality. The Texas Code of Judicial Conduct,
particularly Canon 2(A), requires judges to act in a manner that promotes
public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.
Secondary materials reinforce that due process is concerned with both the
extent of the hearing provided and the impartiality of the adjudicator. The
failure to provide a hearing on a recusal motion, the involvement of non-
neutral staff, and the lack of meaningful appellate review all undermine the
fairness of the proceeding and the parties’ substantive rights.
Appellate Remedies and Mandamus
Where a judge fails to follow mandatory recusal procedures, the ordinary
appellate process may be inadequate, particularly if the error is not subject
to meaningful review or is repeatedly denied without substantive
consideration. In such cases, mandamus relief is appropriate, as recognized
in In re Lucio and De Leon v. Aguilar. The repeated denial of mandamus
petitions without substantive review further compounds the deprivation of
due process and underscores the necessity of recusal to restore confidence
in the process.
Exceptions and Caveats
While Texas law provides for appellate review of the denial of recusal
motions (typically for abuse of discretion), this remedy is only meaningful if
the underlying procedures are followed. If a judge summarily denies a
recusal motion without a hearing, or if the appellate courts repeatedly deny
relief without substantive review, the statutory and constitutional
guarantees of due process are not satisfied.
It is also important to note that while McClenan v. State was overruled by 
De Leon v. Aguilar, the core principle that a judge should not rule on their
own recusal motion remains valid, as the overruling clarified the procedural
mechanism rather than rejecting the underlying concern about impartiality.
Conclusion
The regional judge’s repeated failure to follow mandatory recusal
procedures—by denying hearings on recusal motions, involving non-neutral
staff, and failing to provide meaningful appellate remedies—constitutes a

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
pattern of procedural irregularities that violates both statutory requirements
and the fundamental due process right to a fair and impartial tribunal. Texas
law is clear that recusal is required whenever a judge’s conduct creates
reasonable doubt as to impartiality, and the deprivation of a meaningful
appellate remedy further supports the necessity of recusal to protect the
substantive rights of the parties and restore confidence in the judicial
process. The authorities provided leave no doubt that adherence to recusal
procedures is essential to the integrity of the Texas judicial system.
Legal Authorities
McClenan v. State, 661 S.W.2d 108 (Tex. Crim. App. 1983)
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
The majority holds that '[t]he trial judge erred in not following Art. 200(a), §
6.' That holding is correct. McLeod v. Harris, 582 S.W.2d 772 (Tex.1979): 'We
conclude that under the express terms of Article 200a, Section 6, Judge
Harris had the mandatory duty to request the Presiding Judge of the Second
Administrative District to assign another district judge to hear relator's
motion to recuse.' Id., at 775. ... It is probably asking too much of judicial
impartiality to expect a judge to rule objectively on a motion that he
disqualify himself from a cause if he has not already recused himself
voluntarily.... A judge should not be placed in the position or be given the
opportunity to rule in such cases.
Summary
The passage highlights the mandatory duty of a judge to request the
assignment of another judge to hear recusal motions, as per Article 200a,
Section 6. The dissenting opinion criticizes the majority for not enforcing
this legislative mandate, emphasizing the importance of impartiality and the
potential bias when a judge rules on their own recusal. This supports the
proposition by illustrating procedural irregularities when a judge fails to
follow mandatory recusal procedures, which can undermine the fairness and
impartiality required by due process.

judge was biased. See McLeod v. Harris, 582 S.W.2d 772, 773-75 (Tex.1979).
Summary
The passage highlights the applicability of Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of
Civil Procedure to criminal cases, which governs the recusal of judges. It
also references a precedent where the Texas Supreme Court granted
mandamus relief due to non-compliance with Rule 18a, even without a
determination of bias. This supports the proposition by illustrating that
procedural irregularities in recusal processes can warrant relief,
emphasizing the importance of following established procedures to ensure
impartiality and due process.

Crim. App. 1993) (stating that Rule 18a 'applies to criminal cases absent
‘any explicit or implicit legislative intent indicating otherwise’').
Summary
The passage references Rule 18a, which governs the procedure for recusal
of judges in Texas. It confirms that Rule 18a applies to habeas proceedings
and criminal cases, as established in *Ex parte Sinegar* and *Arnold v.
State*. This supports the proposition by highlighting the procedural
requirements for recusal, which the regional judge allegedly failed to follow.
The reference to *Ex parte Sinegar* is particularly relevant, as it is directly
cited in the proposition to argue for the necessity of recusal when
impartiality is in question.

Summary
The passage highlights the failure of a trial judge to adhere to the Texas
Rule of Civil Procedure 18b, which mandates recusal when a judge's
impartiality might reasonably be questioned or when there is personal bias.
It also references the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct, emphasizing the
importance of maintaining high standards of conduct to preserve the
integrity and independence of the judiciary. These points directly relate to
the proposition that due process requires a fair and impartial tribunal and
that recusal is necessary when a judge's conduct creates reasonable doubt
as to impartiality.

Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Extract
In her mandamus petition, Relator asserts that she has filed a motion to
recuse or disqualify Respondent, but Respondent has failed to timely rule on
the motion as Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a requires.[] Because
Respondent has refused to rule on the motion or refer it to the regional
presiding judge, Relator contends, this Court should compel Respondent to
act in accordance with Rule 18a. ... In De Leon v. Aguilar, this Court held:
When a recusal motion is timely filed, Rule 18a leaves a trial judge with no
discretion-the trial judge must either recuse himself or refer the motion for
another judge to decide. ... Thus, Relator has shown that the act sought to
be compelled is purely ministerial. ... Therefore, we find that it is not an
adequate remedy at law and Relator has no other adequate remedy at this
time. Consequently, we conditionally grant mandamus relief.
Summary
The passage from "In re Lucio" highlights a situation where a judge failed to
comply with the mandatory procedures for handling a recusal motion, as
outlined in Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a. The court found that the
judge's failure to act was a ministerial error and that the relator had no
adequate legal remedy, thus justifying mandamus relief. This supports the
proposition by illustrating a procedural irregularity where a judge did not

Summary
Importance of the appearance of justice and fundamental fairness as
essential components of due process. It highlights that recusal should be
required when there is a palpable appearance of impropriety, which aligns
with the proposition that a judge's conduct creating reasonable doubt as to
impartiality necessitates recusal. The reference to the relationship between
Petty and Judge Hyde underscores the need for recusal to maintain the
appearance of justice, supporting the argument that procedural
irregularities and failure to follow recusal procedures undermine due
process.

The passage emphasizes the importance of the appearance of justice and
fundamental fairness as essential components of due process. It highlights
that recusal is necessary when there is a palpable appearance of
impropriety, which aligns with the proposition that a judge's conduct

Summary
The passage highlights the importance of due process in judicial
proceedings, specifically the requirement for a neutral and detached hearing
body. The case demonstrates a situation where a judge's actions were
scrutinized for potentially prejudging a punishment, which aligns with the
proposition's concern about procedural irregularities and the need for
impartiality. The court's decision to grant relief and remand the case for
reassessment of the sentence underscores the necessity of maintaining due
process standards.

Recusal's Own Conflict of Interest
Criminal Justice - American Bar Association - Louis J. Virelli III -

Extract
The law of recusal for judges derives from two basic sources: the Due
Process Clause of the Constitu- tion and recusal statutes and codes. Due
process has two analogous, but conceptually distinct, ap- plications, both of

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
which are related to the fairness of the proceeding. First, due process is
concerned with the extent of the hearing provided; the greater a litigant’s
personal stake in the outcome, the more involved the procedures required
by due process. Second, and related, is the requirement of a neutral,
unbiased arbiter. This includes a range of require- ments relating to an
adjudicator’s impartiality, from “an absence of actual bias” against the
parties to the admonitions that “no man shall be a judge in his own case”
and that the “possible temptation to the average man as a judge . . .
Summary
The passage highlights the fundamental principles of recusal law,
emphasizing the importance of due process and the requirement for a
neutral and unbiased arbiter. It underscores that due process is concerned
with both the extent of the hearing provided and the impartiality of the
adjudicator. This directly supports the proposition that due process requires
a fair and impartial tribunal, and when a judge's conduct creates reasonable
doubt as to impartiality, recusal is necessary.

If a recusal motion is timely filed and facially sufficient, a hearing must be
held. Sanchez. Where it is found that a party was erroneously denied the
right to a hearing on their motion to recuse, the remedy is to abate the case
back to the trial court so that such hearing can be held. Sanchez.
Summary
The passage from the Texas Criminal Lawyer's Handbook outlines the
procedural requirement that a hearing must be held if a recusal motion is
timely filed and facially sufficient. This supports the proposition by
highlighting the procedural irregularity of denying a hearing on recusal
motions, which is a key component of the broader pattern of irregularities
alleged. The passage also provides a remedy for such procedural failures,
which aligns with the proposition's assertion of a failure to provide an
adequate appellate remedy.

Extract
The procedural requisites for recusal in Rule 18a(a) are mandatory, and a
party who fails to conform waives his right to complain of a judge’s failure to
recuse himself. ... Once a sufficient motion to recuse has been filed, before
proceeding further in the case, the judge must either recuse himself or
request the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district to assign a
judge to hear the motion under Tex. Gov’t Code §74.059(c)(3). ... If a recusal
motion is timely filed and facially sufficient, a hearing must be held. ...
Where it is found that a party was erroneously denied the right to a hearing
on their motion to recuse, the remedy is to abate the case back to the trial
court so that such hearing can be held.
Summary
Mandatory nature of recusal procedures under Rule 18a(a) and emphasizes
that a judge must either recuse themselves or request another judge to hear
the motion if a sufficient motion is filed. It also highlights the requirement
for a hearing if the motion is timely and facially sufficient. This supports the
proposition by demonstrating that the failure to follow these mandatory
procedures, such as denying a hearing, constitutes a procedural irregularity
that undermines the fairness and impartiality required by due process.
