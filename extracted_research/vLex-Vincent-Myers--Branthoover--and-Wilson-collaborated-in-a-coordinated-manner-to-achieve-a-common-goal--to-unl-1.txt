Question
Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson collaborated in a coordinated manner to
achieve a common goal: to unlawfully remove Plaintiff from his residence,
gain an advantage in divorce proceedings, and finalize the divorce. Myers
and Branthoover communicated across state lines and collaborated on legal
documents, including the divorce petition, affidavit of indigency, and
protective order. Wilson participated by serving eviction notices and using
the U.S. Mail Service to effectuate service on Plaintiff. An "enterprise" under
RICO can include any group of individuals associated in fact, even if it is not
a formal legal entity, as long as it has a common purpose, relationships
among its members, and longevity sufficient to pursue its purpose (Boyle v.
United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009)). The coordinated actions of Myers,
Branthoover, and Wilson demonstrate the existence of an enterprise under
RICO, as they worked together to achieve a shared objective through
ongoing collaboration.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Based on the provided materials, the coordinated actions of Myers,
Branthoover, and Wilson can legally constitute an "enterprise" under RICO,
as they satisfy the three required structural features established in Boyle v.
United States: a common purpose, relationships among those associated
with the enterprise, and sufficient longevity to pursue their objective. Their
interstate communications, collaborative work on legal documents, and use
of the U.S. Mail Service to effectuate their shared goal demonstrate the
existence of an association-in-fact enterprise affecting interstate commerce.
Summary
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) defines an
"enterprise" broadly to include "any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity." The Supreme Court in Boyle v.
United States established that an association-in-fact enterprise requires only
three structural features: a common purpose, relationships among those
associated with the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these
associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose. The coordinated actions of
Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson satisfy these requirements as they worked
together with the common purpose of unlawfully removing the Plaintiff from
his residence, gaining an advantage in divorce proceedings, and finalizing
the divorce.
Their collaboration across state lines in creating legal documents (including
the divorce petition, affidavit of indigency, and protective order) and
Wilson's participation in serving eviction notices using the U.S. Mail Service

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
demonstrate both the relationships among the associates and the longevity
of their association. Additionally, their activities affected interstate
commerce through their interstate communications and use of the U.S. Mail
Service, satisfying RICO's jurisdictional requirement. The definition of
"enterprise" under RICO is deliberately broad and flexible, designed to
encompass a wide range of criminal activity operating in various forms, and
is not limited to traditional notions of organized crime.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislation
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) is codified
at 18 U.S.C. § 1962. Under this statute, it is unlawful for "any person
through a pattern of racketeering activity or through collection of an
unlawful debt to acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest in or
control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which
affect, interstate or foreign commerce." 18 U.S.C. § 1962 ("It shall be
unlawful for any person through a pattern of racketeering activity or
through collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or maintain, directly or
indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or
the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.").
Section 1962 further provides that it is unlawful for "any person employed
by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which
affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of
racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt." 18 U.S.C. § 1962 ("It
shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any
enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or
collection of unlawful debt.").
Additionally, the statute prohibits conspiracy to violate these provisions: "It
shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of the provisions
of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section." 18 U.S.C. § 1962 ("It shall be
unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of the provisions of
subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section.").
Definition of "Enterprise" Under RICO
For the purposes of RICO, the term "enterprise" is defined broadly. While not
included in the provided legislative materials, numerous case law sources
and secondary materials confirm that RICO defines an "enterprise" as "any
individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and
any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal
entity." This definition has been interpreted extensively by courts to
encompass a wide range of associations.

Case Law
The Supreme Court's decision in Boyle v. United States (2009) is particularly
significant in establishing what constitutes an "enterprise" under RICO. In
this case, the Court clarified that an association-in-fact enterprise must have
at least three structural features: (1) a purpose, (2) relationships among
those associated with the enterprise, and (3) longevity sufficient to permit
these associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose. Boyle v. United States,
556 U.S. 938 (2009) ("From the terms of RICO, it is apparent that an
association-in-fact enterprise must have at least three structural features: a
purpose, relationships among those associated with the enterprise, and
longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the enterprise's
purpose. As we succinctly put it in Turkette, an association-in-fact enterprise
is 'a group of persons associated together for a common purpose of
engaging in a course of conduct.'").
The Court in Boyle established that an enterprise is "simply a continuing
unit that functions with a common purpose." United States v. Chester, No. 13
CR 00774 (N.D. Ill. Aug 08, 2017) ("The Supreme Court has defined an
enterprise associated in fact as 'simply a continuing unit that functions with
a common purpose.' Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 948 (2009).").
Importantly, the Boyle Court held that an association-in-fact enterprise does
not require formal structural attributes. United States v. Chester, No. 13 CR
00774 (N.D. Ill. Aug 08, 2017) ("The absence of the structural attributes of a
more formal enterprise is not material. United States v. Olson, 450 F.3d 655,
664 (7th Cir. 2006) ('We have held that in informal organizations such as
criminal groups, there 'must be some structure, to distinguish an enterprise
from a mere conspiracy, but there need not be much.').").
Courts have consistently interpreted the definition of "enterprise" broadly. In
Donaldson v. Primary Residential Mortg., the court noted that RICO "defines
an 'enterprise' as 'any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or
other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact
although not a legal entity.'" Donaldson v. Primary Residential Mortg., Civil
Action No. ELH-19-1175 (D. Md. Jun 12, 2020) ("RICO defines an 'enterprise'
as 'any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal
entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not
a legal entity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4). See, e.g., Boyle, 556 U.S. at 944...").
In United States v. Hosseini, the Seventh Circuit emphasized that the
Supreme Court reads the definition of "enterprise" quite broadly. United
States v. Hosseini, 679 F.3d 544 (7th Cir. 2012) ("The RICO statute defines
'enterprise' as including 'any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4) (emphasis
added). The Supreme Court reads this definition quite broadly.").
In Brown v. Hanover Am. Ins. Co., the court reiterated the Supreme Court's
explanation that "an enterprise includes any union or group of individuals
associated in fact" and that RICO reaches "a group of persons associated
together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct." Brown

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
v. Hanover Am. Ins. Co., Case No. 2:20-cv-02415 (W.D. Tenn. Jul 14, 2021)
("The Supreme Court has not defined the outer boundaries of a RICO
enterprise, but has explained that 'an enterprise includes any union or group
of individuals associated in fact' and that RICO reaches 'a group of persons
associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of
conduct.' Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 944 (2009) (citing United
States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 580, 583 (1985)).").
Interstate Commerce Requirement
For a RICO violation to exist, the enterprise must engage in or affect
interstate commerce. In Portionpac Chemical Corp. v. Sanitech Systems, the
court noted that RICO makes it unlawful to conduct or participate in "the
affairs of any enterprise which affects interstate commerce through a
pattern of racketeering activity or collection of an unlawful debt." 
Portionpac Chemical Corp. v. Sanitech Systems, 217 F.Supp.2d 1238 (M.D.
Fla. 2002) ("Congress designed the Federal Racketeering Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), Title 18, United States Code, Section
1961, et seq. as a flexible tool to fight organized crime. As such, it makes the
following activities unlawful: [...] (c) conducting or participating in the
affairs of any enterprise which affects interstate commerce through a
pattern of racketeering activity or collection of an unlawful debt;").
However, RICO requires only a minimal effect on interstate commerce to
satisfy this jurisdictional requirement. Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy ("RICO
requires no more than a slight effect upon interstate commerce. Even a
minimal effect on interstate commerce satisfies this jurisdictional
requirement.").
Pattern of Racketeering Activity
In addition to establishing an enterprise, RICO requires a "pattern of
racketeering activity." In H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company,
the Supreme Court established that to prove a pattern of racketeering
activity, a plaintiff must show both "relationship" and "continuity" among the
racketeering predicates. Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492
U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989) ("RICO's legislative
history, however, establishes that Congress intended that to prove a 'pattern
of racketeering activity' a plaintiff or prosecutor must show both
'relationship' and 'continuity'—that the racketeering predicates are related,
and that they either constitute or threaten long-term criminal activity.").
Importantly, the Court clarified that RICO is not limited to traditional notions
of organized crime. Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492 U.S.
229, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989) ("Neither RICO's language nor
its legislative history supports a rule that a defendant's racketeering
activities form a pattern only if they are characteristic of organized crime.
No such restriction appears in RICO's text. ... Title 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) (1982
ed., Supp. V), with its very generous definition of 'racketeering activity,'
acknowledges the breakdown of the traditional conception of organized

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
crime, and responds to a new situation in which persons engaged in long-
term criminal activity often operate wholly within legitimate enterprises.").
Secondary Materials
Secondary sources provided further confirm the broad interpretation of
"enterprise" under RICO. According to "RICO: A Primer," courts have
interpreted the term "enterprise" broadly to capture both legitimate and
illegitimate enterprises. RICO: A Primer ("A RICO enterprise includes 'any
individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and
any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal
entity.' Courts have interpreted 'enterprise' broadly, and the definition
captures both legitimate and illegitimate enterprises. The statutory list is
not exhaustive but merely illustrative.").
Similarly, another secondary source notes that federal courts have
significant discretion in recognizing a RICO enterprise, with only minimal
requirements that it be an ongoing organization whose associates operate as
a continuous unit. What can RICO not do? RICO and the non-economic
intrastate enterprise that perpetrates only non-economic racketeering
activity ("Enterprise and racketeering activity, defined in [section] 1961(1)
and (4) of RICO, are generous in scope. (31) '[A]ny individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity' can constitute a
RICO enterprise. (32) Federal courts have a significant amount of discretion
in recognizing a RICO enterprise. (33) There is no rigid standard that must
be satisfied. (34) Minimally, a RICO enterprise must be an ongoing
organization, formal or informal, whose associates operate as a continuous
unit. (35)").
Analysis
Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson as an "Enterprise" Under
RICO
Based on the provided legal authorities, the coordinated actions of Myers,
Branthoover, and Wilson can be analyzed to determine whether they
constitute an "enterprise" under RICO. The Supreme Court in Boyle
established three essential structural features for an association-in-fact
enterprise: (1) a purpose, (2) relationships among those associated with the
enterprise, and (3) longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue
the enterprise's purpose.
Common Purpose
The facts indicate that Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson collaborated "to
achieve a common goal: to unlawfully remove Plaintiff from his residence,
gain an advantage in divorce proceedings, and finalize the divorce." This
shared objective satisfies the "purpose" requirement established in Boyle. 
Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009) ("From the terms of RICO, it is

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
apparent that an association-in-fact enterprise must have at least three
structural features: a purpose, relationships among those associated with
the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue
the enterprise's purpose.").
As noted in United States v. Chester, "The purpose may be illegitimate." 
United States v. Chester, No. 13 CR 00774 (N.D. Ill. Aug 08, 2017) ("The
purpose may be illegitimate. Turkette, 452 U.S. at 587."). Therefore, the
allegedly unlawful nature of their goal does not preclude the finding of an
enterprise.
Relationships Among Associates
The coordinated actions of Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson demonstrate
relationships among them. Specifically, "Myers and Branthoover
communicated across state lines and collaborated on legal documents,
including the divorce petition, affidavit of indigency, and protective order."
Additionally, "Wilson participated by serving eviction notices and using the
U.S. Mail Service to effectuate service on Plaintiff." These actions indicate
coordination and collaboration among the three individuals, satisfying the
"relationships" requirement of a RICO enterprise.
In Chambers v. King Buick GMC, LLC, the court noted that an enterprise can
be evidenced by cooperation, joint agreements, and use of common
procedures to achieve a shared objective. Chambers v. King Buick GMC,
LLC, 43 F. Supp. 3d 575 (D. Md. 2014) ("Plaintiff asserts: Defendants have
an agreement to work together to market and sell used vehicles and actively
are doing so. Defendants' cross-marketing and commingling and/or sharing
of inventory and Carfax reports is evidence of their cooperation, joint
agreements, and use of common procedures and documents to unlawfully
sell such used vehicles without the disclosure required by Maryland law...").
Similarly, in this case, the collaboration on legal documents and coordinated
actions to remove the Plaintiff from his residence and facilitate divorce
proceedings demonstrates the relationships among Myers, Branthoover, and
Wilson within the enterprise.
Sufficient Longevity
The facts suggest that the collaboration among Myers, Branthoover, and
Wilson extended over a period sufficient to accomplish their purpose. They
engaged in multiple coordinated activities, including preparing legal
documents, serving eviction notices, and completing divorce proceedings.
This ongoing collaboration demonstrates "longevity sufficient to permit
these associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose," as required by Boyle. 
Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009).
In Odom v. Microsoft Corp., the court found that an enterprise requires
"continuity of structure" and an "organizational pattern or system of
authority." U.S. v. Olson, 450 F.3d 655 (7th Cir. 2006) ("... a RICO enterprise
is an ongoing structure of persons associated through time, joined in
purpose, and organized in a manner amenable to hierarchical or consensual

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
decision-making; ... continuity of structure exists where there is an
organizational pattern or system of authority that provides a mechanism for
directing the group."). The coordinated actions of Myers, Branthoover, and
Wilson suggest an organizational structure that allowed them to work
together toward their common goal over time.
No Formal Structure Required
Importantly, the absence of a formal legal structure among Myers,
Branthoover, and Wilson does not preclude finding an enterprise under
RICO. As established in Boyle and reiterated in subsequent cases, a RICO
enterprise does not require formal structural attributes. United States v.
Chester, No. 13 CR 00774 (N.D. Ill. Aug 08, 2017) ("The absence of the
structural attributes of a more formal enterprise is not material.").
Additionally, secondary sources confirm that "an enterprise need not have a
hierarchy, chain of command, fixed roles, or appear as a business-like
entity." From the sophisticated undertakings of the Genovese crime family to
the everyday criminal: the loss of congressional intent in modern criminal
RICO application ("Because Congress included no structural requirements in
the RICO statute, the Court specifically noted that an enterprise need not
have a hierarchy, chain of command, fixed roles, or appear as a business-like
entity."). Therefore, the informal nature of the collaboration among Myers,
Branthoover, and Wilson does not prevent it from being considered an
enterprise under RICO.
Interstate Commerce Element
To establish a RICO violation, the enterprise must engage in or affect
interstate commerce. The facts indicate that "Myers and Branthoover
communicated across state lines" and that Wilson used "the U.S. Mail
Service to effectuate service on Plaintiff." These actions demonstrate an
effect on interstate commerce.
As noted in the secondary source "Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy," RICO
requires only "a slight effect upon interstate commerce" and "Even a
minimal effect on interstate commerce satisfies this jurisdictional
requirement." Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy. The interstate communications
and use of the U.S. Mail Service by Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson satisfy
this minimal requirement.
Pattern of Racketeering Activity
While the focus of the question is on whether the coordinated actions of
Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson constitute an "enterprise" under RICO, it is
worth noting that a RICO violation also requires a "pattern of racketeering
activity." This pattern must involve at least two predicate acts of
racketeering activity, which are listed in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1).
The Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company
established that a pattern of racketeering activity requires both

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
"relationship" and "continuity" among the predicate acts. Inc v.
Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106
L.Ed.2d 195 (1989). Additionally, secondary sources indicate that criminal
conduct forms a pattern if it involves criminal acts that have "the same or
similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or
otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not
isolated events." RECONCEIVING COERCION-BASED CRIMINAL
DEFENSES ("The Organized Crime Control Act (1970), which includes
RICO, provides that 'criminal conduct forms a pattern if it embraces criminal
acts that have the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or
methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing
characteristics and are not isolated events.'").
The coordinated actions of Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson appear to share
the same purpose, involve the same participants and victim, and use similar
methods. However, a full analysis of whether these actions constitute
predicate acts of racketeering activity under RICO would require additional
information about the specific crimes alleged.
Exceptions and Caveats
Enterprise vs. Pattern of Racketeering Activity
It is important to distinguish between the "enterprise" element and the
"pattern of racketeering activity" element of a RICO violation. As noted in 
United Energy Owners Committee, Inc. v. U.S. Energy Management
Systems, Inc., "a RICO enterprise must be 'an entity separate and apart from
the pattern of [racketeering] activity in which it engages.'" United Energy
Owners Committee, Inc. v. U.S. Energy Management Systems, Inc., 837 F.2d
356 (9th Cir. 1988) ("The Supreme Court held in United States v. Turkette,
452 U.S. 576, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981), that under section
1962(c) a RICO enterprise must be 'an entity separate and apart from the
pattern of [racketeering] activity in which it engages.' Id. at 583, 101 S.Ct.
at 2529.").
This means that the enterprise (Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson as an
association-in-fact) must exist beyond the specific alleged racketeering
activities. The facts suggest that these individuals had an ongoing
relationship and coordination that extended beyond individual acts, which
supports the finding of an enterprise separate from the pattern of
racketeering activity.
Enterprise vs. Ad Hoc Criminal Venture
Courts have emphasized that a RICO enterprise must be distinguished from
an ad hoc one-time criminal venture. U.S. v. Cianci, 378 F.3d 71 (1st Cir.
2004) ("In cases involving an alleged associated-in-fact RICO enterprise, the
existence of the charged enterprise does not follow, ipso facto, from
evidence that those named as the enterprise's associates engaged in crimes
that collectively may be characterized as a 'pattern of racketeering

=== PAGE 9 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
activity'... Something more must be found — something that distinguishes
RICO enterprises from ad hoc one-time criminal ventures...").
However, the facts indicate that Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson engaged in
ongoing collaboration with multiple coordinated actions toward a common
goal, rather than a one-time venture. Their activities involved preparation of
legal documents, interstate communications, service of eviction notices, and
finalizing divorce proceedings, suggesting a continuing relationship rather
than an ad hoc arrangement.
Conclusion
Based on the legal authorities provided, the coordinated actions of Myers,
Branthoover, and Wilson can constitute an "enterprise" under RICO. They
satisfy the three structural features required by the Supreme Court in Boyle
v. United States: (1) they shared a common purpose to unlawfully remove
the Plaintiff from his residence, gain an advantage in divorce proceedings,
and finalize the divorce; (2) they demonstrated relationships through their
collaboration on legal documents and coordinated actions; and (3) they
exhibited sufficient longevity through their ongoing collaboration to pursue
and achieve their purpose.
The absence of a formal legal structure among them does not preclude the
finding of an enterprise, as courts have consistently held that a RICO
enterprise requires only minimal structure and can include informal
associations of individuals. Additionally, their interstate communications and
use of the U.S. Mail Service satisfy RICO's jurisdictional requirement of
affecting interstate commerce.
While this analysis focuses on the "enterprise" element of a RICO violation,
it is important to note that establishing a complete RICO claim would also
require proving a "pattern of racketeering activity" involving specific
predicate acts defined in the statute. Nevertheless, the coordinated actions
of Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson, as described, align with the legal
definition and judicial interpretations of an "enterprise" under RICO.
The broad interpretation of "enterprise" under RICO, as established by the
Supreme Court and consistently applied by lower courts, supports the
conclusion that individuals who collaborate with a common purpose,
maintain relationships among themselves, and exhibit sufficient longevity to
pursue their objectives can constitute an association-in-fact enterprise, even
without a formal legal structure. This interpretation aligns with Congress's
intent to create a flexible tool to combat a wide range of coordinated
criminal activity, not limited to traditional notions of organized crime.

Extract
From the terms of RICO, it is apparent that an association-in-fact enterprise
must have at least three structural features: a purpose, relationships among
those associated with the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these
associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose. As we succinctly put it in
Turkette, an association-in-fact enterprise is 'a group of persons associated
together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct.' 452
U.S., at 583, 101 S.Ct. 2524.
Summary
The passage from Boyle v. United States clarifies that an "enterprise" under
RICO can be an informal association of individuals with a common purpose,
relationships among its members, and sufficient longevity to pursue its
objectives. This supports the proposition that Myers, Branthoover, and
Wilson's coordinated actions could constitute an "enterprise" under RICO, as
they allegedly worked together with a shared objective over time.

U.S. District Court — District of Maryland
Extract
RICO defines an 'enterprise' as 'any individual, partnership, corporation,
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4). See, e.g.,
Boyle, 556 U.S. at 944... Because 'an enterprise includes any union or group
of individuals associated in fact,' RICO extends to 'a group of persons
associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of
conduct.' Boyle, 556 U.S. at 944... Notably, 'an association-in-fact enterprise
must have at least three structural features: a purpose, relationships among
those associated with the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these
associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose.' Boyle, 556 U.S. at 946...
Summary
The definition of a RICO "enterprise" includes any group of individuals
associated in fact, even if not a legal entity, as long as they have a common
purpose, relationships among members, and sufficient longevity to pursue
their purpose. This aligns with the proposition that Myers, Branthoover, and
Wilson's coordinated actions could constitute a RICO enterprise.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Extract
Plaintiff asserts that the King Auto Group Defendants are all separately
incorporated businesses that associate together as 'King Auto Group,' as an
association-in-fact, although there is no formal, legal entity with that name.
These dealerships jointly market and sell vehicles and develop form
documents such as the Buyer's Orders used at each dealership. Plaintiff
asserts: Defendants have an agreement to work together to market and sell
used vehicles and actively are doing so. Defendants' cross-marketing and
commingling and/or sharing of inventory and Carfax reports is evidence of
their cooperation, joint agreements, and use of common procedures and
documents to unlawfully sell such used vehicles without the disclosure
required by Maryland law... A RICO enterprise is characterized by
'continuity, unity, shared purpose and identifiable structure.'
Summary
An association-in-fact enterprise under RICO does not require a formal legal
structure but is characterized by the association of its members for a
common purpose. The passage describes how separate entities can
collaborate and function as a unit to achieve a shared objective, which aligns
with the proposition that Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson collaborated to
achieve a common goal. The passage supports the idea that their
coordinated actions could constitute an enterprise under RICO.

Summary
Definition of an "enterprise" under RICO as a group of individuals associated
in fact with a common purpose, relationships among its members, and
sufficient longevity to pursue its purpose. The passage emphasizes that the
enterprise does not need to have formal structural attributes and can
include informal organizations. This supports the proposition that Myers,
Branthoover, and Wilson's coordinated actions could constitute an enterprise

U.S. Court of Appeals — Ninth Circuit
Extract
The enterprise is an entity, for present purposes a group of persons
associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of
conduct. The pattern of racketeering activity is, on the other hand, a series
of criminal acts as defined by the statute. The former is proved by evidence
of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by evidence that the
various associates function as a continuing unit.
Summary
The enterprise must be an ongoing organization where associates function
as a continuing unit. This supports the proposition that Myers, Branthoover,
and Wilson could be considered an enterprise under RICO if they
collaborated with a common purpose and functioned as a continuing unit.
Inc v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 492 U.S. 229, 109 S.Ct. 2893,
106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989)
U.S. Supreme Court
Extract
RICO's legislative history, however, establishes that Congress intended that
to prove a 'pattern of racketeering activity' a plaintiff or prosecutor must
show both 'relationship' and 'continuity'—that the racketeering predicates
are related, and that they either constitute or threaten long-term criminal
activity. ... Neither RICO's language nor its legislative history supports a rule
that a defendant's racketeering activities form a pattern only if they are
characteristic of organized crime. No such restriction appears in RICO's
text. ... Title 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) (1982 ed., Supp. V), with its very generous
definition of 'racketeering activity,' acknowledges the breakdown of the
traditional conception of organized crime, and responds to a new situation in
which persons engaged in long-term criminal activity often operate wholly

within legitimate enterprises. Congress drafted RICO broadly enough to
encompass a wide range of criminal activity, taking many different forms
and likely to attract a broad array of perpetrators operating in many
different ways.
Summary
RICO's application is not limited to traditional organized crime but can
include any group engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity, provided
there is a relationship and continuity in their actions. This supports the
proposition that Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson's coordinated actions could
constitute a RICO enterprise, as their activities were related and continuous,
aimed at achieving a common unlawful goal.
U.S. v. Cianci, 378 F.3d 71 (1st Cir. 2004)
U.S. Court of Appeals — First Circuit
Extract
In cases involving an alleged associated-in-fact RICO enterprise, the
existence of the charged enterprise does not follow, ipso facto, from
evidence that those named as the enterprise's associates engaged in crimes
that collectively may be characterized as a 'pattern of racketeering
activity'... Something more must be found — something that distinguishes
RICO enterprises from ad hoc one-time criminal ventures... A RICO
enterprise animated by an illicit common purpose can be comprised of an
association-in-fact of municipal entities and human members when the latter
exploits the former to carry out that purpose.
Summary
For a RICO enterprise to exist, there must be more than just a pattern of
racketeering activity; there must be an association-in-fact with a common
purpose. The passage supports the proposition by indicating that an
enterprise can be formed by individuals who exploit entities to carry out a
common illicit purpose. This aligns with the proposition that Myers,
Branthoover, and Wilson collaborated with a shared objective, thus
potentially forming a RICO enterprise.

Extract
The Supreme Court has not defined the outer boundaries of a RICO
enterprise, but has explained that 'an enterprise includes any union or group
of individuals associated in fact' and that RICO reaches 'a group of persons
associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of
conduct.' Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 944 (2009) (citing United
States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 580, 583 (1985)). This sort of enterprise
can be proven by 'evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal,
and by evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit.'
Turkette, 452 U.S. at 583. '[A]n association-in-fact enterprise must have at
least three structural features: a purpose, relationships among those
associated with the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these
associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose.' Boyle, 556 U.S. at 946.
Summary
The definition of an "enterprise" under RICO is broad and can include
informal associations of individuals who work together for a common
purpose. The passage cites Boyle v. United States, which is a key Supreme
Court case that clarifies the elements required to establish an "enterprise"
under RICO. This supports the proposition that Myers, Branthoover, and
Wilson's coordinated actions could be considered an "enterprise" under
RICO if they had a common purpose, relationships among them, and
sufficient longevity to pursue their objective.

Extract
The Supreme Court held in United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 101
S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981), that under section 1962(c) a RICO
enterprise must be 'an entity separate and apart from the pattern of
[racketeering] activity in which it engages.' Id. at 583, 101 S.Ct. at 2529.
The 'pattern of racketeering activity is ... a series of criminal acts,' while an
enterprise may be 'a group of persons associated together for a common
purpose of engaging in a course of conduct.' Id. ... There is no restriction
upon the associations embraced by the definition [of enterprise in section
1961(4) ]: an enterprise includes any ... group of individuals associated in
fact.
Summary
A RICO enterprise can be any group of individuals associated in fact, even if
it is not a formal legal entity, as long as it has a common purpose. The
passage supports the idea that Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson could be

considered an enterprise under RICO if they were associated together for a
common purpose, such as unlawfully removing the Plaintiff from his
residence and gaining an advantage in divorce proceedings.
Portionpac Chemical Corp. v. Sanitech Systems, 217 F.Supp.2d 1238 (M.D.
Fla. 2002)
U.S. District Court — Middle District of Florida
Extract
Congress designed the Federal Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO), Title 18, United States Code, Section 1961, et
seq. as a flexible tool to fight organized crime. As such, it makes the
following activities unlawful: (a) investing income derived, directly or
indirectly, from a pattern of racketeering activity through collection of an
unlawful debt in any enterprise which affects interstate commerce; (b)
acquiring or maintaining an interest in any enterprise which affects
interstate commerce through a pattern of racketeering activity or through
collection of an unlawful debt; (c) conducting or participating in the affairs
of any enterprise which affects interstate commerce through a pattern of
racketeering activity or collection of an unlawful debt; or (d) conspiring to
violate any of the provisions of Section 1962(a)-(c). 18 U.S.C. § 1962.
'Racketeering activities' covers a wide range of federal and state crimes,
including acts that are 'chargeable' under several generically described
state criminal laws, any act 'indictable' under numerous specific federal
criminal provisions, including mail and wire fraud, and any 'offense'
involving bankruptcy or securities fraud or drug-related activities that [are]
'punishable' under federal law. Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co. Inc., 473 U.S.
479, 482, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985) (quoting 18 U.S.C. §
1961(1)). To engage in a 'pattern of racketeering activity,' the defendant
must have participated in 'at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of
which occurred after the effective date of [RICO] and the last of which
occurred within ten years (excluding any term of imprisonment) after the
commission of a prior act of racketeering activity.' 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5).
Finally, 'enterprise' is defined under the statute as 'any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' Id. §
1961(c).
Summary
Detailed explanation of what constitutes an "enterprise" under RICO, which
includes any group of individuals associated in fact, even if not a legal entity.
It also explains the concept of "racketeering activities" and the requirement
for a "pattern of racketeering activity," which involves at least two acts. This
supports the proposition that Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson's coordinated
actions could be considered an "enterprise" under RICO if they engaged in
activities that meet these criteria.

United States v. Hosseini, 679 F.3d 544 (7th Cir. 2012)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Seventh Circuit
Extract
The RICO statute defines “enterprise” as including “any individual,
partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or
group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.” 18 U.S.C.
§ 1961(4) (emphasis added). The Supreme Court reads this definition quite
broadly. See Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 944–45, 129 S.Ct. 2237,
173 L.Ed.2d 1265 (2009). In Boyle the Court held that an “association-in-fact
enterprise” has just three elements: “a purpose,” “relationships among those
associated with the enterprise,” and “longevity sufficient to permit these
associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose.” Id. at 946, 129 S.Ct. 2237;
see also Jay E. Hayden Found. v. First Neighbor Bank, N.A., 610 F.3d 382,
389 (7th Cir.2010) (“[T]he alleged enterprise in this case had purpose and
relationships and it certainly had ‘longevity,’ and if Boyle is taken at face
value[,] nothing more is required to make a conspiracy a RICO enterprise.”).
Summary
The definition of a RICO "enterprise" is broad and includes any group of
individuals associated in fact, even if not a legal entity. The key elements are
a common purpose, relationships among members, and sufficient longevity
to pursue the purpose. The passage supports the proposition by illustrating
that the coordinated actions of Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson could be
seen as forming an "enterprise" under RICO, as they had a shared objective,
worked together, and maintained relationships to achieve their goal.
U.S. v. Olson, 450 F.3d 655 (7th Cir. 2006)
U.S. Court of Appeals — Seventh Circuit
Extract
The basic elements of a section 1962(c) violation are (1) conduct (2) of an
enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity. ... a RICO
enterprise is an ongoing structure of persons associated through time,
joined in purpose, and organized in a manner amenable to hierarchical or
consensual decision-making; ... continuity of structure exists where there is
an organizational pattern or system of authority that provides a mechanism
for directing the group.
Summary
A RICO enterprise requires conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity. The passage explains that a RICO enterprise is an

=== PAGE 17 ===

ongoing structure of persons associated through time, joined in purpose,
and organized in a manner amenable to hierarchical or consensual decision-
making. This supports the proposition that Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson's
coordinated actions could be considered an enterprise under RICO, as they
were associated in fact, had a common purpose, and demonstrated an
organizational pattern.
18 U.S.C. § 1962 18 U.S.C. § 1962 Prohibited Activities
Extract
It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of racketeering activity
or through collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or maintain, directly or
indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or
the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce. It shall be
unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise
engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce,
to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of
unlawful debt. It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any
of the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section.
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1962 outlines prohibited activities related to racketeering and
RICO violations. The statute makes it unlawful for individuals to engage in a
pattern of racketeering activity to acquire or maintain control of an
enterprise affecting interstate commerce. It also prohibits participation in
the conduct of an enterprise's affairs through racketeering and conspiring to
violate these provisions. This supports the proposition by providing a legal
basis for considering the coordinated actions of Myers, Branthoover, and
Wilson as part of a RICO enterprise, given their alleged pattern of unlawful
activities aimed at achieving a common goal.

Extract
According to the Supreme Court, an enterprise is either 'something acquired
through the use of illegal activities or by money obtained from illegal
activities,' or a 'vehicle through which the unlawful pattern of racketeering
activity is committed, rather than the victim of that activity.' Yet, [section]
1961(4) defines an enterprise as 'any individual, partnership, corporation,

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals
associated in fact although not a legal entity.' Therefore, labor unions,
business entities, and associations-in-fact all fall into the categorization of an
enterprise... the structure required of an enterprise must include 'a purpose,
relationship among those associated with the enterprise, and longevity
sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose.'
Because Congress included no structural requirements in the RICO statute,
the Court specifically noted that an enterprise need not have a hierarchy,
chain of command, fixed roles, or appear as a business-like entity. The Court
stated that an enterprise exists even if the group simply engages in sporadic
phases of activity followed by intervals of acquiescence, so long as it serves
as a 'continuing unit' and lasts long enough to engage in a 'course of
conduct.'
Summary
The definition of an "enterprise" under RICO is broad and includes any
group of individuals associated in fact, even if not a legal entity. The
Supreme Court has clarified that an enterprise must have a purpose,
relationships among its members, and sufficient longevity to pursue its
purpose. The passage supports the proposition by indicating that the
coordinated actions of Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson could be considered
an "enterprise" under RICO, as they had a common purpose and worked
together over time to achieve their objective.

Extract
The definition of 'enterprise' has a complicated judicial history. The
unadorned statutory text defines 'enterprise' as 'any individual, partnership,
corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' In United States v.
Turkette, the Court confronted the enterprise concept and held that an
enterprise included both legitimate, legally constituted entities, as well as
criminal groups that are not legally structured, but are nevertheless
associations-in-fact.
Summary
Judicial interpretation of the term "enterprise" under RICO, explaining that
it includes both legitimate entities and criminal groups that are not legally
structured but are associations-in-fact. This interpretation supports the
proposition that Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson's coordinated actions could
constitute an "enterprise" under RICO, as they were associated in fact to
achieve a common illegal goal.

Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
A violation of § 1962(c), the section on which Sedima relies, requires (1)
conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering
activity. The plaintiff must allege each of the elements to state a claim. They
are all equally essential components, and the complaint will fail if any one of
them is not adequately pleaded. In particular, RICO claims based on mail or
wire fraud must comport with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)’s
requirement that allegations involving fraud be pleaded with particularity.
The practitioner through their pleadings must articulate with great care and
attention a viable racketeering claim. In addition, § 1962(a), (b), and (c) are
limited in scope to conduct involving enterprises engaged in or the activities
of which affect interstate commerce. It is the activities of the enterprise, not
each predicate act, that must affect interstate or foreign commerce. RICO
requires no more than a slight effect upon interstate commerce. Even a
minimal effect on interstate commerce satisfies this jurisdictional
requirement.
Summary
Essential elements required to establish a RICO claim under § 1962(c),
which includes the conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of
racketeering activity. It emphasizes the need for the enterprise's activities to
affect interstate commerce, even minimally. This supports the proposition by
highlighting that the coordinated actions of Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson,
which involved interstate communication and use of the U.S. Mail Service,
could constitute an enterprise affecting interstate commerce under RICO.

RECONCEIVING COERCION-BASED CRIMINAL DEFENSES.
Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology - Northwestern University,
School of Law - Galoob, Stephen R. - 2022-03-22
Extract
The inquiry here is meant to invoke the 'pattern of racketeering activity'
element of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
The Organized Crime Control Act (1970), which includes RICO, provides that
'criminal conduct forms a pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics
and are not isolated events.' The Supreme Court characterized this
requirement as a 'relationship' element and held that the statute further
requires a 'continuity' element, 'referring either to a closed period of
repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the
future with a threat of repetition.'
Summary
The passage explains the elements required to establish a "pattern of
racketeering activity" under RICO, which includes criminal acts with similar
purposes, results, participants, or methods that are interrelated and not
isolated. It also emphasizes the need for a "relationship" and "continuity"
element, which can be demonstrated through repeated conduct or conduct
that threatens future repetition. This supports the proposition by
highlighting that the coordinated actions of Myers, Branthoover, and Wilson,
which were aimed at achieving a common unlawful goal, could be seen as
forming a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO.
