Question
Under what circumstances does judicial or quasi-judicial immunity not apply
to judges or court staff in Texas, particularly in the context of alleged RICO
predicate acts or document tampering?
Answer (Texas)
Short response
Judicial and quasi-judicial immunity in Texas does not apply when judges or
court staff act outside their judicial capacity or in the complete absence of
all jurisdiction, and immunity is also inapplicable to criminal conduct such
as document tampering or other acts that constitute willful violations of
penal statutes, including those that could serve as RICO predicate acts.
Thus, allegations of document tampering or similar criminal acts by judges
or court staff fall outside the protection of judicial immunity if the conduct is
nonjudicial or entirely beyond the court’s jurisdiction.
Summary
In Texas, judicial and quasi-judicial immunity is robust, shielding judges and
court staff from civil liability for actions taken in their official judicial
capacity and within their jurisdiction, even if those actions are erroneous,
malicious, or exceed their authority. However, this immunity is not absolute:
it does not protect actions that are nonjudicial in nature, taken in the
complete absence of all jurisdiction, or constitute criminal conduct such as
document tampering or other willful violations of penal statutes.
Specifically, Texas statutes and case law make clear that immunity does not
extend to criminal acts, including tampering with governmental records or
creating fraudulent court documents, and that judges may be subject to
removal, discipline, or prosecution for such conduct. In the context of
alleged RICO predicate acts or document tampering, if the conduct is not
part of a judicial function or is criminal in nature, immunity will not apply,
and both judges and court staff may face civil or criminal liability.
Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
Texas law provides a comprehensive framework for judicial and quasi-
judicial immunity, but also delineates clear exceptions, particularly for
criminal conduct:
Texas Penal Code § 37.10 (Tampering With Governmental
Record): This statute criminalizes knowingly making false entries,
altering, destroying, concealing, or impairing governmental records, as
• 

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
well as presenting or using false records with intent to defraud. The
statute applies to any person, including judges and court staff, and
explicitly provides for criminal liability for such acts, regardless of the
actor’s official status. Immunity does not shield individuals from
prosecution under this statute (Tex. Pen. Code § 37.10).
Texas Penal Code § 37.13 (Record of a Fraudulent Court): This
provision criminalizes the creation, presentation, or use of documents
purporting to be court records when the actor knows they are not
genuine and intends them to have legal effect. Again, this applies to all
persons, including judges and court staff, and immunity does not
protect against prosecution for such conduct (Tex. Pen. Code § 37.13).
Texas Constitution, Article 5, § 1-a: This constitutional provision
authorizes the removal, discipline, or suspension of judges for willful or
persistent violations of rules, incompetence, willful violation of the
Code of Judicial Conduct, or conduct that discredits the judiciary. It also
provides for suspension upon indictment for a felony or a misdemeanor
involving official misconduct, indicating that immunity does not protect
against criminal prosecution or disciplinary action for such acts (Tex.
Const. art. 5 § 1-a).
Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code § 101.053: This statute
generally provides immunity to courts and court staff for acts or
omissions performed in their official capacity or as part of a judicial
function, but does not address exceptions for criminal conduct,
suggesting that such claims fall outside the scope of this immunity (Tex.
Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 101.053).
Texas Government Code § 33.001 (Effective 9/1/2025): This
provision clarifies that willful or persistent conduct inconsistent with
judicial duties includes violations of penal statutes or the Code of
Judicial Conduct, further supporting the principle that immunity does
not extend to such conduct (Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.001).
Case Law
Texas courts have consistently articulated the boundaries of judicial and
quasi-judicial immunity:
General Rule: Judicial immunity protects judges from civil liability for
acts performed in their judicial capacity and within their jurisdiction,
even if those acts are erroneous, malicious, or exceed their authority
(Miller v. Plumlee, 05-21-00431-CV (Tex. App. Apr 08, 2022); Partain v.
Gabert, 13-21-00037-CV (Tex. App. Aug 26, 2021); West v. Robinson,
486 S.W.3d 669 (Tex. App. 2016); Twilligear v. Carrell, 148 S.W.3d 502
(Tex. App. 2004)).
Exceptions: Immunity is overcome in two circumstances: (1) when the
act is nonjudicial in nature (i.e., not taken in the judge’s official
capacity), or (2) when the act is taken in the complete absence of all
jurisdiction (Miller v. Plumlee, 05-21-00431-CV (Tex. App. Apr 08,

2022); Partain v. Gabert, 13-21-00037-CV (Tex. App. Aug 26, 2021); 
West v. Robinson, 486 S.W.3d 669 (Tex. App. 2016); James v.
Underwood, NO. 01-13-00277-CV (Tex. App. May 08, 2014)).
Application to Court Staff: Quasi-judicial immunity extends to court
staff and officers who act as arms of the court, provided they perform
functions intimately associated with the judicial process and act in good
faith within the scope of their authority (Delcourt v. Silverman, 919 S.W.
2d 777 (Tex. App. 1996); Alcorn v. Vaksman, 877 S.W.2d 390 (Tex. App.
1994); GAB Business Services, Inc. v. Moore, 829 S.W.2d 345 (Tex. App.
1992)).
Administrative and Nonjudicial Acts: Immunity does not apply to
nonjudicial, administrative acts, such as employment decisions or other
functions not directly related to adjudication (B.K. v. Cox, 116 S.W.3d
351 (Tex. App. 2003); Guerrero v. Refugio County, 946 S.W.2d 558 (Tex.
App. 1997), but note this case was overruled by Perry v. Del Rio, 53
S.W.3d 818 (Tex. App. 2001), which limits its authority).
Criminal Conduct: Texas courts and statutes make clear that
immunity does not shield judges or court staff from criminal
prosecution for acts such as document tampering or other willful
violations of penal statutes (Tex. Pen. Code § 37.10; Tex. Pen. Code §
37.13; Tex. Const. art. 5 § 1-a).
Analysis
Judicial and Quasi-Judicial Immunity: Scope and Rationale
Judicial immunity in Texas is designed to protect the independence and
integrity of the judiciary by shielding judges from civil liability for acts
performed in their judicial capacity and within their jurisdiction. This
protection extends to quasi-judicial officers and court staff when they
perform functions intimately associated with the judicial process and act in
good faith within the scope of their authority (Delcourt v. Silverman, 919
S.W.2d 777 (Tex. App. 1996); Alcorn v. Vaksman, 877 S.W.2d 390 (Tex. App.
1994)).
The rationale is to allow judges and court staff to perform their duties
without fear of personal liability, even if their decisions are unpopular,
erroneous, or made in bad faith (Miller v. Plumlee, 05-21-00431-CV (Tex.
App. Apr 08, 2022); Partain v. Gabert, 13-21-00037-CV (Tex. App. Aug 26,
2021)). This immunity is not, however, a license for criminal or nonjudicial
conduct.

Exceptions to Immunity: Nonjudicial Acts and Absence of
Jurisdiction
The Texas courts have consistently held that judicial immunity is not
absolute. There are two well-established exceptions:
Nonjudicial Acts: If a judge or court staff member engages in conduct
that is not part of their judicial or quasi-judicial functions—such as
administrative decisions unrelated to adjudication, or personal conduct
outside the scope of their office—immunity does not apply (Walker v.
Hartman, 516 S.W.3d 71 (Tex. App. 2017); B.K. v. Cox, 116 S.W.3d 351
(Tex. App. 2003); Guerrero v. Refugio County, 946 S.W.2d 558 (Tex. App.
1997), but see subsequent overruling).
Complete Absence of Jurisdiction: If the act is performed in the
complete absence of all jurisdiction—meaning the judge or staff
member had no legal authority to act in the matter—immunity is not
available (West v. Robinson, 486 S.W.3d 669 (Tex. App. 2016); James v.
Underwood, NO. 01-13-00277-CV (Tex. App. May 08, 2014); City of
Houston v. West Capital Financial Services Corp., 961 S.W.2d 687 (Tex.
App. 1998)).
The courts have clarified that even if a judge acts in error, with malice, or in
excess of authority, immunity generally applies as long as the act is judicial
in nature and within some subject-matter jurisdiction (Feist v. Gist, NO.
09-18-00255-CV (Tex. App. Oct 24, 2019); James v. Underwood, NO.
01-13-00277-CV (Tex. App. May 08, 2014)).
Criminal Conduct: Document Tampering and RICO
Predicate Acts
Texas law is explicit that judicial and quasi-judicial immunity does not
protect against criminal liability. Statutes such as Texas Penal Code § 37.10
and § 37.13 criminalize tampering with governmental records and the
creation or use of fraudulent court documents, respectively. These statutes
apply to all persons, including judges and court staff, and make no exception
for official status (Tex. Pen. Code § 37.10; Tex. Pen. Code § 37.13).
If a judge or court staff member knowingly falsifies, alters, destroys, or
conceals a governmental record, or creates a fraudulent court document
with intent to give it legal effect, they are subject to criminal prosecution.
Judicial immunity does not shield against such prosecution, nor does it
prevent removal, discipline, or suspension for such conduct (Tex. Const. art.
5 § 1-a; Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.001).
In the context of alleged RICO predicate acts, such as obstruction of justice,
bribery, or document tampering, the same principles apply. If the conduct is
criminal in nature and not part of a legitimate judicial function, immunity is
unavailable. The Texas Constitution and statutes provide mechanisms for
removal, discipline, and prosecution of judges for willful violations of penal
statutes or conduct that discredits the judiciary (Tex. Const. art. 5 § 1-a; Tex.
Gov't. Code § 33.001).

Application to Court Staff and Quasi-Judicial Officers
Quasi-judicial immunity extends to court staff and officers who act as arms
of the court, provided they perform functions intimately associated with the
judicial process and act in good faith within the scope of their authority
(Delcourt v. Silverman, 919 S.W.2d 777 (Tex. App. 1996); Alcorn v. Vaksman,
877 S.W.2d 390 (Tex. App. 1994)). However, if court staff engage in criminal
conduct, act outside the scope of their official duties, or act in bad faith,
immunity does not apply (GAB Business Services, Inc. v. Moore, 829 S.W.2d
345 (Tex. App. 1992)).
The Texas Supreme Court has also recognized that failure by a judge to
supervise court staff can constitute judicial misconduct, particularly if it
results in violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct or criminal statutes (In
re Rose, 144 S.W.3d 661 (Tex. 2004)).
Civil vs. Criminal Liability
While judicial immunity is primarily a defense to civil liability, it does not bar
criminal prosecution. Texas statutes and constitutional provisions make
clear that judges and court staff are subject to criminal prosecution for
violations of penal statutes, including those involving document tampering
or fraudulent court records (Tex. Pen. Code § 37.10; Tex. Pen. Code § 37.13; 
Tex. Const. art. 5 § 1-a).
Additionally, judicial immunity does not bar prospective injunctive relief
against a judicial officer acting in a judicial capacity (Twilligear v. Carrell,
148 S.W.3d 502 (Tex. App. 2004)).
Exceptions and Caveats
Good Faith Requirement for Quasi-Judicial Immunity: For court
staff and quasi-judicial officers, immunity requires that the individual
act in good faith, within the scope of their authority, and perform
discretionary functions. If any of these elements are lacking, immunity
does not apply (Alcorn v. Vaksman, 877 S.W.2d 390 (Tex. App. 1994); 
GAB Business Services, Inc. v. Moore, 829 S.W.2d 345 (Tex. App.
1992)).
Administrative Acts: Immunity does not extend to nonjudicial,
administrative acts, such as employment decisions, as clarified by the
U.S. Supreme Court in Forrester v. White and adopted by Texas courts
(B.K. v. Cox, 116 S.W.3d 351 (Tex. App. 2003); Guerrero v. Refugio
County, 946 S.W.2d 558 (Tex. App. 1997), but see subsequent
overruling).
Subsequent Negative Treatment: The case Guerrero v. Refugio
County, 946 S.W.2d 558 (Tex. App. 1997) was overruled by Perry v. Del
Rio, 53 S.W.3d 818 (Tex. App. 2001) to the extent it conflicted with the
latter’s interpretation of the scope of judicial immunity in civil rights
•

contexts. This limits the authority of Guerrero, but the general principle
that immunity does not apply to nonjudicial acts remains valid.
Derived Immunity for Court Staff: The functional approach adopted
by Texas courts means that court staff may be entitled to immunity if
their conduct is intimately associated with the judicial process and
discretionary in nature (Jones v. Sherry, NO. 03-18-00279-CV (Tex. App.
Jun 28, 2019)).
Conclusion
Judicial and quasi-judicial immunity in Texas is broad but not absolute. It
protects judges and court staff from civil liability for actions taken in their
judicial capacity and within their jurisdiction, even if those actions are
erroneous or malicious. However, immunity does not apply to nonjudicial
acts, actions taken in the complete absence of jurisdiction, or criminal
conduct such as document tampering or other willful violations of penal
statutes. Texas statutes and constitutional provisions make clear that judges
and court staff are subject to criminal prosecution and disciplinary action for
such conduct, and immunity does not shield them from liability in these
circumstances. In the context of alleged RICO predicate acts or document
tampering, if the conduct is not part of a legitimate judicial function or is
criminal in nature, immunity will not apply, and both judges and court staff
may face civil or criminal liability.
Legal Authorities
B.K. v. Cox, 116 S.W.3d 351 (Tex. App. 2003)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Some cases using the functional approach have held that certain
administrative functions of judges are not part of the judicial function and
therefore are outside the scope of judicial immunity. See, e.g., Forrester v.
White, 484 U.S. 219, 108 S.Ct. 538, 98 L.Ed.2d 555 (1988) (holding judge
not able to invoke judicial immunity in § 1983 damages action against him
for employment decision made in the exercise of his administrative
functions). However, the case before us today does not involve nonjudicial,
administrative functions, and cases such as Forrester only reinforce the
principle that judges or those whom they appoint are entitled to absolute
immunity for alleged acts and omissions during the performance of functions
intimately associated with the judicial process.
Summary
Judicial immunity does not apply to nonjudicial, administrative functions of
judges. This suggests that if a judge or court staff were involved in actions
that are administrative rather than judicial, such as employment decisions,
•

they might not be protected by judicial immunity. This is relevant to
understanding the limits of judicial immunity in Texas.
James v. Underwood, NO. 01-13-00277-CV (Tex. App. May 08, 2014)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Having concluded that the judges' acts were judicial in nature, we next
consider whether the judges acted in a 'complete absence of all jurisdiction.'
Mireles, 502 U.S. at 12, 112 S. Ct. at 288; Bradt, 892 S.W.2d at 68. To
overcome judicial immunity, the act must be either nonjudicial, as discussed
above, or have occurred in a complete absence of all jurisdiction. Bradt, 892
S.W.2d at 67. In Bradt, a litigant sued a state district judge, arguing that
judicial immunity did not attach because there was a recusal motion pending
against the judge at the time. This court rejected the argument, noting that
the term 'jurisdiction' has a different meaning in the judicial-immunity
context. Id. at 67-68. 'Where a court has some subject-matter jurisdiction,
there is sufficient jurisdiction for immunity purposes.'
Summary
Even if there is some subject-matter jurisdiction, judicial immunity is likely
to apply. This suggests that for judicial immunity not to apply, the actions
must be entirely outside the scope of judicial duties or without any
jurisdictional basis.
Walker v. Hartman, 516 S.W.3d 71 (Tex. App. 2017)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Hartman pleaded that Walker's tortious misconduct stemmed from 'non-
judicial actions outside the scope of his jurisdiction as a judge[ ]' and that
'Walker's misconduct was not based on his adjudication of any case lawfully
assigned to his court.' ... Although we agree that Walker is entitled to
judicial immunity for ordering Hartman's arrest when a disturbance
(regardless of the cause of the disturbance) involving Hartman occurred in
Walker's courtroom while Walker was presiding, we do not agree that
Walker's alleged actions subsequent to Hartman's arrest are protected by
judicial immunity. ... As we concluded above, with the exception of ordering
Hartman arrested in the courtroom, Walker was not acting in his official
capacity when he allegedly committed the acts complained of by Hartman in
his pleadings and affidavits. As such, Walker is not entitled to quasi-judicial
immunity for the acts which Hartman asserts constitute malicious
prosecution and civil conspiracy.

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
Judicial and quasi-judicial immunity do not apply to actions taken by a judge
that are outside the scope of their judicial duties. In this case, the court
found that Walker's actions, apart from ordering an arrest in the courtroom,
were not protected by immunity because they were not part of his official
judicial functions. This suggests that if a judge's actions are not related to
their role in adjudicating cases, such as engaging in a civil conspiracy or
malicious prosecution, they may not be protected by immunity.
Spease v. Olivares, 509 S.W.3d 512 (Tex. App. 2016)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
We reject this theory because Judge Olivares was dismissed from the lawsuit
because of judicial immunity and not sovereign immunity. Thus an exception
to sovereign immunity, even were it properly pled, would not apply. And
were it otherwise, every judge who ever entered an adverse judgment
against a party would be subject to a takings claim, because most judgments
divest a person of either property or liberty. Accordingly, we overrule Issue
Four. In Issue Five, Appellants maintain that immunity was waived because
Judge Olivares traveled to hearings in Hudspeth County in a motor vehicle
and the Texas Tort Claims Act waives immunity for property damage which
&#34;arises from the operation or use of a motor-driven vehicle.&#34;
TEX.CIV.PRAC. &amp; REM.CODE ANN. § 101.021 (West 2011). We reject
this theory for a number of reasons. First, it was never raised in
Appellants&#39; Petition, and our sole focus is on whether the last active
pleading asserts a claim which is not barred by judicial immunity. Second,
Judge Olivares was dismissed on judicial immunity and not sovereign
immunity grounds. We are aware of no authority that the Texas Tort Claims
Act operates as an exception to judicial immunity. Finally, even if the Tort
Claims Act was applicable, the mere fact Judge Olivares drove to court in a
motor vehicle does not operate as a general waiver of immunity.
Summary
Judicial immunity in Texas is distinct from sovereign immunity, and
exceptions to sovereign immunity do not apply to judicial immunity. The
passage also clarifies that the Texas Tort Claims Act does not provide an
exception to judicial immunity, even if a judge uses a motor vehicle in the
course of their duties. This indicates that judicial immunity is robust and not
easily waived by actions that might otherwise fall under exceptions to
sovereign immunity.

Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Quasi-judicial immunity protects public officials when they (1) act within the
course and scope of their office, (2) perform discretionary functions, and (3)
act in good faith. Perry, 737 S.W.2d at 110; Anderson v. Higdon, 695 S.W.2d
320, 324 (Tex.App.--Waco 1985, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Quasi-judicial immunity is
an affirmative defense. Perry, 737 S.W.2d at 110; Austin v. Hale, 711 S.W.2d
64, 66 (Tex.App.--Waco 1986, no writ). Therefore, the official must plead and
prove all of its elements.
Summary
Quasi-judicial immunity in Texas applies to public officials when they act
within the course and scope of their office, perform discretionary functions,
and act in good faith. This immunity is an affirmative defense, meaning the
official must plead and prove all its elements. If any of these elements are
not met, quasi-judicial immunity may not apply. The passage does not
specifically address RICO predicate acts or document tampering, but it
provides a general framework for when quasi-judicial immunity might not
apply.
In re Rose, 144 S.W.3d 661 (Tex. 2004)
Texas Supreme Court
Extract
Accordingly, there is no doubt that the failure to supervise, or the under-
supervision of, court staff can constitute judicial misconduct. See generally
SHAMAN ET AL., JUDICIAL CONDUCT AND ETHICS § 6.10. Texas Code of
Judicial Conduct Canon 3(C) expressly provides that in a judge's discharge
of his or her administrative responsibilities, '[a] judge should require staff,
court officials and others subject to the judge's direction and control to
observe the standards of fidelity and diligence that apply to the judge....'
TEX.CODE JUD. CONDUCT, Canon 3(C)(2). In defining 'require' in that
context, the Code notes that 'a judge is to exercise reasonable direction and
control over the conduct of those persons subject to the judge's direction
and control.' Id., Canon 8(B)(11).
Summary
The passage highlights that judicial misconduct can occur if a judge fails to
properly supervise court staff. This suggests that judicial immunity might
not apply in cases where a judge's failure to supervise leads to misconduct,
such as document tampering. The Texas Code of Judicial Conduct requires
judges to ensure that their staff adhere to standards of fidelity and diligence,
implying that failure to do so could result in liability.

City of Houston v. West Capital Financial Services Corp., 961 S.W.2d 687
(Tex. App. 1998)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Judges enjoy absolute judicial immunity from liability for judicial acts, no
matter how erroneous the act or how evil the motive, unless the act is
performed in the clear absence of all jurisdiction. Turner v. Pruitt, 161 Tex.
532, 342 S.W.2d 422, 423 (1961); Delcourt v. Silverman, 919 S.W.2d 777,
781 (Tex.App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1996, writ denied).
Summary
Judges in Texas have absolute judicial immunity for judicial acts, regardless
of the act's correctness or the judge's motive. However, this immunity does
not apply if the act is performed in the clear absence of all jurisdiction. This
means that if a judge acts outside their jurisdiction, they may not be
protected by judicial immunity. The passage does not specifically address
RICO predicate acts or document tampering, but it provides a general
principle regarding the limits of judicial immunity.
Miller v. Plumlee, 05-21-00431-CV (Tex. App. Apr 08, 2022)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Judicial immunity applies unless the plaintiff can show: (1) the claim is based
on some act not taken in the judge's judicial capacity or (2) the judge's
actions were taken in the complete absence of all jurisdiction. Mireles v.
Waco, 502 U.S. 9, 10-12 (1991). It is an immunity from suit, not just from the
assessment of damages. Mireles, 502 U.S. at 11; Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at
224. Further, '[t]his immunity extends to actions that are done in error,
maliciously, and even in excess of the judge's authority.' Twilligear v. Carrell,
148 S.W.3d 502, 504 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2004, pet. denied).
Summary
The passage from "Miller v. Plumlee" provides a clear explanation of the
circumstances under which judicial immunity does not apply in Texas. It
states that judicial immunity is not applicable if the plaintiff can
demonstrate that the judge's actions were not taken in their judicial capacity
or were taken in the complete absence of all jurisdiction. This immunity is
comprehensive, covering actions done in error, maliciously, or even in excess
of authority. The scope of this material is broad, as it applies to any case

Plumlee.
Partain v. Gabert, 13-21-00037-CV (Tex. App. Aug 26, 2021)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
There are only two circumstances when judicial immunity can be overcome:
(1) when the judge's actions were non-judicial in nature or (2) when the
actions were taken in the complete absence of all jurisdiction. See Mireles v.
Waco, 502 U.S. 9, 11 (1991).
Summary
Clear explanation of the two exceptions to judicial immunity: actions that
are non-judicial in nature and actions taken in the complete absence of
jurisdiction. This is relevant to understanding when judicial immunity might
not apply, even in cases involving serious allegations such as RICO predicate
acts or document tampering. The context of the passage is a legal judgment,
which lends it authority and general applicability within Texas.
Deyo v. Bradshaw, 14-19-00792-CV (Tex. App. Aug 05, 2021)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Judges acting in their official judicial capacity have immunity from liability
and suit for judicial acts performed within the scope of their jurisdiction. ...
Judicial immunity is overcome only for actions that are: (1) nonjudicial, i.e.,
not taken in the judge's official capacity, or (2) taken in the complete
absence of all jurisdiction.
Summary
Judicial immunity in Texas protects judges from liability for actions taken in
their official capacity, even if those actions are erroneous or exceed their
authority. However, this immunity does not apply if the actions are
nonjudicial or taken in the complete absence of jurisdiction. The passage
does not specifically address RICO predicate acts or document tampering,
but it provides a general framework for when judicial immunity might not
apply.
West v. Robinson, 486 S.W.3d 669 (Tex. App. 2016)

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A judge's judicial immunity can be overcome in only two instances: first,
where the complained-of actions were non-judicial; and second, where the
complained-of actions, though judicial in nature, were 'taken in the complete
absence of all jurisdiction.'
Summary
Judicial immunity in Texas is generally absolute, protecting judges from suits
for actions taken in their judicial capacity. However, there are two
exceptions to this immunity: (1) if the actions were non-judicial, meaning
they were not part of the judge's official duties, and (2) if the actions were
taken in the complete absence of all jurisdiction, meaning the judge had no
legal authority to act in the matter. These exceptions are applicable
regardless of the nature of the alleged misconduct, including RICO
predicate acts or document tampering.
Halsey v. Dallas County, Texas, 68 S.W.3d 81 (Tex. App. 2001)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
It is well established that judges are absolutely immune from liability for
judicial acts that are not performed in the clear absence of all jurisdiction,
no matter how erroneous the act or how evil the motive. ... Officers of the
court who are integral parts of the judicial process, such as court clerks, law
clerks, bailiffs, constables issuing writs, and court-appointed receivers and
trustees, are entitled to judicial immunity if they actually function as an arm
of the court.
Summary
Judges and court staff are generally protected by judicial immunity for acts
performed within their jurisdiction and as part of their official duties. This
immunity applies even if the acts are erroneous or motivated by malice, as
long as they are not performed in the clear absence of all jurisdiction. The
passage also explains that this immunity extends to court staff who function
as an arm of the court, under the concept of "derived judicial immunity."
However, the passage does not specifically address exceptions related to
RICO predicate acts or document tampering.

In Texas, courts apply a 'functional approach' to determine whether a person
is entitled to derived judicial immunity. Halsey, 87 S.W.3d at 554 (discussing
Delcourt, 919 S.W.2d at 782-83). This approach focuses on the nature of the
function performed, not the identity of the actor, and considers whether the
court officer's conduct is like that of the delegating or appointing judge. Id.
at 555. Under this functional approach, courts must assess 'whether the
person seeking immunity is intimately associated with the judicial process'
and whether 'that person exercises discretionary judgment comparable to
that of the judge.' Id. at 554. When an individual acquires derived judicial
immunity from a particular function, absolute immunity extends to 'every
action taken with regard to that function—whether good or bad, honest or
dishonest, well-intentioned or not.'
Summary
Derived judicial immunity can extend to actions taken in the performance of
judicial functions, regardless of the nature of those actions (good, bad,
honest, dishonest, etc.). This suggests that even in cases of alleged RICO
predicate acts or document tampering, if the actions are within the scope of
judicial functions, immunity may still apply.
Guerrero v. Refugio County, 946 S.W.2d 558 (Tex. App. 1997)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Judges enjoy absolute immunity from damage claims arising out of acts
performed in the exercise of their judicial functions even if acting in bad
faith or with malice... However, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that in civil
rights cases, absolute judicial immunity applies only when a judge acts in a
judicial capacity. Forrester v. White, 484 U.S. 219, 228-30, 108 S.Ct. 538,
544-46, 98 L.Ed.2d 555 (1988). In Forrester, the Court held that the
termination of a probation officer by a judge was an administrative act, and
not a judicial act. Id. Because Judges Lewis, Kilgore, and Kelly were not
acting in a judicial capacity, we conclude that they cannot assert the
affirmative defense of absolute judicial immunity against Guerrero's § 1983
claim for political discrimination.
Summary
Judicial immunity in Texas does not apply when judges are not acting in a
judicial capacity. The U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Forrester v. White is
cited, which distinguishes between judicial acts and administrative acts,
with immunity applying only to the former. This is relevant to understanding
when judicial immunity might not protect judges, especially in civil rights
cases. The passage does not specifically address RICO predicate acts or

document tampering, but it provides a framework for understanding when
judicial immunity might not apply.
Feist v. Gist, NO. 09-18-00255-CV (Tex. App. Oct 24, 2019)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
A judge has immunity when acting in the course of a judicial proceeding
over which he has jurisdiction. ... 'A judge will not be deprived of immunity
because he was in error, took action maliciously[,] or was in excess of his
authority; rather he will be subject to liability only when he has acted in the
clear absence of all jurisdiction.'
Summary
The passage from "Feist v. Gist" provides insight into the circumstances
under which judicial immunity does not apply. It states that judges have
immunity when acting within their jurisdiction, even if they make errors or
act maliciously. However, they can be subject to liability if they act in the
clear absence of all jurisdiction. This implies that judicial immunity does not
protect judges if they perform acts that are completely outside their
jurisdictional authority.
Walker v. Hartman, NO. 09-19-00061-CV (Tex. App. Mar 26, 2020)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
An individual employee may be entitled to governmental immunity if he is
sued in his official capacity. Nueces Cty. v. Ferguson, 97 S.W.3d 205, 214
(Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2002, no pet.). 'Persons sued in their official
capacity may raise any defense available to the governmental unit, including
sovereign immunity' although this immunity does not apply to a person sued
in their individual capacity and '[p]ersons sued in their individual
capacities,... may not rely on sovereign immunity protections for claims
against them in that capacity, although they may assert the defense of
official immunity.' Id. at 215 (citations omitted). '[P]ersons sued in both
official and individual capacities may assert both official and sovereign
immunity, although they enjoy sovereign immunity protection only to the
extent that they were acting in their official capacity.' Id.
Summary
Governmental immunity can protect individuals sued in their official
capacity, but not in their individual capacity. In individual capacity suits,

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
they may assert official immunity, which is an affirmative defense. This
distinction is crucial in understanding when judicial or quasi-judicial
immunity might not apply, particularly if the actions in question fall outside
the scope of their official duties or involve personal liability.
Hartman v. Estate of Alford, NO. 09-19-00051-CV (Tex. App. Sep 19, 2019)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Hartman argues in his brief that because this Court held before that Walker
was not acting within the course and scope of his employment as a district
judge when he ordered Hartman arrested, 'it necessarily follows all other
participants in this conspiracy who were government employees, could not
have been acting within the normal course and scope of their employment,
within the meaning of TTCA §§ 101.001(5)... and 101.106(f).' We disagree. In
Walker v. Hartman, this Court explained that '[a] judge has immunity when
acting in the course of a judicial proceeding over which he has jurisdiction.'
516 S.W.3d at 82 (citation omitted). We determined that when Walker
arrested Hartman for disrupting his courtroom, his actions were covered by
judicial immunity. See id. The actions he took after arresting Hartman,
however, were not covered. See id.
Summary
Judicial immunity applies to actions taken by judges within the course of a
judicial proceeding over which they have jurisdiction. However, actions
taken outside of this scope, such as those not related to the judicial
proceeding or beyond the judge's jurisdiction, may not be covered by judicial
immunity. This suggests that if a judge or court staff engages in actions that
are not part of their judicial duties or outside their jurisdiction, such as
document tampering or participating in a conspiracy, they may not be
protected by judicial immunity.
Hartman v. Barker, NO. 09-19-00052-CV (Tex. App. Feb 20, 2020)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Prosecutors enjoy absolute immunity under common law. Imbler v.
Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409, 427 (1976). 'Texas courts have followed federal
courts and consistently held as a matter of law that absolute immunity
extends to quasi-judicial officers, including prosecutors performing such
typical prosecutorial functions as initiating criminal prosecution and
presenting the State's case.' Brown v. Lubbock Cty. Comm. Ct., 185 S.W.3d
499, 505 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2005, no pet.) (citing Oden v. Reader, 935 S.W.

=== PAGE 16 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
2d 470, 474-75 (Tex. App.—Tyler 1996, no pet.)). 'Activities intimately
associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process, such as initiating
a prosecution and presenting the State's case, are functions to which
absolute immunity applies with full force.'
Summary
In Texas, absolute immunity is extended to quasi-judicial officers, including
prosecutors, for actions intimately associated with the judicial phase of the
criminal process. This immunity is absolute and applies even in cases of
alleged malicious or dishonest actions. The passage does not specifically
address exceptions to this immunity in the context of RICO predicate acts or
document tampering, suggesting that such exceptions are not recognized
under the current legal framework.
Twilligear v. Carrell, 148 S.W.3d 502 (Tex. App. 2004)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
Judges acting in their official judicial capacity have immunity from liability
and suit for judicial acts performed within the scope of their jurisdiction. ...
It is overcome only for actions that are: (1) nonjudicial, i.e., not taken in the
judge's official capacity; or (2) taken in the complete absence of all
jurisdiction. ... However, judicial immunity is not a bar to prospective
injunctive relief against a judicial officer acting in a judicial capacity or to
attorney's fees for obtaining such relief.
Summary
The passage from Twilligear v. Carrell outlines the circumstances under
which judicial immunity does not apply. Specifically, it states that judicial
immunity is overcome for actions that are nonjudicial or taken in the
complete absence of all jurisdiction. Additionally, it clarifies that judicial
immunity does not prevent prospective injunctive relief against a judicial
officer. This information is generally applicable to cases involving judicial
immunity in Texas, providing a clear framework for when such immunity
might not apply.
Delcourt v. Silverman, 919 S.W.2d 777 (Tex. App. 1996)
Texas Court of Appeals
Extract
It is well-established that judges are absolutely immune from liability for
judicial acts that are not performed in the clear absence of all jurisdiction,

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
no matter how erroneous the act or how evil the motive. ... When judges
delegate their authority or appoint others to perform services for the court,
the judicial immunity that attaches to the judge may follow the delegation or
appointment. ... Officers of the court who are integral parts of the judicial
process, such as court clerks, law clerks, bailiffs, constables issuing writs,
and court-appointed receivers and trustees are entitled to judicial immunity
if they actually function as an arm of the court.
Summary
The passage from Delcourt v. Silverman establishes that judges in Texas are
granted absolute immunity for judicial acts unless those acts are performed
in the clear absence of all jurisdiction. This immunity extends to court staff
and officers who are integral to the judicial process, provided they function
as an arm of the court. The passage does not specifically address RICO
predicate acts or document tampering, but it implies that immunity would
not apply if the acts were outside the scope of judicial functions or
jurisdiction.
Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 101.053 Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code §
101.053 Judicial
Extract
This chapter does not apply to a claim based on an act or omission of a court
of this state or any member of a court of this state acting in his official
capacity or to a judicial function of a governmental unit. 'Official capacity'
means all duties of office and includes administrative decisions or actions.
This chapter does not apply to a claim based on an act or omission of an
employee in the execution of a lawful order of any court.
Summary
The statute provides immunity to courts and court staff for acts or omissions
performed in their official capacity or as part of a judicial function. This
includes administrative decisions and actions, as well as the execution of
lawful court orders. The statute does not specifically address exceptions to
this immunity in the context of RICO predicate acts or document tampering,
suggesting that such claims would not fall under the general tort claims
covered by this chapter.
Tex. Pen. Code § 37.10 Tex. Pen. Code § 37.10 Tampering With
Governmental Record
Extract
A person commits an offense if he: knowingly makes a false entry in, or false
alteration of, a governmental record; makes, presents, or uses any record,

=== PAGE 18 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
document, or thing with knowledge of its falsity and with intent that it be
taken as a genuine governmental record; intentionally destroys, conceals,
removes, or otherwise impairs the verity, legibility, or availability of a
governmental record; possesses, sells, or offers to sell a governmental
record or a blank governmental record form with intent that it be used
unlawfully; makes, presents, or uses a governmental record with knowledge
of its falsity; or possesses, sells, or offers to sell a governmental record or a
blank governmental record form with knowledge that it was obtained
unlawfully.
Summary
The Texas Penal Code § 37.10 outlines offenses related to tampering with
governmental records. This statute applies to any person, including judges
or court staff, who knowingly makes false entries, alters, destroys, or
otherwise impairs governmental records. Judicial or quasi-judicial immunity
typically protects judges and court staff from liability for actions taken in
their official capacity. However, this immunity does not extend to criminal
acts such as document tampering. Therefore, if a judge or court staff
member engages in such conduct, they may be subject to prosecution under
this statute, and immunity would not apply.
Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.001 Tex. Gov't. Code § 33.001 [Effective 9/1/2025]
Definitions
Extract
For purposes of Section 1-a, Article V, Texas Constitution, 'wilful or
persistent conduct that is clearly inconsistent with the proper performance
of a judge's duties' includes: wilful violation of a provision of the Texas penal
statutes or the Code of Judicial Conduct; persistent or wilful violation of the
rules promulgated by the supreme court; incompetence in the performance
of the duties of the office; failure to cooperate with the commission; violation
of any provision of a voluntary agreement to resign from judicial office in
lieu of disciplinary action by the commission; persistent or wilful violation of
Article Code of Criminal Procedure 17.15, Code of Criminal Procedure; or
persistent or wilful violation of Section 22.302(a).
Summary
Judicial or quasi-judicial immunity may not apply in cases where a judge
engages in willful or persistent conduct that is inconsistent with their duties.
This includes violations of penal statutes, the Code of Judicial Conduct, or
rules set by the supreme court. Such conduct could potentially include
actions that might be considered RICO predicate acts or document
tampering if they violate these provisions.

Tex. Hum. Res. Code § 152.2264 Tex. Hum. Res. Code § 152.2264 Tarrant
County Criminal Court Administrator
Extract
A judge may not be subjected to a suit for, and is immune from liability for
damages arising from, an act or omission committed while performing a
duty under this section unless the act or omission is: committed
intentionally, wilfully, or wantonly; or committed with: (A) gross negligence;
(B) conscious indifference for the safety of others; or (C) reckless disregard
for the safety of others.
Summary
Judicial immunity in this context does not apply if the judge's act or omission
was committed intentionally, willfully, wantonly, or with gross negligence,
conscious indifference, or reckless disregard for the safety of others. This
indicates that in Tarrant County, Texas, judges may lose their immunity
under these specific circumstances.
Tex. Const. art. 5 § 1-a Tex. Const. art. 5 § 1-a Retirement, Censure,
Removal, and Compensation of Justices and Judges; State Commission On
Judicial Conduct; Procedure
Extract
Any Justice or Judge of the courts established by this Constitution or created
by the Legislature as provided in Section 1, Article V, of this Constitution,
may, subject to the other provisions hereof, be removed from office for
willful or persistent violation of rules promulgated by the Supreme Court of
Texas, incompetence in performing the duties of the office, willful violation
of the Code of Judicial Conduct, or willful or persistent conduct that is
clearly inconsistent with the proper performance of his duties or casts public
discredit upon the judiciary or administration of justice. Any person holding
such office may be disciplined or censured, in lieu of removal from office, as
provided by this section. Any person holding an office specified in this
subsection may be suspended from office with or without pay by the
Commission immediately on being indicted by a State or Federal grand jury
for a felony offense or charged with a misdemeanor involving official
misconduct.
Summary
The passage outlines circumstances under which judges in Texas may be
removed, disciplined, or suspended, which includes willful violations of
rules, incompetence, or conduct that discredits the judiciary. It also
mentions suspension upon indictment for a felony or misdemeanor involving
official misconduct. This suggests that judicial immunity may not protect
judges in cases of serious misconduct or criminal charges.

962 S.W.2d 237 Attaya v. Shoukfeh
Extract
The absolute privilege (i.e., immunity) doctrine has been firmly established
in the Texas legal system for over one hundred years... This absolute
immunity doctrine (which has been routinely extended to judicial
proceedings) means that any statement made in the trial of any case by
anyone cannot constitute the basis for a defamation or any other civil
action... The absolute privilege (i.e., immunity) has been extended to
statements made in quasi-judicial proceedings before governmental
executive officers, boards and commissions which exercise quasi-judicial
powers... The absolute privilege is intended to protect the integrity of the
process itself and to insure that the decision-making body gets the
information it needs. Even though the speaker may not deserve the
privilege, nevertheless, the law grants the privilege to protect the integrity
of the process.
Summary
The absolute immunity doctrine in Texas is well-established and applies
broadly to statements made in judicial and quasi-judicial proceedings. This
immunity is designed to protect the integrity of the judicial process and
ensure that decision-making bodies receive the necessary information
without the fear of civil liability. The passage does not specifically address
exceptions to this immunity in the context of RICO predicate acts or
document tampering, indicating that the doctrine is quite robust and not
easily circumvented.
829 S.W.2d 345 GAB Business Services, Inc. v. Moore
Extract
Second, GAB does not come within the protective ambit of the official
immunity doctrine. Under that doctrine, a state employee who gathers facts
and acts on them is clothed with quasi-judicial status and enjoys immunity
from personal liability as long as he or she acts in good faith within the
scope of his or her authority. Austin v. Hale, 711 S.W.2d 64, 66 (Tex.App.--
Waco 1986, no writ); Augustine By Augustine v. Nusom, 671 S.W.2d 112, 115
(Tex.App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1984, writ ref'd n.r.e.). GAB was not a state
employee but a private company that contracted to provide specific services
to the Risk Pool. More importantly, the jury found that GAB did not act in
good faith.

=== PAGE 21 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Summary
Quasi-judicial immunity does not apply if the entity in question is not a state
employee and does not act in good faith. The passage specifically mentions
that GAB, a private company, was not entitled to official immunity because it
was not a state employee and did not act in good faith. This suggests that for
quasi-judicial immunity to apply, the individual or entity must be a state
employee and must act in good faith within the scope of their authority.
Tex. Pen. Code § 37.13 Tex. Pen. Code § 37.13 Record of a Fraudulent Court
Extract
A person commits an offense if the person makes, presents, or uses any
document or other record with: knowledge that the document or other
record is not a record of a court created under or established by the
constitution or laws of this state or of the United States; and the intent that
the document or other record be given the same legal effect as a record of a
court created under or established by the constitution or laws of this state or
of the United States.
Summary
This statute criminalizes the act of making, presenting, or using fraudulent
court records with the intent to give them legal effect. This could potentially
apply to judges or court staff if they were involved in such conduct, thereby
negating their judicial or quasi-judicial immunity in these specific
circumstances.
Judicial Immunity
West's Encyclopedia of American Law - GALE - Jeffrey Lehman,
Shirelle Phelps - 2005-01-01
Extract
A judge generally has IMMUNITY from civil damages if he or she had
jurisdiction over the subject matter in issue. This means that a judge has
immunity for acts relating to cases before the court, but not for acts relating
to cases beyond the court's reach. For example, a criminal court judge would
not have immunity if he or she tried to influence proceedings in a juvenile
court.
Summary
N example where a judge would not have immunity if they attempted to
influence proceedings in a court where they do not have jurisdiction. This

implies that if a judge or court staff were involved in actions such as RICO
predicate acts or document tampering outside their jurisdiction or unrelated
to their judicial duties, immunity might not apply.
