Question
The husband lost his home, which he used as a place of business, as a result
of the fraudulent scheme. The husband suffered financial losses due to the
emptying of the joint bank account and the concealment of funds. Under 18
U.S.C. § 1964(c), a plaintiff in a civil RICO case must demonstrate injury to
their business or property caused by the RICO violation. The husband's loss
of his home and financial resources directly resulted from the wife's and
stepfather's fraudulent acts, satisfying the injury requirement for a civil
RICO claim.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
The husband's loss of his home used as a place of business and the financial
losses from the emptied joint bank account satisfy the "injury to business or
property" requirement under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) for a civil RICO claim. The
direct connection between these concrete financial losses and the alleged
fraudulent scheme by his wife and stepfather establishes the proximate
causation necessary for RICO standing.
Summary
The husband's civil RICO claim is supported by established legal principles
requiring a plaintiff to demonstrate injury to "business or property" caused
by a RICO violation under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). The husband has suffered
concrete financial losses through the loss of his home (which was also used
as a place of business) and through the emptying of a joint bank account and
concealment of funds. These injuries represent precisely the kind of
concrete, pecuniary injuries to proprietary interests that courts have
consistently recognized as satisfying the "business or property" requirement
under RICO.
Furthermore, the direct connection between the alleged fraudulent acts
committed by the wife and stepfather and the husband's financial losses
establishes the proximate causation mandated by Supreme Court precedent
interpreting the "by reason of" language in the statute. The fraudulent
scheme directly led to the husband's injuries, satisfying the RICO
requirement that there be a direct relationship between the alleged violation
and the resulting harm. This analysis is supported by multiple federal court
decisions that have interpreted the injury and causation requirements under 
18 U.S.C. § 1964(c).

Background and Relevant Law
Legislative Framework
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provides a
civil remedy for individuals who have suffered certain types of injuries due
to racketeering activity. The relevant statutory provision for civil RICO
claims is found in 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), which states:
"Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of
section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate United
States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and
the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee..." 18 U.S.C. §
1964(c) (2025).
This provision creates a private right of action for individuals who can
demonstrate that they have been injured in their "business or property" due
to a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962, which prohibits various forms of
racketeering activity. Successful plaintiffs are entitled to treble damages, as
well as the costs of the suit, including reasonable attorney's fees.
Case Law on "Injury to Business or Property"
Federal courts have extensively interpreted the "injury to business or
property" requirement under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), providing clear guidelines
for what types of injuries qualify for civil RICO claims.
Supreme Court Precedent
In Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indem. Co., 553 U.S. 639 (2008), the Supreme
Court explained that "RICO provides a private right of action for treble
damages to '[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a
violation,' as pertinent here, of § 1962(c), which makes it 'unlawful for any
person employed by or associated with' a qualifying enterprise 'to conduct
or participate ... in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern
of racketeering activity,' including 'mail fraud,' § 1961(1)(B)."
In Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U.S. 258
(1992), the Supreme Court further clarified that "RICO authorizes '[a]ny
person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section
1962' to sue for treble damages in federal court. 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c)." The
Court also emphasized that "a RICO plaintiff 'only has standing if, and can
only recover to the extent that, he has been injured in his business or
property by [reason of] the conduct constituting the violation.'"
It should be noted that Holmes has been stated as vacated by State v.
Swafford, 654 S.E.2d 297, 375 S.C. 637 (S.C. App. 2007). However, this
subsequent treatment appears to be in a state court context and does not
affect Holmes's authority as binding Supreme Court precedent on federal
RICO claims.

Circuit and District Court Interpretations
In Diaz v. Gates, 420 F.3d 897 (9th Cir. 2005), the Ninth Circuit reaffirmed
that "the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ('RICO'), 18
U.S.C. §§ 1961-68, provides a civil remedy of treble damages to '[a]ny person
injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of
this chapter.'" The court referenced Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., which
established that "the plaintiff only has standing if, and can only recover to
the extent that, he has been injured in his business or property by the
conduct constituting the violation."
More recent cases have continued to clarify the requirements for
establishing a RICO injury. In La Ronde-Bey v. Chica (M.D. Pa. 2024), the
court emphasized that "a plaintiff only has standing to bring a RICO claim if,
and can only recover to the extent that, he has been injured in his business
or property by the conduct constituting the violation." The court further
explained that "a plaintiff must allege (and eventually prove) that he
suffered a concrete financial loss in the form of an injury to business or
property. Allegations of 'personal injury or emotional harm are not proper
bases for a RICO claim.'"
Similarly, in Sunbelt Rentals, Inc. v. Second Life Equip., Civil Action 5:20-
CV-00070-KDB-DSC (W.D. N.C. May 06, 2022), the court outlined the
elements of a RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) as "(1) the conducting;
(2) of an enterprise; (3) through a pattern; (4) of racketeering activity." The
court noted that 18 U.S.C. § 1964 "creates a cause of action for '[a]ny person
injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of [18 U.S.C. §
1962].'"
In Ehmann v. Desert Palace, LLC, Case No. 2:19-cv-01199-APG-BNW (D.
Nev. Sep 29, 2020), the court reiterated that "in a civil RICO case, the
plaintiff must show (1) conduct, (2) of an enterprise, (3) through a pattern,
(4) of racketeering activity, (5) causing injury to the plaintiff's business or
property." The court also noted that "to have standing to sue under §
1964(c), a plaintiff must show '(1) that his alleged harm qualifies as injury to
his business or property and (2) that his harm was 'by reason' of the RICO
violation, which requires the plaintiff to establish proximate causation.'"
The "By Reason Of" Requirement and Proximate Causation
Courts have consistently interpreted the "by reason of" language in 18
U.S.C. § 1964(c) to require proximate causation between the RICO violation
and the injury to business or property.
In BCCI Holdings v. Khalil, Civil Action No. 95-1252 (D. D.C. 6/23/1999), the
court explained that "because Count I is a civil RICO claim, § 1964(c)
requires that the Liquidators show injury caused 'by reason of' Khalil's
violation of § 1962(b). The statute's 'by reason of' phrase incorporates the
principle of proximate causation."
The Supreme Court's decision in Holmes established that the "by reason of"
language in § 1964(c) requires a direct relationship between the injury and

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the alleged RICO violation. This principle has been followed in numerous
subsequent cases, including P & P MARKETING, INC. v. Ditton, 746 F. Supp.
1354 (N.D. Ill. 1990), where the court rejected attempts to narrow civil RICO
actions by requiring a special "racketeering injury," instead holding that any
injury resulting from the conduct alleged to constitute the violation of RICO
is sufficient.
Secondary Materials on RICO Injury Requirements
Secondary materials provide further clarity on what constitutes a
compensable injury under civil RICO. According to Civil Rico: A Tool of
Advocacy (2024), "to recover damages under civil RICO requires proof of
concrete financial loss and not merely injury to a valuable intangible
property interest. The measure of damages is the harm caused by the
predicate acts constituting the pattern of racketeering activity."
Similarly, Defending RICO Claims In The Business Context Part II: RICO
Claims Must Allege Injury To Business Or Property (2022) states that "if a
plaintiff brings a civil suit alleging a RICO violation, the plaintiff must
plausibly allege that his injury animating the RICO claim is associated with
his business or property by reason of the defendant's violation of the RICO
laws." The article further notes that "most courts have construed them
narrowly to mean that there must be a pecuniary injury to a proprietary
interest, and thus a plaintiff must show some sort of concrete financial loss."
PAYORS, PLAYERS, AND PROXIMATE CAUSE (2022) reinforces the
proximate cause requirement, explaining that "when a court evaluates a
RICO claim for proximate causation, the central question it must ask is
whether the alleged violation led directly to the plaintiff's injuries."
Analysis
The Husband's Loss of Home and Financial Resources
Constitute "Injury to Business or Property"
Loss of Home Used as a Place of Business
The husband's loss of his home, which he used as a place of business, clearly
constitutes an injury to both his property and business interests under 18
U.S.C. § 1964(c). Real property, such as a home, is unquestionably a
proprietary interest that falls within the scope of "property" under RICO.
When that property is also used as a place of business, its loss represents an
even more direct injury to the plaintiff's business interests.
The requirement articulated in La Ronde-Bey v. Chica (M.D. Pa. 2024) that a
plaintiff must demonstrate "a concrete financial loss in the form of an injury
to business or property" is clearly satisfied here. The loss of real property
represents a definable, concrete financial loss, distinct from mere personal
injury or emotional harm, which the court explicitly stated "are not proper
bases for a RICO claim."

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Similarly, the guidance from Defending RICO Claims In The Business
Context Part II (2022) that "there must be a pecuniary injury to a
proprietary interest" is satisfied by the loss of the home. The article further
notes that "the injury must be ascertainable and definable, such as when a
plaintiff is deprived of the ability to use or transfer property." The husband's
loss of his home represents exactly this type of definable injury, as he has
been deprived of the ability to use the property both as a residence and as a
place of business.
Financial Losses from Emptied Joint Bank Account and Concealed
Funds
The husband's financial losses resulting from the emptying of a joint bank
account and concealment of funds also satisfy the "injury to business or
property" requirement under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). Money in a bank account
is clearly property, and its loss constitutes a concrete financial injury.
In BCCI Holdings v. Khalil (D. D.C. 1999), the court recognized that financial
losses resulting from fraudulent schemes can satisfy the injury requirement
for civil RICO claims. The court noted that "as a direct and proximate result
of Khalil and Akbar's scheme to conduct the affairs of Capcom through a
pattern of racketeering activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) and (d),
the BCCI Group and their innocent creditors and depositors were injured in
their business and property, as contemplated by 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c)."
The secondary material Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024) confirms that
"to recover damages under civil RICO requires proof of concrete financial
loss." The husband's loss of funds from the joint bank account represents
precisely this type of concrete financial loss, making it a compensable injury
under civil RICO.
The Fraudulent Scheme Proximately Caused the Husband's
Injuries
Direct Causal Relationship
The husband's loss of his home and financial resources "directly resulted
from the wife's and stepfather's fraudulent acts," establishing the proximate
causation required under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c).
In Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation (1992), the Supreme
Court established that a RICO plaintiff "only has standing if, and can only
recover to the extent that, he has been injured in his business or property by
[reason of] the conduct constituting the violation." While Holmes has been
stated as vacated by State v. Swafford (S.C. App. 2007), this subsequent
treatment appears limited to a state court context and does not diminish 
Holmes's authority on federal RICO claims.
The requirement of a direct causal relationship was further clarified in 
PAYORS, PLAYERS, AND PROXIMATE CAUSE (2022), which stated that
"when a court evaluates a RICO claim for proximate causation, the central

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
question it must ask is whether the alleged violation led directly to the
plaintiff's injuries." Here, the fraudulent scheme allegedly perpetrated by
the wife and stepfather directly led to the husband losing his home and
financial resources, satisfying this requirement.
In Ehmann v. Desert Palace, LLC (D. Nev. 2020), the court explained that to
have standing under § 1964(c), a plaintiff must show "that his harm was 'by
reason' of the RICO violation, which requires the plaintiff to establish
proximate causation." The direct connection between the fraudulent acts
and the husband's losses establishes this proximate causation.
Pattern of Racketeering Activity
If the wife and stepfather engaged in a pattern of fraudulent acts that
constitutes racketeering activity under RICO, then the husband's injuries
resulting from those acts would satisfy the causation requirement for a civil
RICO claim.
As stated in Chapter 4. Elements of Cause of Action, "in civil RICO actions,
however, § 1964(c) requires proof that the pattern of mail fraud violations,
not some other act, caused the plaintiff's injury to business or property." If
the fraudulent scheme involved predicate acts such as mail fraud, wire
fraud, or other racketeering activities defined in the RICO statute, then the
causal connection between those acts and the husband's injuries would
support a civil RICO claim.
Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indem. Co. (2008) confirms that RICO provides a
private right of action for treble damages to any person injured in his
business or property by reason of a pattern of racketeering activity,
including mail fraud. If the wife and stepfather's fraudulent scheme involved
such predicate acts, the husband's resulting injuries would be compensable
under civil RICO.
Combining Business and Property Injuries
The fact that the husband's home was also used as a place of business
strengthens his civil RICO claim by establishing injuries to both business
and property interests. While either type of injury alone would be sufficient
to satisfy the statutory requirement, the combination of both types of
injuries provides an even stronger basis for standing under 18 U.S.C. §
1964(c).
In Arizona Premium Finance, Inc. v. Bielli, 77 F.Supp.2d 341 (E.D. N.Y.
1999), the court outlined the requirements for a civil RICO claim, which
include proving "that the defendant (2) through the commission of two or
more acts (3) constituting a 'pattern' (4) of 'racketeering activity' (5) directly
or indirectly invests in, or maintains an interest in, or participates in (6) an
'enterprise' (7) the activities of which affect interstate or foreign commerce."
If the wife and stepfather's fraudulent scheme satisfies these requirements,
and that scheme directly caused the husband's loss of his home (used as a

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
place of business) and financial resources, then the husband has established
the necessary elements for a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c).
Exceptions and Caveats
Personal Injury and Emotional Harm
While the husband's financial losses and loss of property clearly qualify as
injuries to "business or property" under RICO, any claims for personal injury
or emotional harm would not be compensable under civil RICO.
As stated in La Ronde-Bey v. Chica (M.D. Pa. 2024), "allegations of 'personal
injury or emotional harm are not proper bases for a RICO claim.'" If the
husband is also claiming damages for emotional distress, mental anguish, or
other forms of personal injury resulting from the fraudulent scheme, those
specific damages would not be recoverable under civil RICO, even if they
stemmed from the same fraudulent acts that caused the property and
business injuries.
Additional Elements Required for a Civil RICO Claim
While the husband's injuries may satisfy the "injury to business or property"
requirement under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), a successful civil RICO claim
requires proving several additional elements beyond injury.
As outlined in Sunbelt Rentals, Inc. v. Second Life Equip. (W.D. N.C. 2022),
the elements of a RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) are "(1) the
conducting; (2) of an enterprise; (3) through a pattern; (4) of racketeering
activity." Similarly, Arizona Premium Finance, Inc. v. Bielli (E.D. N.Y. 1999)
lists seven constituent elements for a civil RICO claim.
The husband would need to establish all of these elements, not just injury, to
succeed in a civil RICO action. This includes proving that the wife and
stepfather were involved in an "enterprise" as defined by RICO, that they
engaged in a "pattern" of "racketeering activity" as defined in the statute,
and that their activities affected interstate or foreign commerce.
Conclusion
Based on the legislative framework, case law, and secondary materials
analyzed above, the husband's loss of his home (used as a place of business)
and financial resources due to the fraudulent scheme satisfies the "injury to
business or property" requirement under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) for a civil RICO
claim.
The loss of the home represents a concrete, pecuniary injury to a
proprietary interest, which is precisely the type of injury that courts have
recognized as compensable under civil RICO. This injury is particularly
strong because the home was also used as a place of business, establishing
injuries to both property and business interests. Similarly, the financial
losses from the emptied joint bank account and concealed funds constitute

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
concrete financial losses that qualify as injuries to property under the
statute.
The direct causal connection between the alleged fraudulent acts by the wife
and stepfather and the husband's resulting injuries establishes the
proximate causation required by the "by reason of" language in 18 U.S.C. §
1964(c), as interpreted by the Supreme Court and lower federal courts.
While the husband's injuries satisfy the "injury to business or property"
requirement, a successful civil RICO claim would also require proving
several additional elements, including the existence of an enterprise, a
pattern of racketeering activity, and the impact on interstate or foreign
commerce. Additionally, while the property and business injuries are
compensable under civil RICO, any claims for personal injury or emotional
harm would not be recoverable under the statute.
In conclusion, the husband's loss of his home and financial resources
directly resulting from the wife's and stepfather's fraudulent acts satisfies
the injury requirement for a civil RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c),
providing a basis for seeking treble damages and attorney's fees as provided
by the statute.
Legal Authorities
P &amp; P MARKETING, INC. v. Ditton, 746 F. Supp. 1354 (N.D. Ill. 1990)
U.S. District Court — Northern District of Illinois
Extract
Civil actions for RICO violations are authorized by Section 1964(c) which
provides that 'any person injured in his business or property by reason of a
violation of Section 1962' may recover treble damages and costs including
attorney's fees. 18 USC § 1964(c)... In Sedima, the Court rejected attempts
to narrow or limit civil RICO actions by interpreting the injury element to
require a special 'racketeering injury' as opposed to just an injury resulting
from the conduct alleged to constitute the violation of RICO.
Summary
The passage explains that under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), a plaintiff can recover
damages if they are injured in their business or property due to a RICO
violation. The Sedima case further clarifies that the injury does not need to
be a special "racketeering injury" but can be any injury resulting from the
conduct that constitutes the RICO violation. This supports the proposition
that the husband's financial losses and loss of his home, used as a place of
business, due to fraudulent acts, satisfy the injury requirement for a civil
RICO claim.

U.S. Court of Appeals — Ninth Circuit
Extract
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ('RICO'), 18 U.S.C.
§§ 1961-68, provides a civil remedy of treble damages to '[a]ny person
injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of
this chapter.' Id. at § 1964(c). See Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S.
479, 496, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985) ('[T]he plaintiff only has
standing if, and can only recover to the extent that, he has been injured in
his business or property by the conduct constituting the violation.').
Summary
For a plaintiff to have standing in a civil RICO case, they must demonstrate
an injury to their business or property caused by a RICO violation. The
passage from "Diaz v. Gates" emphasizes that the injury must be to business
or property, not personal injury, and that the plaintiff can only recover if they
have been injured in their business or property by the conduct constituting
the violation. This supports the proposition that the husband's loss of his
home and financial resources, which are considered injuries to business or
property, satisfies the injury requirement for a civil RICO claim.

Summary
Requirement under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) for a plaintiff in a civil RICO case to
demonstrate injury to their business or property caused by a RICO violation.
It emphasizes the need for proximate causation between the RICO violation
and the injury. The case illustrates how fraudulent schemes resulting in
financial losses and property damage can satisfy the injury requirement for
a civil RICO claim. This directly supports the proposition that the husband's
financial losses and loss of his home, used as a place of business, due to
fraudulent acts, meet the injury requirement under civil RICO.

Summary
The passage from the Supreme Court decision clarifies that under 18 U.S.C.
§ 1964(c), a plaintiff must demonstrate injury to their business or property
caused by a RICO violation. The husband's loss of his home and financial
resources due to fraudulent acts aligns with the requirement of being
"injured in his business or property by reason of a violation" of RICO. The
fraudulent scheme involving the wife and stepfather could be considered a
pattern of racketeering activity, such as mail fraud, which is covered under
RICO.
Arizona Premium Finance, Inc. v. Bielli, 77 F.Supp.2d 341 (E.D. N.Y. 1999)
U.S. District Court — Eastern District of New York
Extract
To state a claim for damages under RICO a plaintiff has two pleading
burdens. First, he must allege that the defendant has violated the
substantive RICO statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1962 (1976), commonly known as
'criminal RICO.' In so doing, he must allege the existence of seven
constituent elements: (1) that the defendant (2) through the commission of
two or more acts (3) constituting a 'pattern' (4) of 'racketeering activity' (5)
directly or indirectly invests in, or maintains an interest in, or participates in
(6) an 'enterprise' (7) the activities of which affect interstate or foreign
commerce.... Plaintiff must allege adequately defendant's violation of section
1962 before turning to the second burden — i.e., invoking RICO's civil
remedies of treble damages, attorneys fees and costs....
Summary
Requirements for a civil RICO claim, which include demonstrating a
violation of the substantive RICO statute and showing a pattern of
racketeering activity. The husband's situation, involving financial losses due
to fraudulent acts, aligns with the need to demonstrate injury to business or
property caused by a RICO violation. The passage supports the proposition
by confirming that such injuries, if caused by a pattern of racketeering
activity, can form the basis of a civil RICO claim.

Nemours & Co., 431 F.3d 353, 361 (9th Cir. 2005); 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). ... In
addition, to have standing to sue under § 1964(c), a plaintiff must show '(1)
that his alleged harm qualifies as injury to his business or property and (2)
that his harm was 'by reason' of the RICO violation, which requires the
plaintiff to establish proximate causation.' Canyon Cnty. v. Syngenta Seeds,
Inc., 519 F.3d 969, 972 (9th Cir. 2008).
Summary
Elements required to establish a civil RICO claim, including the need to
show that the harm was caused by the RICO violation and that it qualifies as
an injury to business or property. This directly supports the proposition that
the husband's loss of his home and financial resources, as a result of
fraudulent acts, satisfies the injury requirement for a civil RICO claim.

Extract
A plaintiff only has standing to bring a RICO claim if, and can only recover to
the extent that, he has been injured in his business or property by the

conduct constituting the violation.[] Thus, a plaintiff must allege (and
eventually prove) that he suffered a concrete financial loss in the form of an
injury to business or property. Allegations of 'personal injury or emotional
harm are not proper bases for a RICO claim.'
Summary
Personal injury or emotional harm does not satisfy the injury requirement
for a RICO claim. This directly supports the proposition that the husband's
financial losses and loss of his home, used as a place of business, due to
fraudulent acts, meet the injury requirement for a civil RICO claim.
Wilson v. Askew, 709 F.Supp. 146 (W.D. Ark. 1989)
U.S. District Court — Western District of Arkansas
Extract
It is fundamental that the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
Act (RICO), Pub.L. 91-452, Title IX, 84 Stat. 941, as amended, 18 U.S.C. §§
1961-1968, provides a private civil action to recover treble damages for
injury 'by reason of' a violation of its provisions. See 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). ...
Although largely ignored for years, 18 U.S.C. § 1964 sets out a broad civil
enforcement scheme available to private litigants: Any person injured in his
business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter
may sue therefor in any appropriate United States district court and shall
recover threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, including
a reasonable attorney's fee.
Summary
The RICO Act provides a mechanism for individuals to seek treble damages
for injuries to their business or property caused by a RICO violation. The
passage emphasizes the broad civil enforcement scheme available to private
litigants under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), which aligns with the proposition that
the husband's financial losses and loss of his home, used as a place of
business, due to fraudulent acts, satisfy the injury requirement for a civil
RICO claim.

U.S.C. § 1964(c). ... Of course, a RICO plaintiff 'only has standing if, and can
only recover to the extent that, he has been injured in his business or
property by [reason of] the conduct constituting the violation.'
Summary
The plaintiff must have standing by showing that the injury was directly
caused by the conduct constituting the RICO violation. This directly supports
the proposition that the husband's financial losses and loss of his home, used
as a place of business, due to fraudulent acts, satisfy the injury requirement
for a civil RICO claim.

Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) provides a civil remedy for individuals who have been
injured in their business or property due to a violation of section 1962,
which pertains to RICO violations. The statute allows for the recovery of
treble damages and legal costs, emphasizing the need for a demonstrable
injury to business or property. In this case, the husband's loss of his home
and financial resources due to fraudulent acts aligns with the injury
requirement outlined in the statute.
Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
To recover damages under civil RICO requires proof of concrete financial
loss and not merely injury to a valuable intangible property interest. The
measure of damages is the harm caused by the predicate acts constituting
the pattern of racketeering activity. A compensable injury is the harm
caused by predicate acts sufficiently related to constitute a pattern.
Plaintiffs are required to set out a reasonable basis of recovery by
competent proof and not mere speculation. Only damages to 'business or
property' occurring 'by reason of' and proximately caused by the RICO
violations are compensable under § 1964(c).

Summary
To recover damages under civil RICO, a plaintiff must demonstrate a
concrete financial loss directly caused by the RICO violation. The passage
emphasizes the need for a compensable injury to business or property, which
aligns with the husband's loss of his home and financial resources due to the
fraudulent acts. The requirement for proximate cause and concrete financial
loss supports the proposition that the husband's losses satisfy the injury
requirement for a civil RICO claim.

In civil RICO actions, however, § 1964(c) requires proof that the pattern of

Notre Dame Law Review - University of Notre Dame Law School -
Crusey, Elisabeth F. - 2022-05-01
Extract
A private civil right of action in [section] 1964 provides that '[a]ny person
injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962...
may sue.' (36) Notably, a successful plaintiff under [section] 1964 is entitled
to treble damages and the cost of the suit, including attorney fees. (37) ... In
Holmes, the Court evaluated the second part of statutory standing under
[section] 1964(c)--that the injury must be 'by reason of a RICO
violation.' (58) ... In Holmes, the Court determined that 'by reason of means
that plaintiffs must establish that a defendant's alleged RICO violation
proximately caused their injuries. (60) ... The Anza Court interpreted
Holmes's proximate cause requirements for [section] 1964(c) as: '[w]hen a
court evaluates a RICO claim for proximate causation, the central question it

must ask is whether the alleged violation led directly to the plaintiff's
injuries.' (113)
Summary
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), a plaintiff must demonstrate an injury to their
business or property caused by a RICO violation. The passage explains that
the injury must be proximately caused by the RICO violation, meaning the
alleged violation must directly lead to the plaintiff's injuries. This supports
the proposition that the husband's loss of his home and financial resources,
as a result of fraudulent acts, satisfies the injury requirement for a civil
RICO claim.
Defending RICO Claims In The Business Context Part II: RICO Claims Must
Allege Injury To Business Or Property
Extract
If a plaintiff brings a civil suit alleging a RICO violation, the plaintiff must
plausibly allege that his injury animating the RICO claim is associated with
his business or property by reason of the defendant's violation of the RICO
laws. Absent these allegations, the lawsuit must be dismissed. ... Indeed,
most courts have construed them narrowly to mean that there must be a
pecuniary injury to a proprietary interest, and thus a plaintiff must show
some sort of concrete financial loss. In addition, the injury must be
ascertainable and definable, such as when a plaintiff is deprived of the
ability to use or transfer property.
Summary
For a civil RICO claim to be valid, the plaintiff must demonstrate a concrete
financial loss or injury to business or property directly caused by the
defendant's actions. The passage emphasizes the need for a pecuniary injury
to a proprietary interest, which aligns with the husband's loss of his home
and financial resources due to fraudulent acts. This supports the proposition
that the husband's losses satisfy the injury requirement for a civil RICO
claim.
