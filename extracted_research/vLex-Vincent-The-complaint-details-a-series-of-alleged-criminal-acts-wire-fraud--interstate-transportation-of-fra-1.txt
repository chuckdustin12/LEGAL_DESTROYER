Question
The complaint details a series of alleged criminal acts—wire fraud,
interstate transportation of fraudulent documents, and conspiracy—
resulting in financial and business harm to the plaintiff, rather than seeking
to alter marital status or determine support or custody. Federal courts have
jurisdiction over civil RICO claims and other federal statutory claims, even if
the underlying facts arise from a family context, so long as the relief sought
is not a divorce, alimony, or child custody decree. See Marshall v. Marshall,
547 U.S. 293, 307-08 (2006). Since the plaintiff is not asking the federal
court to dissolve a marriage, award alimony, or determine custody, but
instead seeks damages and injunctive relief for alleged racketeering activity,
the dispute is not a domestic relations dispute, but a federal statutory claim
properly within federal jurisdiction.
Answer (U.S. Federal)
Short response
Federal courts have jurisdiction over civil RICO claims even when they arise
from family contexts, provided the relief sought is not a divorce, alimony, or
child custody decree. The case presents a legitimate federal question under 
28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 18 U.S.C. § 1964 because it seeks damages for business
and property injuries resulting from alleged racketeering activity rather
than domestic relations remedies.
Summary
The distinction between domestic relations matters and federal statutory
claims is critical for determining federal court jurisdiction. When a
complaint alleges violations of federal statutes like RICO and seeks
remedies for business or property injuries rather than alterations to marital
status or family arrangements, federal jurisdiction is proper despite family-
related underlying facts. This jurisdiction is established through both 28
U.S.C. § 1331, which provides federal courts with jurisdiction over cases
arising under federal law, and 18 U.S.C. § 1964, which specifically grants
jurisdiction over civil RICO claims.
The courts have consistently recognized that the domestic relations
exception to federal jurisdiction is limited to cases seeking divorce, alimony,
or child custody decrees. When a plaintiff's claims involve alleged criminal
acts such as wire fraud, transportation of fraudulent documents, and
conspiracy that result in financial and business harm, the relief sought
(damages and injunctive relief) falls squarely within federal statutory
protection regardless of the family context from which the facts arise. The
focus should be on the nature of the claims and remedies sought rather than
the underlying factual context when determining whether federal
jurisdiction is appropriate.

Background and Relevant Law
Federal Statutory Framework for Jurisdiction
Federal jurisdiction over civil RICO claims is established through two
primary statutory provisions: the general federal question jurisdiction
statute and the specific RICO civil remedies provision.
28 U.S.C. § 1331 provides the foundational basis for federal jurisdiction:
"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising
under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States," 28 U.S.C. §
1331. This statute establishes federal question jurisdiction, which
encompasses cases that involve claims based on federal law.
Building on this general jurisdiction, the RICO statute contains specific
provisions granting federal courts authority to hear civil claims arising from
racketeering activities. Under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), "Any person injured in his
business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter
may sue therefor in any appropriate United States district court and shall
recover threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, including
a reasonable attorney's fee..." 18 U.S.C. § 1964. This provision explicitly
grants federal courts jurisdiction over civil RICO claims and establishes the
remedies available to plaintiffs.
The underlying prohibited activities that form the basis of RICO claims are
enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 1962, which makes it unlawful for:
Any person who has received income from racketeering activity to use
or invest that income in an enterprise affecting interstate commerce
Any person to acquire or maintain interests in enterprises through
racketeering activity
Any person associated with an enterprise to participate in the conduct
of its affairs through racketeering activity
Any person to conspire to violate the above provisions
18 U.S.C. § 1962 states: "It shall be unlawful for any person who has
received any income derived, directly or indirectly, from a pattern of
racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt... to use or
invest, directly or indirectly, any part of such income, or the proceeds of
such income, in acquisition of any interest in, or the establishment or
operation of, any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which
affect, interstate or foreign commerce..."
The statute further prohibits acquiring or maintaining "any interest in or
control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which
affect, interstate or foreign commerce" through racketeering activity, as well
as conducting an enterprise's affairs "through a pattern of racketeering
activity." Additionally, it prohibits conspiring to commit any of these acts. 18
U.S.C. § 1962.

Case Law on Federal Jurisdiction Over RICO Claims in
Family Contexts
Several court decisions have addressed the intersection of federal statutory
claims and matters arising from family contexts. These cases establish that
federal courts have jurisdiction over federal statutory claims, including
RICO claims, even when they arise from family-related factual scenarios,
provided they do not seek typical domestic relations remedies.
In Wiesmueller v. Oliver, Case No. 3:18-cv-01257 (M.D. Tenn. Jun 17, 2019),
the court addressed the issue of federal-question jurisdiction in cases with
domestic relations elements. The court noted: "Mr. Wiesmueller asserts two
bases for the Court's subject-matter jurisdiction over this action: 28 U.S.C. §
1331, which provides district courts with federal-question jurisdiction over
'all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the
United States,' and 18 U.S.C. § 1964, which provides jurisdiction over RICO
claims." The court applied the well-pleaded complaint rule to determine
whether federal-question jurisdiction existed under either provision.
Critically, the Wiesmueller court emphasized that "the 'key question is
whether the case is 'a core domestic relations case, seeking a declaration of
marital or parental status, or a [federal] claim in which it is incidental that
the underlying dispute involves a [domestic relations dispute].'" This
distinction is fundamental to determining whether federal jurisdiction is
appropriate in cases with family-related backgrounds but presenting federal
statutory claims.
Similarly, in Ellis v. Warner, CASE NO. 15-10134-CIV-GOODMAN (S.D. Fla.
Feb 16, 2017), the court addressed federal jurisdiction over RICO claims in
the context of related state court proceedings. The court noted that when a
plaintiff "does not challenge the outcome of the probate proceeding; rather,
her complaint is under [among other claims] the federal RICO statute," the
Rooker-Feldman doctrine (which prohibits federal courts from hearing
appeals from state court judgments) is inapplicable.
The Ellis court further stated: "If a federal plaintiff present[s] [an]
independent claim, then it is not a bar to the exercise of federal jurisdiction
that the 'same or a related question' was at issue between the parties in
state court." This principle is instructive for cases where RICO claims arise
from contexts that might otherwise involve state family courts, as it
reinforces that independent federal claims remain within federal jurisdiction
despite related state matters.
More recently, Green v. Davis, Civil Action 23-359-BAJ-EWD (M.D. La. May
30, 2023) affirmed that "a RICO claim can establish federal question
jurisdiction." This straightforward declaration underscores that RICO
claims, by their nature, establish federal jurisdiction regardless of the
factual context from which they arise.
In Diaz v. Green Tree Servicing, LLC, No. C15-359RSL (W.D. Wash. May 29,
2015), the court elaborated on the nature of RICO claims, noting: "RICO
provides for both criminal and civil liability. The civil remedies provision of

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
RICO permits '[a]ny person injured in his business or property' by reason of
a violation of RICO's substantive provisions to bring a civil action for treble
damages. 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) (2012)."
Secondary Materials on Civil RICO Claims
The secondary source Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024) provides
additional insight into the structure and application of civil RICO claims:
"The civil racketeering provisions of RICO involve three main sections of the
statute: § 1961 provides the definitions, § 1962 describes the prohibited
conduct, and § 1964 details the remedies. Federal subject matter jurisdiction
is conferred by § 1964(c), which creates the civil RICO cause of action..."
This source further clarifies that "RICO's prohibitions may be enforced in
both criminal and civil contexts. In the context of a civil action, a plaintiff
must be directly injured by reason of the defendant's racketeering
activities." This distinction highlights the separation between criminal
prosecution and civil remedies under RICO, with the latter focusing on
providing redress to individuals injured in their business or property.
The secondary material also emphasizes the causation requirement for civil
RICO claims: "Proximate cause, as an aspect of RICO's 'by reason of'
standard, requires a RICO plaintiff to show that the defendant's
racketeering offenses led directly to the plaintiff's injuries." This
requirement ensures that federal courts only hear RICO claims where there
is a direct connection between the alleged racketeering activity and the
harm suffered.
Analysis
The Nature of the Claims and Relief Sought
The complaint in question details alleged criminal acts—specifically wire
fraud, interstate transportation of fraudulent documents, and conspiracy—
that purportedly resulted in financial and business harm to the plaintiff.
Crucially, the complaint does not seek domestic relations remedies such as
divorce, alimony, or child custody. Instead, it seeks damages and injunctive
relief for alleged racketeering activity.
This distinction is fundamental to the question of federal jurisdiction. While
the factual background may involve family relationships, the actual claims
presented arise under federal law (RICO) and seek remedies specifically
authorized by federal statutes. This places the case squarely within the
jurisdiction granted by 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question) and 18 U.S.C. §
1964 (civil RICO).
As the court in Wiesmueller v. Oliver, Case No. 3:18-cv-01257 (M.D. Tenn.
Jun 17, 2019) noted, the key question is whether the case is "a core
domestic relations case, seeking a declaration of marital or parental status,
or a [federal] claim in which it is incidental that the underlying dispute
involves a [domestic relations dispute]." Here, the facts clearly indicate the

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
latter—the case presents federal statutory claims (RICO violations) for
which the family context is merely incidental to the claims themselves.
Federal Statutory Basis for Jurisdiction
RICO provides a clear statutory basis for federal jurisdiction. Under 18
U.S.C. § 1964(c), "[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason
of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any
appropriate United States district court..." 18 U.S.C. § 1964. This provision
explicitly grants jurisdiction to federal district courts over civil RICO claims.
The alleged criminal acts—wire fraud, interstate transportation of
fraudulent documents, and conspiracy—fall within the prohibited activities
described in 18 U.S.C. § 1962, which makes it unlawful for individuals to
engage in or conspire to engage in patterns of racketeering activity affecting
interstate commerce. 18 U.S.C. § 1962. RICO specifically identifies certain
predicate acts, including wire fraud, that constitute "racketeering activity"
when committed in a pattern.
Additionally, the general federal question statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1331, provides
that "district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising
under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States." 28 U.S.C. §
1331. Since RICO is a federal law, claims arising under it necessarily invoke
federal question jurisdiction.
As confirmed in Green v. Davis, Civil Action 23-359-BAJ-EWD (M.D. La. May
30, 2023), "a RICO claim can establish federal question jurisdiction." This
straightforward principle applies regardless of whether the underlying facts
involve family relationships.
Distinguishing Between Family Law Matters and Federal
Claims
The distinction between domestic relations matters and federal statutory
claims is crucial for determining federal jurisdiction. While federal courts
generally abstain from hearing "domestic relations" cases (those seeking
divorce, alimony, or child custody), they maintain jurisdiction over federal
statutory claims even when the factual background involves family
relationships.
The case presented does not ask the federal court to dissolve a marriage,
award alimony, or determine child custody. Instead, it seeks damages and
injunctive relief for alleged racketeering activity that caused financial and
business harm. These remedies are explicitly provided for under federal law
and are distinct from domestic relations remedies.
As noted in Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024), civil RICO actions require
that a "plaintiff must be directly injured by reason of the defendant's
racketeering activities." This focus on business or property injury further
distinguishes RICO claims from domestic relations matters, which primarily
concern personal status and family arrangements.

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The fact that the alleged criminal acts may have occurred within or been
related to a family context does not transform the claims into domestic
relations matters. What matters for jurisdictional purposes is the nature of
the claims asserted and the relief sought, not the factual background from
which they arise.
Precedent Supporting Federal Jurisdiction
The principle that federal courts have jurisdiction over federal statutory
claims despite family-related factual contexts is supported by case law. In 
Ellis v. Warner, CASE NO. 15-10134-CIV-GOODMAN (S.D. Fla. Feb 16, 2017),
the court recognized that when a plaintiff "does not challenge the outcome
of the probate proceeding; rather, her complaint is under [among other
claims] the federal RICO statute," federal jurisdiction is appropriate. This
principle applies equally to the present case, where the plaintiff is not
challenging family court determinations but is instead asserting
independent federal claims.
Similarly, Diaz v. Green Tree Servicing, LLC, No. C15-359RSL (W.D. Wash.
May 29, 2015) confirms that RICO's civil remedies provision permits "any
person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of RICO's
substantive provisions to bring a civil action for treble damages." This broad
grant of authority to bring civil RICO claims in federal court does not
exclude cases simply because they arise from contexts that might otherwise
involve state family courts.
Exceptions and Caveats
The Domestic Relations Exception to Federal Jurisdiction
One important caveat to federal jurisdiction is the "domestic relations
exception," which limits federal courts' authority to hear cases involving
divorce, alimony, and child custody. However, this exception is narrowly
defined and does not extend to all cases with family-related backgrounds.
As the analysis above demonstrates, the domestic relations exception does
not apply when a plaintiff asserts federal statutory claims seeking remedies
for injuries to business or property, even if the factual context involves
family relationships. The key is that the plaintiff is not asking the federal
court to issue a divorce decree, award alimony, or determine child custody—
remedies that would fall within the domestic relations exception.
It's worth noting that the domestic relations exception is a judicially created
doctrine rather than a statutory limitation on federal jurisdiction. As such,
courts have consistently interpreted it narrowly, confining it to core
domestic relations matters rather than extending it to all cases with family-
related backgrounds.

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Proximate Cause Requirement for RICO Claims
Another important caveat is the proximate cause requirement for RICO
claims. As noted in Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy (2024), "Proximate cause,
as an aspect of RICO's 'by reason of' standard, requires a RICO plaintiff to
show that the defendant's racketeering offenses led directly to the plaintiff's
injuries."
This means that to maintain federal jurisdiction under RICO, the plaintiff
must establish not only that the alleged criminal acts occurred but also that
these acts directly caused the claimed financial and business harm. If the
connection between the alleged racketeering activity and the claimed
injuries is too attenuated or speculative, the court might find that the
plaintiff lacks standing to bring a RICO claim, which could affect federal
jurisdiction.
Potential Abstention Doctrines
Although federal jurisdiction over RICO claims is clear, courts have
developed various abstention doctrines that might lead a federal court to
decline to exercise jurisdiction in certain circumstances. For example, the
Younger abstention doctrine might apply if there are ongoing state
proceedings involving the same matters, and the Rooker-Feldman doctrine
might prevent federal courts from hearing cases that effectively seek review
of state court judgments.
However, as noted in Ellis v. Warner, CASE NO. 15-10134-CIV-GOODMAN
(S.D. Fla. Feb 16, 2017), "If a federal plaintiff present[s] [an]independent
claim, then it is not a bar to the exercise of federal jurisdiction that the
'same or a related question' was at issue between the parties in state court."
This suggests that abstention would not be appropriate in cases like the one
presented, where the plaintiff is asserting independent federal claims rather
than seeking to overturn state court determinations.
Conclusion
Based on the applicable federal statutes and case law, federal courts clearly
have jurisdiction over civil RICO claims and other federal statutory claims,
even if the underlying facts arise from a family context, so long as the relief
sought is not a divorce, alimony, or child custody decree. This principle is
firmly established by both statutory provisions (28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 18
U.S.C. § 1964) and case law.
The complaint described alleges criminal acts—wire fraud, interstate
transportation of fraudulent documents, and conspiracy—that resulted in
financial and business harm to the plaintiff. These allegations fall squarely
within the scope of RICO, which prohibits such activities when they form a
pattern of racketeering. The plaintiff seeks damages and injunctive relief for
alleged racketeering activity, remedies explicitly provided for under federal
law, rather than asking the court to dissolve a marriage, award alimony, or
determine custody.

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
As the courts have consistently recognized, what matters for jurisdictional
purposes is the nature of the claims asserted and the relief sought, not the
factual background from which they arise. Since the claims here arise under
federal law (RICO) and seek remedies specifically authorized by federal
statutes (damages for business or property injuries), they fall within federal
jurisdiction despite the family-related factual context.
The domestic relations exception to federal jurisdiction is narrowly defined
and does not extend to federal statutory claims seeking remedies for injuries
to business or property. Therefore, the dispute presented is not a domestic
relations dispute that would be excluded from federal jurisdiction, but rather
a federal statutory claim properly within federal jurisdiction.
In conclusion, the federal court has proper subject matter jurisdiction over
the complaint described, as it presents legitimate federal questions under
both 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 18 U.S.C. § 1964, and seeks remedies for alleged
violations of federal law rather than domestic relations remedies.

Extract
In counts I through III of their complaint, plaintiffs allege three claims under
the Racketeer Influenced and Corruption Organization Act ('RICO'). Compl.

Summary
Nature of RICO claims, which are federal statutory claims that provide for
civil liability when a person is injured in their business or property due to
racketeering activity. This aligns with the proposition that federal courts
have jurisdiction over civil RICO claims, even if the underlying facts arise
from a family context, as long as the relief sought is not related to domestic
relations. The passage supports the idea that the federal court can hear the
case if it involves RICO claims seeking damages for business or property

U.S. District Court — Southern District of Florida
Extract
Essentially, like the plaintiff in Laudien v. Caudill, 92 F. Supp. 3d 614, 621
(E.D. Ky. 2015), Plaintiff 'does not challenge the outcome of the probate
proceeding; rather, her complaint is under [among other claims] the federal
RICO statute,' thus Rooker-Feldman is inapplicable. (internal citations
omitted). 'If a federal plaintiff present[s] [an]independent claim,' then it is
not a bar to the exercise of federal jurisdiction that the 'same or a related
question' was at issue between the parties in state court. See Exxon, 544
U.S. at 292-93.
Summary
Federal jurisdiction is appropriate for independent claims under federal
statutes like RICO, even if related issues were previously addressed in state
court. The court distinguishes between challenging a state court's decision
and pursuing a separate federal statutory claim. This supports the
proposition that federal courts can hear RICO claims arising from family
contexts, provided the relief sought is not related to altering marital status
or determining support or custody.
Green v. Davis, Civil Action 23-359-BAJ-EWD (M.D. La. May 30, 2023)
U.S. District Court — Middle District of Louisiana
Extract
Federal subject matter jurisdiction may generally be established in two ways
that are relevant to this case. First, this Court has subject matter
jurisdiction over 'civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or

of action for a violation of the Racketeer Influence and Corrupt
Organizations ('RICO') Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1961, et seq., and a RICO claim can
establish federal question jurisdiction.
Summary
A RICO claim can establish federal question jurisdiction, which supports the
proposition that federal courts can hear cases involving alleged racketeering
activities, even if they arise from a family context, as long as the relief
sought is not related to domestic relations.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
U.S. District Court — Middle District of Tennessee
Extract
Mr. Wiesmueller asserts two bases for the Court's subject-matter jurisdiction
over this action: 28 U.S.C. § 1331, which provides district courts with
federal-question jurisdiction over 'all civil actions arising under the
Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States,' and 18 U.S.C. § 1964,
which provides jurisdiction over RICO claims. To determine whether federal-
question jurisdiction exists under either provision, the Court must apply the
well-pleaded complaint rule, which asks whether 'a federal question is
presented on the face of the plaintiff's properly pleaded complaint.' ... the
'key question is whether the case is 'a core domestic relations case, seeking
a declaration of marital or parental status, or a [federal] claim in which it is
incidental that the underlying dispute involves a[domestic relations
dispute].'
Summary
Criteria for federal-question jurisdiction, emphasizing that federal courts
have jurisdiction over RICO claims and other federal statutory claims if a
federal question is presented on the face of the complaint. It distinguishes
between core domestic relations cases and federal claims where the
domestic context is incidental. This supports the proposition that federal
courts can adjudicate RICO claims arising from a family context if the relief
sought is not related to altering marital status or determining support or
custody.
28 U.S.C. § 1331 28 U.S.C. § 1331 Federal Question
Extract
The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising

Summary
28 U.S.C. § 1331 grants federal district courts original jurisdiction over civil
actions that arise under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United
States. This supports the proposition that federal courts have jurisdiction
over civil RICO claims and other federal statutory claims, as these claims
arise under federal law. The passage confirms that the nature of the claim,
rather than the context from which it arises, determines federal jurisdiction.
Therefore, even if the underlying facts are related to a family context, as
long as the relief sought is not related to divorce, alimony, or child custody,
federal jurisdiction is appropriate.

Summary
Individuals injured in their business or property due to a violation of section

collection of an unlawful debt... to use or invest, directly or indirectly, any
part of such income, or the proceeds of such income, in acquisition of any
interest in, or the establishment or operation of, any enterprise which is
engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce... It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of
racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or
maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise
which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign
commerce... It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated
with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or

activity or collection of unlawful debt... It shall be unlawful for any person to
conspire to violate any of the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this
section.
Summary
18 U.S.C. § 1962 outlines the unlawful activities related to racketeering,
which include using income derived from racketeering, acquiring or
maintaining interest in enterprises through racketeering, and participating
in enterprises through racketeering. These activities are relevant to the
proposition because they establish the basis for federal jurisdiction over
RICO claims, which are distinct from domestic relations disputes. The
statute's focus on interstate or foreign commerce further supports the
federal jurisdiction aspect.

Civil Rico: A Tool of Advocacy
The Brief - American Bar Association - 2024-01-01
Extract
The civil racketeering provisions of RICO involve three main sections of the
statute: § 1961 provides the definitions, § 1962 describes the prohibited
conduct, and § 1964 details the remedies. Federal subject matter jurisdiction
is conferred by § 1964(c), which creates the civil RICO cause of action...
RICO’s prohibitions may be enforced in both criminal and civil contexts. In
the context of a civil action, a plaintiff must be directly injured by reason of
the defendant’s racketeering activities. Proximate cause, as an aspect of
RICO’s “by reason of” standard, requires a RICO plaintiff to show that the
defendant’s racketeering offenses led directly to the plaintiff’s injuries.
Summary
Jurisdictional basis for civil RICO claims under § 1964(c), which is relevant
to establishing federal jurisdiction over claims involving racketeering
activities. It emphasizes that RICO can be enforced in civil contexts and
requires a direct injury to the plaintiff's business or property, aligning with
the proposition that the federal court has jurisdiction over such claims even
if they arise from a family context, as long as they do not seek to alter
marital status or determine support or custody.
