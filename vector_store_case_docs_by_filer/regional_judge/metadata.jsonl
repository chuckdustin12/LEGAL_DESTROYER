When a court coordinator-who is not a \nneutral party and serves at the pleasure of the judge subject to recusal-handles the \nadministrative delivery of a recusal motion, this contravenes the explicit requirements of Rule \n18a(e) and creates an appearance of impropriety. \n2. David L. Evans has allowed the coordinator Lindsey Baker -not the clerk -to handle \nthe duties the legislature explicitly designates to court clerks. Rule 18a(e)(2) plainly states that \n\" ... when a respondent judge signs and files an order of recusal or referral, the clerk of the court \nmust immediately deliver a copy to the regional presiding judge.\" \n3. Furthermore, as Rule 18(a)(f)(3) also plainly states, \" .. .ifthe respondent judge fails to \ncomply with a duty imposed by this rule, the movant may notify the regional presiding judge.\" \n4. Here, the Regional Presiding Judge was notified of and provided with a modified \nversion of the recusal motion rather than the original, and was notified of these discrepancies, but \nchose to ignore them. \nB. Recusal Tampering \n5. The record facially establishes that on October 7, 2024, the Respondent filed a Joint \nMotion"}

Repeated Tampering \n9. The record facially shows that on October 10, 2024, Judge James Munford filed an \n\"Amended Order of Referral\" and once again the correspondence to David L Evans was handled \nby the coordinator. \n10. This time, the coordinator claimed that due to the \"size of the motion\" that it could be \njustified to split the motion into three separate files, this time with the exhibits and affidavit \nincluded, defeating the entire purpose of removing the exhibits and affidavit two days earlier. \nREC. 1282 \nD.

REC. 1245-1252 It included all email exchanges with the coordinator, \nthe modifications of the original motion, with the objection specifically stating that \"the \nexplanation changed to the document being too large. This inconsistency raises concerns about \ntransparency and procedural fairness.\" No action was taken by David Evans. \nExhibit 1 \nPage 4 of 16\n\nE. Subsequent Recusals \n12. After waiting four months for the judges to be reinstated as per David Evans' order, \nRespondent had to reach out to the court coordinator to remind her to reinstate the trial judges. \nREC. 1306. \n13. The Respondent, in the face of a serious dental emergency for his youngest child, \nopened a separate SAPCR suit, arguing for dominant jurisdiction, (REC. 2088) only to be denied \naccess to the courts by Judges Kate Stone and Kenneth Newell, which prevented an emergency \nTRO needed for the safety and welfare of the Respondent's children. This negligence lead to a \ndirect injury to the youngest child in this case and three concurrent mandamus petitions \nfollowed, none of which received any response from the implicated Judges. See 25-0361, 25-\n0367, 25-0378. \n14. In the midst of these efforts, James Munford continued to ignore the issues and after \nthe SAPCR was improperly consolidated by Judge Newell, Judge Munford chose to move the \ncase towards final deposition, which was promptly objected to and ignored the same. REC. 2480. \n15. These actions lead to the second recusal motion, facially naming James Munford as \nthe respondent judge. REC. 2488. \n16. This time, David Evans addressed two major issues raised in an objection by the \nRespondent: \ni. The continued involvement of Lindsey Baker, the court coordinator; \nii. The erroneous order of referral sent by Judge Kaitcer; REC. 2620 \n17. In his order, he argued that \n\"The court coordinators and clerks work together to assist the trial judges and the administrative \njudges.

This argument fails-because the rules of procedure does not designate any role to \nthe Court Coordinator, and based on prior conduct -her involvement has facially created \nambiguity in a process designed to promote transparency and fairness. By refusing to comply \nwith the Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure in multiple recusal proceedings-there \nis no question regarding his impartiality- it has been compromised by, what the Respondent \nbelieves to be, political reasons. \n19. Even when raising these issues to the highest Court in the State on direct appeal, \nleading to cause numbers 25-0426 and 25-0458, which related to compliance with Rule 18a and \nthe entertainment and subsequent denial of a motion which was never filed, resulting in five \nconcurrent mandamus petitions before the Texas Supreme Court. \n20. All that was received in response to these efforts was \"Denied, per curiam\". \nRespondent understands that the Court of appeals has the discretion to issue such explanations, \nhowever, given the scope of these issues, they cannot be addressed at final disposition, and based \non everything above, there no reasonable possibility that one would think that there could be a \nfair and impartial trial given these circumstances. This will only lead to further appeals and more \nwasted judicial resources when these issues could just be dealt with at present. \n21.

I am the Respondent in cause number 322-744263-23, styled \"Morgan Michelle Myers v. \nCharles Dustin Myers,\" currently pending in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County, \nTexas. \n2. Since December of 2023, I have repeatedly attempted to address a fraudulent scheme to \ndivest me of my business and property interests through proper legal channels. Each time \nI have utilized legitimate legal pathways, I have been met with procedural irregularities \nand violations that have prevented fair adjudication of my claims. \n3. The Regional Presiding Judge, Honorable David L. Evans, has been directly involved in \nhandling multiple recusal proceedings related to my case, and has consistently failed to \nfollow the mandatory procedures required by Texas law, as detailed below. \n4. I have exhausted all available appellate and administrative remedies in my attempts to \nseek redress. Despite filing multiple mandamus petitions with the Texas Supreme Court \n(cause numbers 25-0361, 25-0367, 25-0378, 25-0426, and 25-0458), I have received only \n\"Denied, per curiam\" responses without substantive consideration of the serious \nprocedural violations occurring in my case. \nExhf/bit 1 \nPage 8 of 16\n\nPROCEDURAL VIOLATIONS \n5.

On October 7, 2024, I filed a Joint Motion to Recuse Honorable Judges James Munford \nand Jeffrey Kaitcer, including supporting evidence and a properly executed affidavit as \nrequired by Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a. \n6. On October 8, 2024, at 4:42 P.M., I received correspondence from court coordinator \nLindsey Baker regarding the order of referral. Upon inspection, I discovered that both my \naffidavit and supporting exhibits had been removed from the motion that was sent to \nRegional Judge Evans. \n7. I immediately notified the court coordinator that the exhibits and affidavit were missing \nfrom the materials sent to Judge Evans. The coordinator confirmed that my exhibits were \nindeed filed electronically as one document with the lead document, in accordance with \nthe Tarrant County District Clerk's Filing FAQ, which states: \"Same process for exhibit as \ninitial filings-Exhibits should be merged into one document with the lead document.\" \n8. On October 10, 2024, Judge James Munford filed an \"Amended Order of Referral,\" and \nonce again the correspondence to Judge Evans was handled by the court coordinator \nLindsey Baker rather than the clerk of the court as required by Rule 18a(e)(2). \n9. This time, the coordinator claimed that the \"size of the motion\" justified splitting it into \nthree separate files, this time including the exhibits and affidavit that had been previously \nomitted, thereby contradicting the earlier handling of the motion. \n10. These actions directly violated Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(e)(2), which explicitly \nstates: \"When a respondent judge signs and files an order ofrecusal or referral, the clerk \nof the court must immediately deliver a copy to the regional presiding judge.\" \n9 \nExhibit 1 \nPage 9 of 16\n\n11.

Instead of the neutral clerk \nof court processing these materials as required by statute, the court coordinator for the \nvery judge whose impartiality was being questioned took possession of and modified the \nrecusal motion. \nOBJECTIONS AND LACK OF REMEDY \n12. I timely filed formal objections to these procedural irregularities, including \ndocumentation of all email exchanges with the coordinator and the modifications made to \nmy original motion. \n13. My objection specifically stated that \"the explanation changed to the document being too \nlarge. This inconsistency raises concerns about transparency and procedural fairness.\" \n14. Judge Evans took no action to remedy these procedural violations despite being properly \nnotified of them. \n15. After waiting four months for the judges to be reinstated as per Judge Evans' order, I had \nto personally reach out to the court coordinator to remind her to reinstate the trial judges. \n16. When I filed a second recusal motion naming Judge Munford as the respondent judge, \nJudge Evans issued an order addressing my objections regarding: \na. The continued involvement of Lindsey Baker, the court coordinator; and \nb. The erroneous order of referral sent by Judge Kaitcer. \n17. In his order, Judge Evans stated: \"The court coordinators and clerks work together to \nassist the trial judges and the administrative judges.

As a direct result of these procedural violations and Judge Evans' failure to remedy them, \nI have suffered substantial harm, including but not limited to: \na. Being denied access to the courts when I sought emergency relief for my \nyoungest child who was facing a serious dental emergency; \nb. Being denied the opportunity for a fair hearing on my recusal motions; \nc. Having my properly filed motions improperly modified before being presented \nto the decision-maker; \nd. Being subjected to biased handling of critical procedural matters by non-neutral \nstaff members who serve at the pleasure of the judges whose impartiality I was \nchallenging; and \ne. Suffering financial harm through the continued deprivation of my property and \nbusiness interests while these procedural violations remain unaddressed. \n20. In the face of a serious dental emergency for my youngest child, I opened a separate \nSAPCR suit, arguing for dominant jurisdiction, only to be denied access to the courts by \nJudges Kate Stone and Kenneth Newell, which prevented an emergency TRO needed for \nthe safety and welfare of my children.
