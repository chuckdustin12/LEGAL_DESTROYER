This arrangement has enabled both the Petition er and Respondent to \nmaintain an active and consistent presence in their children\u2019s lives, \nencompassing not only day -to-day care but also engagement in school \nactivities and extracurricular events. This hands -on approach has been a \ntestament to their dedic ation to the well -being and upbringing of their \nchildren, demonstrating a flexible yet committed stance towards \nbalancing family responsibilities with personal and professional \ndevelopment opportunities as they arise.  \n2.The Couple had lived paycheck to paycheck for most of the marriage, and\nthings began to look up when the Petitioner acquired a job as a Leasing \nAgent/Consultant near our home. The Petitioner excelled at this position, \nand the Respondent would take care of the children from Sunrise to \nSundown, in all aspects including medical appointments  while the \nPetitioner would work  outside of the family home.  \n3.The unique situation the Couple had been blessed with put them in a\nsituation where the children could frequently visit their "}

I want \nto help and work with the citizens of Tarrant County and the families of Tarrant County to \nprovide a good and accurate judiciary that follows the rules of law.\" \nHowever, in this case, Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, has encountered a \nseries of judicial determinations that fundamentally contradict this objective. The \nassurance to uphold a judiciary that follows the rule of law has been replaced with \ndecisions that have deprived the Respondent of due process, equitable hearings, and his \nfundamental paternal rights. Respondent respectfully moves to recuse District Judge \nJames Munford and Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer pursuant to TAC \u00a7 155.152 & TEX. \nR. CIV.

The impartiality of a judge may be challenged in the trial court by a motion to \nrecuse. TEX. R. CIV. P. 18a, 18b. The Respondent respectfully moves to recuse Honorable \nJudge James Munford and Honorable Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer from presiding over \ncause number 322-744263-231 for their collective inability to remain impartial in this \nmatter by depriving the Respondent of a fair trial on four separate appearances. \"Texas \nrequires the recusal of a judge in any case where his or her impartiality might reasonably \nbe questioned, regardless of any actual bias which may be held in a case.\" Aguilar v. \nAnderson., 855 S.W.2d 799, 815. \nB. This motion has been filed at the earliest practicable opportunity, as the \nRespondent has exhausted all other available legal avenues without receiving any response, \nexplanation, or opposition.

On September 29th, 2024, the Respondent discovered a Facebook post made by \nthe Tarrant County District Courts which stated the following: \n\"The following Tarrant County District Courts will be closed tomorrow, Tuesday, January 16, \n2024. \nThis list is evolving as individual Judges are making informed decisions based on their dockets, \ninclement weather, and the safety and welfare of litigants, Court staff, counsel, and the general \npublic.\" -Tarrant County District Courts on January 15, 2024. \nThe Fort Worth Independent School District also announced that they would remain \nclosed due to inclement weather in the area. https:/lwww.fox4news.com/news/dallas-fort\u00ad\nworth-school-closings-;an-l 6. On December 14th, 2024, the petitioner requested a \nprotective order from James Munford, which was denied. Exhibit A. However, one month \nand two days later, Judge James Munford made an initial decision that has been \nunexplained for the last ten months. \nB. The initial decision at issue arose during a show cause hearing concerning an \norder of protection initiated by the petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, on December 22, \n2023. This hearing was originally scheduled to be presided over by Associate Judge \nJeffrey Kaitcer in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County at 9:00 A.M. on January 16th, \n2024. However, due to delays caused by inclement weather as mentioned above, the \n3\n\nproceedings were instead conducted by District Judge James Munford, as Associate \nJudge Jeffrey Kaitcer arrived late. \nC.

Both parties were present and appeared without legal representation. During the \nproceedings, Judge Munford presented the parties with an agreed continuance, which \nboth parties accepted, and which was subsequently granted by Judge Munford as \nreflected in his order. However, despite granting the continuance, Judge Munford went \nfurther, issuing a series of rulings where he sua sponte consolidated the protective order \ncase with the divorce case previously filed by the petitioner on December 18, 2023. \nExhibit B. He ordered the Respondent to vacate the residency that same day by 2:00 p.m., \ndivested him of the custody of his children, and the hearing was then rescheduled for \nJanuary 22, 2024, to be presided over by Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer. Exhibit C. \nD. This decision by Judge Munford undeniably raises serious questions regarding \nhis impartiality in this matter. Due process of law requires that an individual receive \nnotice and hearing before being deprived of a property right. In re the Guardianship of \nBays, 355 S.W.3d 715, 720 (Tex. App. 2011); See Grannis v. Ordean, 234 U.S. 385,394, \n34 S. Ct. 779, 783, 58 L. Ed. 1363 (1914) (\"a fundamental requisite of due process oflaw \nis the opportunity to be heard\"). Furthermore, the Texas Family Code prohibits such an \norder before notice and hearing. TEX. FAM. CODE 105.001 (\" ... an order may not be \nrendered under Subsection (a)(l) ... except after notice and a hearing ... \") (referencing \nchild custody). \n4\n\nE. Moreover, 6.405(b) of the Texas Family Code was not satisfied, which is a \nmandatory requirement before any hearing can take place given the original petition for \ndivorce claimed an active order of protection was currently in effect against the \nRespondent. Exhibit B, p. 7. (\"The petitioner shall attach to the petition a copy of each \norder described by Subsec"}

All of the procedural safeguards \nabove were disregarded by James Munford. \nF. The purpose of temporary orders with injunctive relief is not to destroy the \nstatus quo, but rather to preserve it. See Iranian Muslim Organization v. City of San \nAntonio, 615 S.W.2d 202, 208 (Tex. 1981); Davis v. Huey, 571 S.W.2d 859, 862 (Tex. \n1978); Citizens of Texas Sav. v. Fox Jacobs, 718 S.W.2d 2, 3 (Tex. App. 1985). Similarly \nto how the temporary injunction in Coyote Lake Ranch, LLC v. City of Lubbock, 498 \nS.W.3d 53 (Tex. 2016) improperly denied the City its undisputed right to access \ngroundwater-an essential resource-Judge Munford's rulings have deprived the \nRespondent of his residency, which has served not only as the family home since 2015 \nbut also as the headquarters for his business which provided for the children -an \nessential resource to their wellbeing. Furthermore, the Respondent was divested of \ncustodial rights to his children without justification. Like the injunction in Coyote, rather \nthan preserving the status quo, these initial rulings have done the opposite by depriving \n5\n\nthe Respondent of his constitutional rights to property prior to due process of law. US \nCONST. AMEND XIV,\u00a7 1; TEX CONST. ART. I,\u00a7 19. Furthermore, James Munford \nprejudged critical matters that require full evidentiary hearings. TEX. FAM.

(in regard to the temporary conservatorship for a child, for the \ntemporary support of the child, or for payment of attorney's fees.) \nG. The Respondent's burden of showing of bias or impartiality to such an extent \nthat the movant was deprived of a fair trial is satisfied from Judge Munford's initial \nruling. See Rodriguez v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., No. 04-14-00342-CV, 22 (Tex. \nApp. Jun. 17, 2015). \nH. The threshold for recusal is \"whether a reasonable member of the public at \nlarge, knowing all the facts in the public domain concerning the judge's conduct, would \nhave a reasonable doubt that the judge is actually impartial.\" Hansen v. JPMorgan Chase \nBank, N.A., 346 S.W.3d 769, 776 (Tex. App.-Dallas 2011, no pet.); Rodriguez v. \nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., No. 04-14-00342-CV, 22 (Tex. App. Jun. 17, 2015). The \nRespondent asserts that a reasonable member of the public would indeed reasonably \ndoubt James Munford was actually impartial given that he deprived the Respondent of a \nfair trial. Thus, the Respondent's burden and threshold for recusal has been met, and \nJudge James Munford should be recused from this matter. \nI. The only reasoning provided was an oral statement regarding his personal \nopinion regarding the Respondent living next door to his ex-partner's grandparents, \n6\n\nwhich is extrajudicial and comes from a biased perspective which discounted the facts of \nthe case relevant to the children's well-being. In the context of this case, recusal is \nwarranted if the trial judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned, or he has a \npersonal bias. TEX. R. CIV. P. l 8b(2).

QUESTIONING THE IMPARTIALITY OF JEFFREY KAITCER \nA. The initial ruling reset the case to January 22nd, 2024. The Respondent retained \nthe services of Dan Bacalis, while the Petitioner arrived without any legal representation \nand retained the services of Cooper Carter in the lobby of the courtroom. Much like the \nfirst setting, Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer granted a continuance which only benefitted \nthe petitioner by allowing her legal representation more time to become familiar with the \ncase while simultaneously extending the initial orders of Judge James Munford to \nFebruary I st, 2024, which significantly impacted the Respondent and his children. Exhibit \nD. Neither party appeared before the Jeffrey Kaitcer, and this decision was made without \nany input from the Respondent and without any opportunity to contest it. \nB. At the third trial setting on February 1, 2024, the parties arrived only to be \npresented with a settlement agreement from the Respondent's own counsel. Given that \nthe case had been delayed twice already and the ongoing damage from being unable to \nwork at full capacity was compounding by the day, the Respondent contested this \n7\n\nstrategy. He was informed by his attorney that the orders could be modified later and was \nurged to sign it. Left with no better alternative, the Respondent signed the agreement \nunder duress after already being deprived of his residency, children, and business since \nJanuary 161\\ 2024. Exhibit E \nC. The agreement removed the children from their own home that they had resided \nin their entire life and allowed the Respondent back into the home until March 1, 2024. It \nalso established child support, and allocated financial responsibilities to the parties, to \nwhere the Respondent was left w"}

Exhibit E \nD. Due to the Respondent's counsel drafting a settlement agreement rather than \nrepresenting the interests of his client, he was terminated shortly after the third setting on \nFebruary 5, 2024, where the Respondent began to represent himself prose. Exhibit F He \nfiled a motion to reconsider the associate judge's report for temporary orders on February \n9, 2024, which wasn't set for hearing until March 14 due to unnecessary delay by the \nopposing counsel, Cooper Carter, who has not filed any pleadings in this case on behalf \nof the petitioner. Exhibit G \nE. Given that Dan Bacalis had been terminated, and that the associate judge's \nreport signed on February 1, 2024, had clear stipulations regarding its' reduction to \nwriting Exhibit G, p.5, the Respondent filed notice with the court on March 4th, 2024, \nstating that he would not be leaving the marital residence as it was not in the best \ninterests of his children. Exhibit H \n8\n\nF. This decision prompted the petitioner to run inside the family residence on \nMarch 6th, 2024, while the Respondent was walking his daughters to school on her \nvisitation time and lock the petitioner out of the home. Since this day, the Respondent has \npursued relief to no avail, without argument, and without any response or findings of \nfacts from either judge or Cooper Carter, petitioner's counsel. \nG. On March 14, 2024, the parties appeared before Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer \nto address the Respondent's motion to reconsider. Just minutes prior to the hearing, the \nRespondent was served formally reduced temporary orders by Cooper L. Carter, which \ncontained significant clerical discrepancies and "}

Exhibit \nI. The orders also reference a hearing that was never conducted in this case. \nH. During the hearing, the Respondent was precluded from addressing the events \nleading up to February 1, 2024, due to sustained objections based on relevance. Despite \nsigning off on the Associate Judge's Report which non-suited the protective order, the \nopposing counsel was nonetheless permitted to elicit testimony from their client \nregarding her purported fear for safety should Respondent be allowed near the residency, \nwhich has not been supported by any evidence to date. \nI. Judge Kaitcer refused to admit the Respondent's exhibits, which included \naffidavits from business clients prepared to attest to his need for residency and his close \nrelationship with his daughters. Exhibit J. Judge Kaitcer further stated in open court, \nwhile drafting his ruling on the Respondent's motion, \"You don't care about your kids. \n9\n\nYou just care about your business.\" This remark, devoid of any evidentiary basis, exposed \na deep-seated bias that rendered impartial adjudication impossible. A neutral and \nimpartial evaluator would have acknowledged the interconnected nature of the \nRespondent's business, residency, and familial relationships as well as the impact of the \ninitial proceedings leading up to that point. Further, an impartial judge would have \nrealized that there is no logical explanation to remove a parent who relies on the \nresidency to provide for the children while simultaneously denying the evidence that \nwould have corroborated this need. \nJ.

Again, the order was designated as \"agreed\" despite lacking the \nRespondent's signature, was reduced outside of its' own procedural requirements ordered \nby the same judge, was reduced without any underlying motion for temporary orders ever \nserved to the Respondent and differed from the associate judge's report signed on \nFebruary 1, 2024. Rather than holding the opposing counsel and the petitioner in \ncontempt for violating Rule 13 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure for signing a \nfictitious pleading which contained false statements, Jeffrey Kaitcer deprived the \nRespondent of a fair trial, thus warranting his recusal from this matter. \nK. It is evident, based on common sense and objective evaluation of the public \nfacts regarding Jeffrey Kaitcer's conduct that no reasonable person would believe that he \nwas actually impartial knowing all of the facts of the case. After eight months of seeking \n10\n\nrelief throughout the Texas judiciary, the collective actions of Judge James Munford and \nAssociate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer remain unexplained, and the damage is ongoing. Their \njoint recusal is necessary to ensure a fair resolution of this matter and to ensure the \npersistent favoritism directed towards the petitioner is abolished. \nIV. THE AFTERMATH \nA. Since the March 14th hearing, the case has stalled. There has been no \nparticipation from the opposing party, and all attempted communications have failed. \nThere hasn't been any explanation for the denials in the Second Court of Appeals, leaving \nthe Respondent to continue seeking every remedy available to him to correct the \ndecisions presented above or receive a valid legal basis that justifies them. \nB.

The joint managing conservatorship that the current orders outline has put the \nRespondent in massive amounts of debt. He had to stay in hotels on Thursday nights in \norder to take his Children to school on Friday mornings for his visitation period, and for \nthe extended summer visitation, rented an AIR BNB in order to provide the Children with \na stable living space. The Respondent was able to have the owner of the AIRBNB located \nat 6608 Dewsbury St. that was only 1.3 miles from the Respondent's home allow him to \nport forward the router, allowing him to work to some degree, where he stayed until \nSeptember 141\\ 2024. Given the requirements to operate his business, an alternative \nresidency would take a fair amount of time to transition to, and likewise the petitioner \nwould need equal amount of time to obtain full employment in order to maintain the \n11\n\ncurrent household. All of this was explained in the Respondent's pleadings that were \nbefore the court on January 16th, 2024, but were not considered. Exhibit L, Exhibit M \nC. Since the March 14th hearing, the petitioner has moved additional family \nmembers into the home, has not paid rent, and has reduced her employment while \nsignificantly reducing the Respondents. On top of both James Munford and Jeffrey \nKaitcer's disregard for the law and the best interests of the children, the inadvertent \nfavoritism towards the petitioner has allowed her to further her own interests at the \nexpense of the status quo of the children. An impartial judge is required in this matter to \nensure that this one-sided favoritism does not continue at the expense of the children. \nD.

This information \nwas relayed to the Supreme Court of Texas, where the Respondent's motion for rehearing \non petition for writ of mandamus is still pending before the court, asking them to compel \nJames Munford to vacate the current orders which were entered by Associate Judge \nJeffrey Kaitcer as agreed without consent and referenced a hearing that has never taken \nplace. \nV.

CONCLUSION \nThis case, as detailed in the pending motion for rehearing before the Supreme \nCourt of Texas, revolves around the core issue of accountability. What began with \nMorgan Michelle Myers attempting to avoid responsibility has now evolved into a \ntroubling scenario where both judges have repeatedly failed to recognize and correct their \nserious missteps. Attorney Cooper Carter's authority to represent the petitioner, currently \nbeing challenged through a Rule 12 motion, further deepens concerns about the integrity \nand fairness of these proceedings. \nRecusing both judges is not just a procedural necessity, but a crucial step toward \nensuring that this case is reviewed impartially and that the facts are properly considered. \nThis will allow the court to focus on the petitioner's pattern of deception and, more \nimportantly, what truly serves the best interests of the children. The petitioner's actions \nhave caused unnecessary delays, destabilized her family, and inflicted significant \nemotional and financial harm on all involved. The ongoing litigation, exacerbated by a \nlack of judicial transparency and accountability, has only added to the hardship. \nDespite these issues, the Respondent holds no ill will toward any party involved. \nHis primary concern has always been, and continues to be, doing what is right for his \nchildren. The Respondent believes that with impartial judges and a renewed focus on \nfairness, this case can still be resolved justly, allowing all parties to move forward with \ndignity and integrity. The Respondent remains diligent in his commitment to securing a \nfair outcome that reflects the best interests of his children as the Family Code mandates. \n14\n\nVII.

The decisions rendered by both \nJudge Munford and Judge Kaitcer have caused significant harm to my ability to \nmaintain stability for my children and have compounded my financial hardship. \n18\n\n5. I have attempted to address these concerns through all available legal avenues, yet \nI have received no adequate response or resolution.

I attest that all facts presented in the Joint Motion for Recusal are true and accurate \nbased on my personal experience and knowledge. I have made every effort to act \nin the best interests of my children throughout these proceedings, and I believe \nthat the recusal of both judges is necessary for an impartial review of this case. \n7. I further attest that the petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, has knowingly made \nfals_e statements and misrepresented facts in order to benefit herself in these \nproceedings, which has inadvertently caused harm to our children. These false \nstatements have contributed to the current instability and emotional distress they \nare experiencing.

EMERGENCY PROTECTIVE ORDER \n1. As mentioned above, Petitioner filed for an Emergency Protective Order on \nDecember 14th, 2023. This protective order was denied by the courts. \n2. Due to the fact this order was not granted by the court, one could conclude that \nthere was not a clear and present danger of family violence.1 \nB. THE DIVORCE PETITION \n1. Petition was filed on 2024-12-18 under an Affidavit of Inability to pay.2 \n2. The Petitioner's action of filing for divorce under an Affidavit of Inability to pay \nthree days after transferring $1,576 to herself starkly contravenes the mandates \nset forth in Chapter 10, Section 10.001 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code. This \nsection asserts that each claim or legal contention must be warranted by existing \nlaw or a nonfrivolous argument for the modification of existing law or the \nestablishment of new law, and that each factual contention has or is likely to have \nevidentiary support after further investigation or discovery3\u2022 \n3. The Petitioner violated Chapter 10, Section 10.001 a second time within the \nsame document when she intentionally elected to waive the 60-day waiting \nperiod claiming to have an active protective order against me that found family \nviolence had occurred during our marriage4 despite being denied such an order \njust five days prior on December 14th, 2023. \n5. The final page of the Divorce Petition for service to the Office of the Attorney \nGeneral was left unsigned by the Petitioner. \n1 TEXAS FAMILY CODE, TITLE 4, SUBTITLE B, CHAPTER 83, Sec. 83.001 \n2 See attached EXHIBIT B.l -A True and Accurate copy of the Divorce Petition for all references made in regard to \nthis document. \n3 CML PRACTICE AND REMEDIES CODE, TITLE 2, SU"}

The suit was unlawful by natures, as the grounds for eviction were based on \nfamily status, referencing the divorce as well as a protective order that had been \ndenied on December 14th, 2023. The suit was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction on \nJanuary 17th, 2024. 6 \nD. PROTECTIVE ORDER \n1. This suit was the second attempt by the Petitioner to have me removed from \nthe home, which ultimately succeeded. \n2. The claims within this suit mentioned sexually aggressive comments and \nthreatening behavior. These allegations are materially false, as the Petitioner \npossesses no evidence, and has presented no evidence in relation to these claims \nsince the initiation of the suit. Despite this, as video and image evidence will show \nonce a fair trial date is set, the Petitioner and I continued to maintain stability at \nour family home and preserved the sense of normalcy that our daughters have \nbeen accustomed to their entire lives up until January 16th, 2024. \nThe Court's decision to remove me from my home and my children's lives on January \n16th, 2024, albeit preliminary and unjustified, bypassed the safeguarding of the children's \nemotional, psychological, and physical well-being.

Following the court's directive, I relocated to my father's residence in Flower Mound until \nthe subsequent hearing.

On February 1st, 2024, during the third hearing, the substantive issues I had raised were \nnot addressed, nor was there any exchange of evidence between our legal representatives. \nDespite the focus of the hearing supposed to be on the protective order, the discussions \nveered into custody and child support matters. My lawyer presented the sole option of a \ntemporary return to the family home for 30 days with expanded visitation rights, coupled \nwith a child support obligation starting in April. This outcome, which diverged significantly \nfrom the case's core issues, compelled me to reconsider my legal representation. \nConsequently, I decided to terminate my attorney's services and embarked on drafting this \nmotion myself, aiming to bring the court's attention back to the pivotal elements of the case \nthat had thus far been neglected while able to legally reside in my home. \nCONCLUSION AND PRAYER \nIn conclusion, this motion has laid bare the stark realities and procedural aberrations that have \nmarred the essence of justice and due process in the matter of Cause No. 322-744263-23. \nThrough the course of these proceedings, it has become abundantly clear that the actions taken \nby the Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, have not only disregarded the welfare and best \ninterests of our children but have also illuminated her unfitness as a parent. Her actions speak \nto a pattern of deceit, manipulation, and an unsettling willingness to leverage the judicial \nsystem for personal vendettas, all at the expense of the emotional and psychological well-being \nof our children. \nThe court, in its decisions, inadvertently facilitated this troubling trajectory by removing me, \nCharles Dustin Myers, from the lives of our children based on unsubstantiated claims and \nwithout due consideration of my role as a dev"}

The following reasons why it is impossible for the Respondent \nto vacate the family home under the current agreement pending review are as follows: \n1. Since the inception of the case, the Respondent's primary focus has been to reset \nthe status quo ante for the benefit of the children, ensuring their lives remain as \nnormal and uninterrupted as possible during this transitory period after it was \nsignificantly disrupted beginning on January 16th, 2024. Despite the challenges \nposed by the non-suited protective order and the dropped allegations of family \nviolence which were the foundations of all decisions made within this case, the \nRespondent has respected the orders pending review, and has strived to provide a \nstable and supportive environment for his children during his designated time, all \nwhile planning a transition that best suits his children. \n2. During the short amount of time the Respondent has been re-instated to his home, \nthe Petitioner has, on multiple occasions, entered the residence unannounced and \nwithout prior consent, actions which stand in stark contrast to her prior requests \nfor protection which have governed this case. \n,\u2022\u2022-\u2022o;;~;~'.;;\u2022...

This shift coincides with Mr. \nMyers facing significant personal and legal challenges, including a divorce \nproceeding that has drastically impacted his ability to operate his business \neffectively. A particularly distressing development for Mr. Myers has been his \ninability to access the physical location where his business equipment and \ndata connections are housed. This situation has not only disrupted the service \nbut has also imposed significant financial difficulties on Mr. Myers, threatening \nthe sustainability of the business and the quality of service that customers \nhave come to expect. \nThe repercussions of these challenges have been felt deeply by both Mr. \nMyers and his clientele. While the community understands and sympathizes \nwith Mr. Myers' personal struggles, the increasing service disruptions have \nraised concerns among users about the future reliability and viability of the \nservice. We are hopeful for a resolution that will allow Mr. Myers to regain \naccess to his business infrastructure, thereby restoring the service quality and \nreliability that we have valued highly.

Therefore, the immediate priority rs to facilitate a transition where both parties can \nestablish their respective independent living and working arrangements without disrupting the children's \nlives. \n2.

Work and Research Commitments: \nThe concurrent legal proceedings, particularly those based on unverified claims, demand a substantial \namount of my time for research and preparation to protect the children's well-being. \nMy ability to work has been affected by the proceedings, necessitating an adjustment in my day-to-day \nroutine to accommodate these new responsibilities. \n4. Interim Custody Logic: \nContinuity for Children: While we navigate these proceedings, It is critical to maintain stability and \ncontinuity for our children. Any temporary custody arrangements should reflect the least disruptive path \nfor them. \nCounseling and Mediation: I strongly advocate for counseling or mediation to reconcile and navigate the \ndivorce process, emphasizing the children's best interests rather than abrupt and contentious changes. \n5. Court's Facilitation: \nThe court's facilitation in endorsing a temporary and flexible visitation framework Is crucial. This \nframework must account for the current living situation and the significant emotional and logistical \nupheaval that the divorce proceedings have caused. \nThis proposal is made in the spirit of cooperation, with a focus on minimizing the impact of our marital \ndissolution on our children. It is with a sincere hope that we can transition into a stable co-parenting \narrangement that keeps our children's welfare as the priority. \nRespectfully submitted, \nx~~ a\\-o~-J.~~ \nCharles D ~yers \n6641 Anne Court \nWatauga, Texas 76148 \n817-507-6562 \nChuckdus"}

App.--San Antonio 1984, writ \ndism'd) (\"[A]n attorney who has conducted a case in the trial court is \npresumed to have authority to pursue an appeal, although this presumption can \nbe rebutted.\"). Here, however, this presumption is to be rebutted for the \nforegoing reasons: \n1\n\nI. Legal Basis for Rule 12 Motion \n2. Pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. \u00a7 12, a party may challenge an attorney's \nauthority to act on behalf of a party in a proceeding. When such a challenge is \nraised, the burden of proof shifts to the challenged attorney to demonstrate \ntheir authority to represent the party. Id. The attorney must appear before the \ntrial court and show sufficient authority to prosecute or defend the suit on \nbehalf of their client. (Breceda v. Whi (2006) 187 S.W.3d 148, 152; Kelly v. \nMurphy (1982) 630 S.W.2d 759, 761). \n3. Rule 12 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure permits any party to \nchallenge an attorney's authority to prosecute or defend a lawsuit. (See Nolana \nOpen MRI Ctr., Inc. v. Pechero (2015) No. 13-13-00552-CV, at *15). The \npurpose of a Rule 12 motion is to protect parties from groundless suits and to \npermit dismissal of suits instituted without authority. (See Nicholas v. Envtl. \nSys. (Int'!) Ltd. (2016) 499 S.W.3d 888, 895; Angelina Cty. v. McFarland \n(1964) 374 S.W.2d 417, 422-23). \n4. Here, the procedural inconsistencies, lack of formal notice, and \nsubmission of documents by other parties on behalf of Ms. Carter raise \nsubstantial doubts about whether she possesses the necessary authority to \nrepresent the Petitioner. Despite being allegedly retained on January 22, 2024, \nMs. Carter has not filed a formal notice of appearance, leaving her role \nambiguous.

Further complicating matters, filings under her name have been \nsubmitted by others, including the founder of Marx Altman & Johnson, her \npurported former employer. Coupled with her suspiciously timed State Bar \nprofile update and lack of meaningful engagement, these facts compel the \nRespondent to seek clarification and challenge her authority under Rule 12. \n2\n\nII. Procedural Basis \n5. No Formal Notice of Appearance Filed. Although Cooper Carter \nwas allegedly retained on January 22, 2024, she has not filed a formal Notice \nof Appearance in this case. The absence of a Notice of Appearance creates \nsubstantial ambiguity regarding her authority to represent the Petitioner, \nespecially given the procedural irregularities discussed below. \n6. Lack of engagement. Throughout the proceedings, Ms. Carter \nhas consistently failed to engage in any meaningful way and has failed \nto respond to any pleadings in the suit. \n7. Filings Submitted on Behalf of Cooper Carter. All court 1 \ndocuments and pleadings attributed to Ms. Carter have been submitted \"on her \nbehalf' by Roderick Marx, the founder of Marx Altman & Johnson.

The \nRespondent has actively been seeking relief from the result of the \naforementioned hearing for nearly seven months without any engagement or \nany authoritative activity from Ms. Carter, thus warranting this motion. \nIII. Prayer and Relief \n9. Given the ongoing procedural irregularities and the apparent lack of \nclarity surrounding Cooper Carter's authority to represent Petitioner Morgan \nMyers, the Respondent respectfully requests the following: \n1. The Court should schedule a hearing requiring Cooper Carter to \npersonally appear and definitively prove her authority to represent \nMorgan Myers, and to provide clarification as to who is involved in \nthe case, and in what capacity Morgan Michelle Myers is being \nrepresented in this matter. \n11. \"Upon [her] failure to show such authority, the court shall refuse \nto permit the attorney to appear in the cause, and shall strike the \npleadings if no person who is authorized to prosecute or defend \nappears.\" (Tex.
