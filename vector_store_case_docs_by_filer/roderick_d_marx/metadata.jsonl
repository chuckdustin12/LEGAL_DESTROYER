STATEMENT OF FACTS\n1. On January 24, 2025, after more than 11 months of inaction, Petitioner\nfiled a Motion to  Dismiss for Want of Prosecution. The divorce case no \nsubstantive action from Respondent  since April 2024, a legal ghost ship drifting \nwithout direction or purpose. That motion wasn\u2019t attempted to be set for hearing until September of 2024, only after the Petitioner exhausted all efforts seeking relief throughout the Texas Judiciary without any participation from the opposing side. \n2. On March 19, 2025, driven by mounting concerns about the children\u2019s\nwelfare and learning that the 322\nnd District Court did not have continuous, \nexclusive jurisdiction over the children in this matter , Petitioner  filed a new M.2377 M.2377\nM.2377 M.2377 M.2377 M.2377\n\n5 SAPCR in this Court (Cause No. 233-765358- 25) seeking emergency  relief for \nthe children.

On March 21, 2025, Petitioner  filed a verified Rule 12 motion\nchallenging Ms. Carter\u2019s authority to represent Respondent in this matter\u2014the second such challenge,  met with the same resounding silence as the first.  \n4. On March 25, 2025, Petitioner  filed an Objection to Consolidation and\nan Ex -Parte Emergency Motion for TRO. Two days later, on March 27, 2025, \nPetitioner contacted the court coordinator, requested a date and time to present the motion, and served the documents to the opposing party with the intent to present on March 28, 2025, at 9:00 A.M. before the Associate Judge of this Court. On that fateful morning of March 28, 2025, Petitioner  drove to the courthouse, paid for \nparking, met with the coordinator, communicated with opposing counsel, and secured a hearing date of April 10, 2025. Petitioner  then proceeded to the \nAssociate Judge\u2019s courtroom to present the TRO. \n5.Before Petitioner  could present his case\u2014before he could speak a single\nword about his children\u2019s welfare\u2014he was told that Ms. Carter would be filing a motion to  consolidate in the 322nd District Court, that his motion was improperly \nbefore  the court, and that the Associate Judge refused to hear the motion.

Ms. Carter wasn\u2019t even present in the courtroom, yet \nher words carried more weight than Petitioner\u2019s physical presence,  his properly \nfiled papers, and most importantly, the urgent needs of his children. She stopped the proceedings with nothing more than word of mouth for the incorrect motion. A true showcasing of disregard for the process, and the children. \n6.

On April 4, 2025, unable to acquire a ruling due to Petitioner\u2019s\nobjection, Ms. Carter attempted to set the motion for a hearing before the 322nd District Court. That same day, Petitioner  filed a Pre-Objection to Motion to \nTransfer in this Court, given that  a motion to transfer must come before any \nattempt at consolidation.  Ms. Carter, who had been so urgently concerned about \nconsolidation when it served to block Petitioner\u2019s  emergency hearing, suddenly \nclaimed to be unavailable until late April\u2014causing significant delays that could have been avoided had this Court simply heard the motion before it on March 28, 2025.

But the financial toll \npales in comparison to the emotional cost of watching Petitioner\u2019s  children  suffer \nwhile the courts exchange procedurally incorrect  volleys over his head.  \nIII. ARGUMENT\nA. The Court's Ministerial Duty\n9. It is well- established Texas law that a trial court has a ministerial\nduty\u2014not a discretionary duty\u2014to consider and rule upon motions properly filed and pending before it. In re Sheppard, 193 S.W.3d 181, 183 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2006, orig. proceeding); In re Chavez, 62 S.W.3d 225, 228 (Tex. App.\u2014Amarillo 2001, orig. proceeding). The Texas Supreme Court has consistently held that while a court has discretion in how it rules on a motion, it has no discretion to refuse to rule at all. In re Blakeney, 254 S.W.3d 659, 661 (Tex. App.\u2014Texarkana 2008, orig. proceeding) (\"When a motion is properly filed and pending before a trial court, the act of considering and ruling upon that M.2380 M.2380\nM.2380 M.2380 M.2380 M.2380\n\n8 motion is a ministerial act, and mandamus may issue to compel the trial judge to \nact.\").  \n10. This principle is not merely a procedural nicety but a fundamental\ncornerstone of our judicial system. When a court refuses to hear a properly filed motion, it effectively denies access to justice itself. As the Texas courts have repeatedly emphasized,  \"A trial court's refusal to rule on a pending motion within \na reasonable amount of time constitutes a clear abuse of discretion.\" In re Bonds, 57 S.W.3d 456, 457 (Tex. App.\u2014San Antonio 2001, orig. proceeding). This abuse is magnified exponentially when the motion concerns the welfare of children and seeks emergency relief.  \n11. The Court's refusal to hear Petitioner's properly filed emergency TRO\non March 28, 2025, constitutes a clear failure to perform a ministerial duty. This failure is particularly concerning  given that: \na) The motion was properly filed and noticed for hearing and the parties agreedon a date and time set for April 10\nt"}

M.2381 M.2381\nM.2381 M.2381 M.2381 M.2381\n\n9 B. Clear Abuse of Discretion\n12.A writ of mandamus is appropriate when a trial court clearly abuses its\ndiscretion  and there is no adequate remedy by appeal . In re Prudential Ins. Co. of \nAm., 148 S.W.3d 124, 135-36 (Tex. 2004); Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, \n840 (Tex. 1992) . An abuse if discretion is clearly established from point one \nbelow, and supported by points two through eight: \ni.First, it refused to perform its ministerial duty to hear and\nrule on a properly filed motion based solely on representations \nabout a future filing in another court. It\u2019s as if a doctor refused to \ntreat a bleeding patient because another doctor  might, at some \nfuture date, claim the patient should be treated at a different  \nhospital. \nii.Second, it failed to recognize that by answering the\nSAPCR petition in  this Court, Respondent submitted to this \nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction and should have instead filed a motion to abate \nor should have moved to transfer the case. The law doesn\u2019t allow \nfor half-measures of jurisdiction. \niii. Third, it failed to recognize that this Court maintained\njurisdiction until any  transfer was completed pursuant to Texas \nFamily Code \u00a7 155.005(d) as no final order has been rendered in \nthe 322nd District Court. Jurisdiction  isn\u2019t a hot potato to be M.2382 M.2382\nM.2382 M.2382 M.2382 M.2382\n\n10 dropped at the first mention of another court\u2014it\u2019s a  solemn \nresponsibility th"}

Fourth, it failed to recognize that the proper procedure\nfor consolidation of cases in different courts requires a motion to \ntransfer to be filed and granted before any motion to consolidate \ncan be considered, pursuant to Texas Family Code \u00a7\u00a7 155.201 and \n6.407. The law provides a sequence, a proper order of operations, \nthat cannot be reversed or circumvented without creating \nprocedural delay, which is what the emergency TRO sought to \nprevent from occurring. \nv. Fifth, it allowed opposing counsel to circumvent proper\nlegal procedure by  influencing this Court\u2019s decision without being \npresent and without having filed any response to the emergency \nTRO  properly before this Court. It\u2019s as if the referee in a football \ngame made a call  based on what someone in the parking lot said \nmight happen in the fourth quarter  when she had the rules of the \ngame mixed up. \nvi. Sixth, it failed to consider that the purported \u201cagreed\u201d\norders in the divorce case are void for lack of consent under \nBurnaman v. Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 (Tex. 1951). A void \norder is no order at all\u2014it\u2019s a legal nullity, as insubstantial as a M.2383 M.2383\nM.2383 M.2383 M.2383 M.2383\n\n11 shadow on the wall. No court has continuous, exclusive \njurisdiction over the children in this matter.  \nvii.Seventh, it failed to recognize that the Associate\nJudge\u2019s orders in the divorce case were never properly adopted by \nthe referring District Court as required  by Texas Family Code \u00a7 \n201.013(b). An unadopted order is like an unsigned check \u2014it may \nlook official, but it carries no legal weight, yet it has been used to \nbar the Petitioner from his residence, business, and children, and \nimpose a disruptive and chaotic schedule upon the children. \nviii.Eighth, an"}

No Adequate Remedy by Appeal\n13.When Justice Delayed Is Justice Denied  Petitioner has no adequate\nremedy by appeal for reasons that should stir the conscience of any court:  The \nemergency nature of the injunctive relief sought requires immediate action, as M.2384 M.2384\nM.2384 M.2384 M.2384 M.2384\n\n12 Petitioner\u2019s children are suffering immediate and ongoing harm while procedural \nissues remain unresolved . In re Texas Dep\u2019t of Family & Protective Servs. , 255 \nS.W.3d 613, 615 (Tex. 2008) (granting emergency relief where children\u2019s welfare was at immediate risk).  Petitioner\u2019s children are being alienated from him,  \ncausing long-term psychological damage that cannot be undone by a favorable ruling months or years in the future. In re Scheller , 325 S.W.3d 640, 643 (Tex. \n2010) (recognizing that interference with the parent -child relationship can \nconstitute irreparable harm).  \n14. The improper procedural maneuvers by opposing counsel are causing\nsignificant delays that cannot be remedied through the normal appellate process. Each  day that passes is another day the children suffer, another day their academic  \nperformance declines, another day they become more emotionally estranged  in a \nsituation that the law should\u2019ve prevented from existing to begin with. \n15.Temporary orders in family law cases are generally no"}

In re Team Rocket,  L.P. , 256 S.W.3d 257, 262 (Tex. 2008).  \nD. Opposing Counsel\u2019s Contradictory Behavior\n17. Cooper L. Carter\u2019s contradictory behavior warrants particular\nattention, like a  character in a novel whose actions never quite align with their \nwords: She zealously defended her client by filing an answer to the SAPCR in this Court, thereby submitting to this Court\u2019s jurisdiction, only to then influence this Court to refuse to hear Petitioner\u2019s  properly filed motion by representing that she \nwould file a motion to consolidate in the 322nd Court, which would be moot by statute.  \n18. She had abandoned the divorce case for nearly a year, filing nothing\nsince April  24, 2024, only to suddenly reappear precisely when I sought \nemergency relief for  the children \u2014like a firefighter who ignores a smoldering \nhouse for months, only to rush in when someone else calls for help.

She subsequently filed an improper motion to consolidate in the \n322nd Court without first filing the required motion to transfer, putting the procedural cart  before the horse.  She is now claiming unavailability until late \nApril in the 322nd Court, creating unnecessary delay after using the urgency of consolidation to block Petitioner\u2019s  emergency  hearing.

It\u2019s a shell game played with the children\u2019s welfare as \nthe prize.  This Court should not allow itself to be used as an instrument in such \nprocedural gamesmanship, particularly when it involves a failure to perform a \nministerial duty required by law and when children\u2019s welfare is at stake. \nIV. CONCLUSION\nThis Court\u2019s refusal to hear Petitioner\u2019s properly filed motion constitutes a \nfailure to perform a ministerial duty for which there is no adequate remedy by appeal. The proper legal procedure requires a motion to transfer to be filed and granted before any motion to consolidate can be considered, and by answering the SAPCR petition in this Court, Respondent submitted to this Court\u2019s jurisdiction. \nThe children who are the subject of this proceeding are suffering \nimmediate and  ongoing harm while procedural issues remain unresolved. Each \nday that passes  without addressing the emergency concerns raised in Petitioner\u2019s \nTRO is a day  of certain  damage to the children\u2019s psychological well- being and \ndevelopment. \nPetitioner once heard it said that the true measure of a society is found in \nhow it treats its most vulnerable members.

He reiterates that h e honored the procedures. H e \nplaced his faith in  a system that promised justice would flow like water, clear a nd \nunobstructed, to those who seek it properly. \nPetitioner asks this Court to remember that behind every case number, \nbehind every filing, behind every procedural rule, there are often  real children \nwith real lives  that continue whether the courts act or not.

On January 31, 2024, Mother obtained counsel Cooper L. Carter who filed a First Amended Petition for Divorce and Movant Father filed a First Amended Counterpetition for Divorce via Daniel R. Bacalis, his hired counsel.  On February 1, 2024, the parties attended a hearing for Temporary Orders and Application for Protective Order. At the hearing, both parties had legal representation and were able to come to an agreement as evidenced by the Agreed Associate Judge\u2019s Report for Temporary Orders that was signed by all parties, attorneys, and the Court. Additionally, Temporary Orders were drafted in this proceeding based on the Agreed Associate Judge\u2019s Report for Temporary Orders and were signed by the Court. These Temporary Orders contained orders regarding conservatorship, possession and access, child support, medical support, and temporary division of property and debt, as well as mutual injunctions. Thereafter, Movant Father terminated Mr. Bacalis as his attorney of record and began to represent himself throughout the rest of the litigation proceeding.  On March 14, 2024, the Court heard Movant Father\u2019s Motion to Vacate Temporary Orders and the request was denied by the Court.  On April 24, 2024, Mtoher\u2019s counsel filed a Motion for Pretrial Conference so as to move the case forward and request a Final Trial date.

Movant Father\u2019s requested relief in his Motion for No-Evidence Summary Judgment should be denied in its totality.   II. SUMMARY JUDGEMENT EVIDENCE  Movant Father\u2019s Motion should be denied because the entirety of his Motion is not competent summary judgment evidence (insomuch as it is not support by required filings consistent with the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure).   In the event the Court deems that Movant Father\u2019s summary judgment \u201cevidence\u201d is competent, which is it not, Movant Father\u2019s summary judgment evidence and request is limited in this respect as it does not take into account the significant questions of fact that both Mother and Movant Father\u2019s allege in their respective pleadings.   First, this is not a marriage that solely requires property division. This marriage contains two children that are subject to this suit. In Mother\u2019s current pleadings, Mother alleges that the\n\nappointment of Joint Managing Conservators would not be in the best interest of the children and that she should be appointed as sole managing conservator of the children the subject of the suit upon final orders due to, in part, Movant Father\u2019s history or battery of family violence, child abuse, and/or child neglect and that supervised visitation is required in order to protect the children the subject of this suit. These are genuine issues of material fact that require the Court to hear the matters at hand to make decisions regarding the best interest of the children.  The best intere"}

These are genuine issues of material fact that require the Court to hear the matters at hand to make decisions regarding the best interest of the children.  The best interest of the children shall always be the primary consideration of the court in determining the issues of conservatorship and possession of and access to a child. Texas Family Code Section 153.002. Additionally, the Texas Family Code requires the court to consider evidence of intentional use of abusive physical force, or evidence of sexual abuse committed within a two-year period preceding the filing of the suit or during the suit when making decisions regarding sole or joint conservatorship. Tex. Fam. Code Section 153.004(a).   Regardless, these are genuine questions of material fact involving this proceeding and evidence of this may be shown in the attached exhibits, Mother\u2019s Affidavit attached herein, as well as Mother\u2019s testimony that she plans to give at trial.   Second, there are issues regarding child support and medical support as well as the confirmation of child support arrears that have accumulated during the pendency of this proceeding that are questions of fact needing litigation to decide alongside the Office of the Attorney General.   Third, Mother is also requesting a disproportionate share of property division for various reasons that also raise a question of material facts in this litigation. Mother is requesting a disproportionate share of the property due to the following reasons:  a. Fault in the breakup of the marriage;  b. Benefits the innocent spouse may have derived from the continuation of the marriage;\n\nc. Disparity of earning power of the spouses;  d. Health of the spouses; e. Spouse to whom conservatorship is granted;  f. Needs of the children of the marriage;  g. Education and future employability of the spouses;  h. Community indebtedness and liabilities;  i.

The Movant Father\u2019s Motion should be denied because the evidence of these allegations establishes a genuine issue of material facts that should be litigated at trial.  III. STANDARD OF REVIEW AND ARGUMENT  The Court\u2019s judgment south shall be rendered forthwith if 1. The deposition of transcripts, interrogatory answers, and other discovery responses referenced or set forth in the motion or response, and 2. The pleadings, admissions, affidavits, stipulations of the parties and authenticated or certified public records, if any, on file at the time of the hearing, or filed thereafter and before judgment with permission of the court, show that, except as to the amount of damages, there is no genuine issue as to any material fact. Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 166(c).  In regards to no-evidence summary judgments, a court cannot grant a no-evidence motion for summary judgment if the responding party produces summary judgment evidence that raises a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact. TRCP 166(i). This statute is strictly enforced, and courts have held that a no-evidence motion that lists each element of the plaintiff\u2019s claim and then asserts that the plaintiff has no evidence to support \u201cone or more\u201d or \u201cany of\u201d those elements is insufficient to support summary judgment because this language does not clearly identify which elements, whether some or all, are challenged. Community Health Sys. V. Prof\u2019l Servs. V. Hansen, 525 S.W.3d 671, 695-96(Tex.2017).    In this case, Movant Father has failed to specifically name the claims and elements that Petitioner has supposedly no evidence to support. He simply lists family violence, the existence of a pr"}

In this case, Movant Father has failed to specifically name the claims and elements that Petitioner has supposedly no evidence to support. He simply lists family violence, the existence of a protective order, financial indigence, and temporary orders as the claims that he is asserting Petitioner has no evidence of. However, these listed claims do not match the claims that are asserted by Mother and are not the entirety of Mother\u2019s claims asserted in her First or Second Amended Petition for Divorce.  When a motion for no-evidence summary judgment is filed, the burden does shift to the responding party to present evidence that raises a genuine issue of material fact to the elements specified in the motion. Mack Trucks, Inc. v. Tamez, 206 S.W.3d 572, 581-82 (Tex.2006). This evidence is then reviewed in light favorable to the responding party and against the party bringing the summary judgement. Id. The responding party is required to provide more than a scintilla of evidence in their response for a no-evidence motion for summary judgment to be denied. King Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman, 118 S.W.3d 742, 751 (Tex. 2003).  In this case, there is extensive evidence to prove that there are genuine issues of material fact regarding all issues asserted by the Mother in her pleadings, including but not limited to her claim that joint managing conservatorship would not be in the best interest of the children and that she should be appointed as sole managing conservator, that Movant Father should pay guideline\n\nchild support and medical support and what that amount would be, whether Movant Father committed family violence, child abuse, and/or child neglect, that Mother should be awarded her separate property and what that property is, that Mother should be awarded a disproportionate share of community property, that Mother\u2019s information should remain confidential, and that Mother should be awarded reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and that previous fees and support should be confirmed "}

Evidence of these claims can be found attached to this response herein and includes, but is not limited to:   1. Pleadings on file in this case;  2. Communication between parties during the course of this litigation showing threats that Movant Father has made to Mother; 3. Communication between parties showing Movant Father\u2019s inability to exercise his possession of the children during his possession time; 4. Communication between parties showing Movant Father\u2019s inability to keep discussions regarding the children solely on AppClose; 5. Communication between parties showing Movant Father\u2019s continued harassment of Mother that shows a pattern of this treatment throughout the litigation; 6. Mother\u2019s Affidavit; and 7. Mother\u2019s Financial Statement of Income and Expenses.  The amount of evidence provided shows more than a scintilla of evidence to prove these claims because it does more than create a mere suspicion of an existence of fact. This evidence shows patterns of conduct from Movant Father\u2019s that are concerning for the safety of the children the subject of the suit, safety for the Mother, and is proof that Mother\u2019s claims and requested relief\n\nshould be granted at Final Trial.  IV. CONCLUSION  Movant Father\u2019s Motion for No-Evidence Summary Judgment should be denied because he does not accurately state a Motion for No-Evidence Summary Judgment claim.

On January 31, 2024, Mother obtained counsel Cooper L. Carter who filed a First Amended Petition for Divorce and Movant Father filed a First Amended Counterpetition for Divorce via Daniel R. Bacalis, his hired counsel.  On February 1, 2024, the parties attended a hearing for Temporary Orders and Application for Protective Order. At the hearing, both parties had legal representation and were able to come to an agreement as evidenced by the Agreed Associate Judge\u2019s Report for Temporary Orders that was signed by all parties, attorneys, and the Court. Additionally, Temporary Orders were drafted in this proceeding based on the Agreed Associate Judge\u2019s Report for Temporary Orders and were signed by the Court. These Temporary Orders contained orders regarding conservatorship, possession and access, child support, medical support, and temporary division of property and debt, as well as mutual injunctions. Thereafter, Movant Father terminated Mr. Bacalis as his attorney of record and began to represent himself throughout the rest of the litigation proceeding.  On March 14, 2024, the Court heard Movant Father\u2019s Motion to Vacate Temporary Orders and the request was denied by the Court.  On April 24, 2024, Mtoher\u2019s counsel filed a Motion for Pretrial Conference so as to move the case forward and request a Final Trial date.

Movant Father\u2019s requested relief in his Motion for No-Evidence Summary Judgment should be denied in its totality.   II. SUMMARY JUDGEMENT EVIDENCE  Movant Father\u2019s Motion should be denied because the entirety of his Motion is not competent summary judgment evidence (insomuch as it is not support by required filings consistent with the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure).   In the event the Court deems that Movant Father\u2019s summary judgment \u201cevidence\u201d is competent, which is it not, Movant Father\u2019s summary judgment evidence and request is limited in this respect as it does not take into account the significant questions of fact that both Mother and Movant Father\u2019s allege in their respective pleadings.   First, this is not a marriage that solely requires property division. This marriage contains two children that are subject to this suit. In Mother\u2019s current pleadings, Mother alleges that the\n\nappointment of Joint Managing Conservators would not be in the best interest of the children and that she should be appointed as sole managing conservator of the children the subject of the suit upon final orders due to, in part, Movant Father\u2019s history or battery of family violence, child abuse, and/or child neglect and that supervised visitation is required in order to protect the children the subject of this suit. These are genuine issues of material fact that require the Court to hear the matters at hand to make decisions regarding the best interest of the children.  The best intere"}

These are genuine issues of material fact that require the Court to hear the matters at hand to make decisions regarding the best interest of the children.  The best interest of the children shall always be the primary consideration of the court in determining the issues of conservatorship and possession of and access to a child. Texas Family Code Section 153.002. Additionally, the Texas Family Code requires the court to consider evidence of intentional use of abusive physical force, or evidence of sexual abuse committed within a two-year period preceding the filing of the suit or during the suit when making decisions regarding sole or joint conservatorship. Tex. Fam. Code Section 153.004(a).   Regardless, these are genuine questions of material fact involving this proceeding and evidence of this may be shown in the attached exhibits, Mother\u2019s Affidavit attached herein, as well as Mother\u2019s testimony that she plans to give at trial.   Second, there are issues regarding child support and medical support as well as the confirmation of child support arrears that have accumulated during the pendency of this proceeding that are questions of fact needing litigation to decide alongside the Office of the Attorney General.   Third, Mother is also requesting a disproportionate share of property division for various reasons that also raise a question of material facts in this litigation. Mother is requesting a disproportionate share of the property due to the following reasons:  a. Fault in the breakup of the marriage;  b. Benefits the innocent spouse may have derived from the continuation of the marriage;\n\nc. Disparity of earning power of the spouses;  d. Health of the spouses; e. Spouse to whom conservatorship is granted;  f. Needs of the children of the marriage;  g. Education and future employability of the spouses;  h. Community indebtedness and liabilities;  i.

The Movant Father\u2019s Motion should be denied because the evidence of these allegations establishes a genuine issue of material facts that should be litigated at trial.  III. STANDARD OF REVIEW AND ARGUMENT  The Court\u2019s judgment south shall be rendered forthwith if 1. The deposition of transcripts, interrogatory answers, and other discovery responses referenced or set forth in the motion or response, and 2. The pleadings, admissions, affidavits, stipulations of the parties and authenticated or certified public records, if any, on file at the time of the hearing, or filed thereafter and before judgment with permission of the court, show that, except as to the amount of damages, there is no genuine issue as to any material fact. Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 166(c).  In regards to no-evidence summary judgments, a court cannot grant a no-evidence motion for summary judgment if the responding party produces summary judgment evidence that raises a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact. TRCP 166(i). This statute is strictly enforced, and courts have held that a no-evidence motion that lists each element of the plaintiff\u2019s claim and then asserts that the plaintiff has no evidence to support \u201cone or more\u201d or \u201cany of\u201d those elements is insufficient to support summary judgment because this language does not clearly identify which elements, whether some or all, are challenged. Community Health Sys. V. Prof\u2019l Servs. V. Hansen, 525 S.W.3d 671, 695-96(Tex.2017).

In this case, Movant Father has failed to specifically name the claims and elements that Petitioner has supposedly no evidence to support. He simply lists family violence, the existence of a protective order, financial indigence, and temporary orders as the claims that he is asserting Petitioner has no evidence of. However, these listed claims do not match the claims that are asserted by Mother and are not the entirety of Mother\u2019s claims asserted in her First or Second Amended Petition for Divorce.  When a motion for no-evidence summary judgment is filed, the burden does shift to the responding party to present evidence that raises a genuine issue of material fact to the elements specified in the motion. Mack Trucks, Inc. v. Tamez, 206 S.W.3d 572, 581-82 (Tex.2006). This evidence is then reviewed in light favorable to the responding party and against the party bringing the summary judgement. Id. The responding party is required to provide more than a scintilla of evidence in their response for a no-evidence motion for summary judgment to be denied. King Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman, 118 S.W.3d 742, 751 (Tex. 2003).  In this case, there is extensive evidence to prove that there are genuine issues of material fact regarding all issues asserted by the Mother in her pleadings, including but not limited to her claim that joint managing conservatorship would not be in the best interest of the children and that she should be appointed as sole managing conservator, that Movant Father should pay guideline\n\nchild support and medical support and what that amount would be, whether Movant Father committed family violence, child abuse, and/or child neglect, that Mother should be awarded her separate property and what that property is, that Mother should be awarded a disproportionate share of community property, that Mother\u2019s information should remain confidential, and that Mother should be awarded reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and that previous fees and support should be confirmed "}

Evidence of these claims can be found attached to this response herein and includes, but is not limited to:   1. Pleadings on file in this case;  2. Communication between parties during the course of this litigation showing threats that Movant Father has made to Mother; 3. Communication between parties showing Movant Father\u2019s inability to exercise his possession of the children during his possession time; 4. Communication between parties showing Movant Father\u2019s inability to keep discussions regarding the children solely on AppClose; 5. Communication between parties showing Movant Father\u2019s continued harassment of Mother that shows a pattern of this treatment throughout the litigation; 6. Mother\u2019s Affidavit; and 7. Mother\u2019s Financial Statement of Income and Expenses.  The amount of evidence provided shows more than a scintilla of evidence to prove these claims because it does more than create a mere suspicion of an existence of fact. This evidence shows patterns of conduct from Movant Father\u2019s that are concerning for the safety of the children the subject of the suit, safety for the Mother, and is proof that Mother\u2019s claims and requested relief\n\nshould be granted at Final Trial.  IV. CONCLUSION  Movant Father\u2019s Motion for No-Evidence Summary Judgment should be denied because he does not accurately state a Motion for No-Evidence Summary Judgment claim.  Movant Father does not properly assert the elements that he claims Petitioner does not have evidence to support.
