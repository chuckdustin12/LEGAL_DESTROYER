Statement of the Case 
 
Nature of Underlying Proceeding: This original proceeding arises from a divorce 
action, No. 322-744263-23, pending in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County, 
Texas.  
 
Respondent Judge: The Respondent Judge, Honorable James B. Munford, is the 
presiding District Judge of the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County. 
 
Respondent’s Challenged Actions: The relator seeks relief from actions taken by 
District Judge James Munford, who made a significant ruling and then referred this 
matter to Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer— who made subsequent rulings 
including the issuance of temporary orders, the consolidation of a protective order 
with the divorce, and the withdrawal of counsel—on the grounds that these 
subsequent actions were taken without a written order of referral from the district 
judge, thereby rendering them void for lack of jurisdiction.

At the February 1, 2024, setting, Relator’s counsel, Dan Bacalis, presented a 
settlement agreement to which the Relator did not want to sign, but was left with 
no other alternative, and signed the agreement because he noticed specific 
provisions on page 5. MR. D.5. This was filed with the clerk on February 8, 2024. 
MR. D.1. 
6. 
Immediately following this setting, Relator terminated the services of Dan 
Baacalis and proceeded pro-se, and filed an EMERGENCY MOTION TO 
RECONSIDER EVIDENCE AND VACATE TEMPORARY ORDERS on 
February 9, 2024, which included several exhibits and was purposed to expose the 
real party in interest’s scheme to defraud Relator out of his livelihood. MR. E.4. 
7. 
On February 12, 2024, an order for withdraw of attorney Dan Balacis was 
delivered by the Clerk. MR. E.4. 
8. 
On February 27, 2024, a notice of hearing in regard to Relator’s emergency 
motion was signed and filed by District Judge James Munford and the hearing was 
set for March 14, 2024. MR. G.2. 
9. 
On March 14, 2024, alleged counsel for Real Party in Interest, Cooper L.

service. 
10. 
On March 14, 2024, Cooper L. Carter also handed the Relator the reduced 
“Temporary Orders” which falsely claimed consent was given by all of the parties 
and falsely claimed the parties appeared on February 1, 2024, for an alleged 
motion for temporary orders. MR. I.1. 
11. 
Finally, as evidenced by this case’s docket and the legal authorities below, 
all actions above taken by Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer are legally void ab initio 
as the required order of referral was never filed and signed by District Judge James 
Munford when he initially reset the case on January 16, 2024, leading to two years 
of one-sided litigation as the Relator has sought relief in multiple courts without an 
opponent. See cause numbers 02-24-00149-CV, 02-25-00164-CV, 02-25-00166-

and 25-0861.  
12. 
Relator’s efforts to resolve these issues have been in good faith and are in 
the best interests of his minor children involved in this case. Relator understands 
he is a self-represented litigant, but his efforts have been extraordinary and his faith 
in the laws of our State remains to protect him and his children from the manifest 
injustice that has occurred in this case.

II. SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT 
13. 
The necessity of a referral order is not a mere procedural technicality, but a 
jurisdictional requirement. As explained in In re Marriage of D.E.L., the absence of 
a written referral order was argued to render the associate judge’s actions void, and 
the court’s analysis supports the view that the referral order is essential to confer 
authority on the associate judge (In re Marriage of D.E.L., No. 14-17-00216-CV 
(Tex. App. Feb. 12, 2019)). 
14. 
Where an associate judge acts without a valid referral order, their actions are 
generally void. This includes not only substantive rulings but also procedural 
actions such as granting attorney withdrawal. The absence of a referral order 
deprives the associate judge of authority, and party agreement cannot cure this 
jurisdictional defect. 
15. 
Texas Family Code § 201.006 requires the referring court to issue an order 
of referral, and Texas Government Code § 54A.007 similarly mandates a written 
order specifying the associate judge’s duties. These provisions are not framed as 
rights or privileges of the parties that can be waived, but as jurisdictional 
prerequisites imposed on the court itself (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006; Tex. Gov't. 
Code § 54A.007). 
16. 
Therefore, all actions taken by Judge Kaitcer in this matter must be declared 
as void ab initio for lack of an order of referral vesting him with jurisdiction.

generally void. This includes not only substantive rulings but also procedural
actions such as granting attorney withdrawal. The absence of a referral order
deprives the associate judge of authority, and party agreement cannot cure this
jurisdictional defect.
15. Texas Family Code § 201.006 requires the referring court to issue an order
of referral, and Texas Government Code § 54A.007 similarly mandates a written
order specifying the associate judge’s duties. These provisions are not framed as
rights or privileges of the parties that can be waived, but as jurisdictional
prerequisites imposed on the court itself (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006; Tex. Gov't.
Code § 54A.007).
16. Therefore, all actions taken by Judge Kaitcer in this matter must be declared

as void ab initio for lack of an order of referral vesting him with jurisdiction.

III. ARGUMENT 
A.  
Standard of Review 
17. 
The existence and sufficiency of an order of referral is a legal question, not a 
discretionary one. Appellate courts review such questions de novo, meaning they 
make an independent determination without deference to the lower court’s findings 
(In re K.M.H., 14-22-00784-CV (Tex. App. Mar 16, 2023)). Therefore, the standard 
of review for the instant mandamus petition is the de novo standard of review. 
B. 
The Referral Order Requirement Is Jurisdictional and Mandatory 
18. 
The Texas Family Code and Government Code both require a written order of 
referral as a jurisdictional prerequisite for an associate judge to act. Section 201.006 
of the Family Code mandates that the referring judge must render either an individual 
or general order of referral when assigning a case to an associate judge. This is 
echoed in the Government Code, which requires a written order specifying the 
associate judge’s duties (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006; Tex. Gov't. Code § 
54A.007; Tex. Gov't. Code § 54B.007). 
19. 
The record in this case, as detailed in the Statement of Facts and supported by 
the appendix demonstrates that no such written order of referral was ever signed or 
filed by District Judge Munford after the January 16, 2024, incident (Statement of 
Facts ¶ 11). Despite this, Associate Judge Kaitcer presided over multiple hearings, 
issued orders, and made rulings—including denying the relator’s emergency motion

and issuing temporary orders (APP 1, APP 2, APP 3, APP 4, APP 5, APP 6). Under 
the controlling statutes, these actions are void because the associate judge lacked 
authority to act without a written order of referral. 
 C. Actions Taken Without a Valid Order of Referral Are Void Ab Initio 
20. 
The Texas appellate courts have repeatedly held that the absence of a valid 
order of referral deprives the associate judge of authority to act, rendering any orders 
or rulings void ab initio (Mathis v. Graves, No. 01-18-00789-CV (Tex. App. Oct. 31, 
2019); Vara v. Vara, 645 S.W.3d 818 (Tex. App. 2022)). This includes not only 
substantive rulings but also procedural actions such as granting attorney withdrawal 
or consolidating cases. (APP 3, APP 4) 
21. 
In M.B. v. R.B., No. 02-19-00342-CV (Tex. App. Jun. 03, 2021), the court 
emphasized that the Family Code and local rules require a formal order of referral 
for an associate judge to have the authority to render final judgments. Without such 
an order, any actions taken by the associate judge, such as signing a proposed order 
denying an emergency motion or temporary orders, are legally ineffective. (APP 5, 
APP 6) 
22. 
Here, the associate judge’s actions—including the order of withdrawal of 
counsel (APP  4), the agreed order of consolidation (APP 3), and the temporary 
orders (APP  6)—were all taken without a valid order of referral. As such, they are 
void and of no legal effect, regardless of the merits of the underlying dispute.

D. The Defect Is Jurisdictional and Cannot Be Waived or Cured 
23. 
The requirement for a formal order of referral is jurisdictional and cannot be 
waived by the parties or cured by agreement. The Texas Supreme Court and courts 
of appeals have made clear that party consent or acquiescence cannot confer 
authority on an associate judge in the absence of a valid referral order (Office of the 
Attorney Gen. of Tex. v. C.W.H., 531 S.W.3d 178 (Tex. 2017)). Thus, even if the 
parties appeared before the associate judge or failed to object at the time, the orders 
remain void. 
24. 
This principle is critical in the present case, where the relator’s counsel 
presented a settlement agreement and the relator later proceeded pro se, but the 
absence of a referral order cannot be cured by these actions (Statement of Facts ¶ 5, 
6; APP 2, APP 4). 
E. The Absence of a Referral Order Is Not Cured by the Passage of Time or 
Subsequent Proceedings 
25. 
The jurisdictional defect created by the absence of a referral order is not cured 
by the passage of time, subsequent court proceedings, or even the referring court’s 
later adoption of the associate judge’s orders (Mathis v. Graves, No. 01-18-00789-
CV (Tex. App. Oct. 31, 2019)). The defect is fundamental and renders all actions 
taken by the associate judge void ab initio.

26. 
This is particularly significant in this case, where the relator has sought relief 
in multiple courts over a period of nearly two years (Statement of Facts ¶ 11; APP 
10). The ongoing nature of the proceedings does not cure the original jurisdictional 
defect. 
F. Mandamus Relief Is Warranted to Correct Void Orders and Prevent 
Manifest Injustice 
 
27. 
Because the orders issued by Associate Judge Kaitcer are void for lack of 
jurisdiction, mandamus relief is appropriate and necessary. Texas appellate courts 
have repeatedly granted mandamus to correct void orders and prevent manifest 
injustice where a lower court or associate judge has acted without authority (Graham 
v. Graham, 414 S.W.3d 800 (Tex. App. 2013)). 
28. 
The relator has diligently sought relief in multiple courts (Statement of Facts 
¶ 11; APP 10), and to proceed to final trial under these circumstances would 
perpetuate the manifest injustice he has endured, particularly given the impact on his 
parental rights, his business, and the best interests of his minor children. 
G. The Legal Consequences: Orders of Withdrawal and Consolidation Are Void 
29. 
The legal consequences of the absence of a referral order are profound. The 
order of withdrawal of the relator’s prior attorney, Dan Bacalis, is void, arguably 
keeping him as the attorney of record for the relator absent a valid order of 
withdrawal (APP 4). Similarly, the agreed order of consolidation is void, meaning

the protective order remains unconsolidated from the divorce (APP 3). All 
subsequent temporary orders and rulings by the associate judge are likewise void. 
30. 
This procedural morass has resulted in a case that is, in effect, a legal 
quagmire, with significant consequences for the parties and the administration of 
justice, and requires the wisdom of this Court for corrective action. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
31. 
This case exemplifies the chaos and injustice that can result when statutory 
requirements for judicial authority are disregarded. The absence of a written order 
of referral from the district judge to the associate judge is not a mere technicality 
but a jurisdictional defect that renders all actions taken by the associate judge—
including the order of withdrawal, the consolidation order, and subsequent 
temporary orders—void ab initio. As a result, Dan Bacalis remains the attorney of 
record, the protective order is not consolidated with the divorce, and all subsequent 
orders are legally ineffective. 
32. 
The record and appendix confirm the absence of a referral order, and 
controlling statutes and case law leave no doubt that this defect cannot be cured by 
party agreement, subsequent proceedings, or the passage of time. Mandamus relief 
is not only appropriate but essential to restore order, protect the rights of the
