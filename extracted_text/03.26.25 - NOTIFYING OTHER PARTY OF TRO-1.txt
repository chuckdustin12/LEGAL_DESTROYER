Friends on other side,
The Emergency EX-PARTE TRO has been filed and accepted by the court and is awaiting the judge's review. 
If a hearing is required, I will CC Cooper in the email correspondence.
If a hearing is not required, I will serve each of you with a copy of the TRO and proposed order in accordance with the
rules no later than seven days prior to the hearing.
The TRO has the following provisions:
* Respondent is PROHIBITED from preventing Petitioner from entering the matrimonial residence located at 6641
Anne Ct, Watauga, TX 76148.
* Respondent is PROHIBITED from disturbing the peace of the minor children named in this suit.
* Petitioner and Respondent are PROHIBITED from acting without candor towards all members of the household
in the presence of the children.
* Respondent is PROHIBITED from bringing the children in the presence of DAMEN GAULT KAZLAUSKAS.
* Respondent is PROHIBITED from taking the children outside of Tarrant County, Texas.
These provisions, if granted, will be in effect until a full hearing is held no later than 14 days after the order is signed by
the judge.
Once the notice of hearing is served on all parties, I will be filing a motion for pre-trial conference to discuss the Rule 12
motion filed and served last week to ensure those issues are resolved prior to trial. 
At the hearing, the relief I am seeking is to convert the provisions from the TRO into temporary injunctions which will be
the exact same but will ask for them to remain until further order of the court and reset the status quo to March 6, 2024,
which was the last peaceful time enjoyed by all parties prior to the Respondent's unlawful lockout.
If a continuance is needed in order to get your affairs in order for the Rule 12 conference, please reach out as I have no
problem signing an agreed continuance if more time is needed.
I am not seeking sanctions at this time.
If granted, I believe the preceding details suit the best interests of Mara and Caroline, preserves their emotional and
financial well-being, allows myself to repair the substantial damage caused from the prior thirteen months, promotes an
amicable co-parenting relationship, and most importantly upholds Texas Law in ensuring that children have continuous,
frequent access to both parents and that parents are encouraged to work together during and after divorce because
doing so is in their best interests.
I'm not looking to punish, hurt, or ruin anyone. I'm simply looking to do what's best for the kids and start working together
to finish this so we can all move on with our lives.
If you have any suggestions, modifications, or alternative solutions, please feel free to reach out and let me know, or
schedule a time and place to meet in person that best meets your schedule.
Respectfully,
