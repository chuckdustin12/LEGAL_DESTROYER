Good morning,
The Motion to Consolidate just needs to be filed in the 322nd Divorce case and sent to their Judge to sign; no hearing
necessary, it’s a mandatory consolidation.

Ms. Wierzbicki, Mr. Carter,
Thank you for the update. However, I must respectfully object to the assertion that this is a mandatory consolidation.
Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 174(a), consolidation is discretionary and not automatic where doing so would cause
delay, injustice, or prejudice to a party. Additionally, the Texas Supreme Court in Curtis v. Gibbs, 511 S.W.2d 263 (Tex.
1974) expressly carved out exceptions to dominant jurisdiction where:
The original case was filed in bad faith,
The case isn't been prosecuted;
Equity and justice require an independent forum.
All three conditions are present here. The SAPCR was filed in good faith after the 322nd case became procedurally
stalled and legally defective—with no Notice of Remand, no evidentiary rulings on the children, and pending dispositive
motions including unopposed requests for dismissal. 
It would be prejudicial to the children to consolidate a case that had no ability to proceed.
Thank you.
Respectfully,
Charles Dustin Myers
Pro Se Petitioner

Hello, 
This is Charles Dustin Myers, Petitioner in the above captioned cause, and I received an automated reply deferring me to
this email when originally reaching out to the Honorable Coordinator.
The original email's purpose was to inform the Honorable Coordinator that I had just received notification through the EFM
that the emergency ex-parte TRO had been accepted by the court.
I am following up to inquire about the status of the request.
I thank you for your attention to this urgent matter, and I will wait for further directive from the court to proceed accordingly.
As mentioned in the motion, the Respondent in this matter and her counsel of record have been duly notified of the relief
being sought and the motion itself, but have not responded to any attempts to communicate regarding this urgent matter.
Thank you and have a wonderful evening.

Good Evening,
I have received communication from opposing party who is pro se that he will be walking through an Emergency TRO.
Our office has a hearing scheduled for tomorrow morning in Parker County and is unable to attend. However, I will be
available by cell phone regarding this matter if the Judge would like to speak to me regarding the Emergency TRO.
Please contact our office to patch me in for any calls that Judge would like to have.
Additionally, this case already is pending in the 322nd for a divorce proceeding regarding property and children matters.
We will be consolidating the case and walking it through the 322nd for signature next week.

Court staff,
Ms. Carter’s recent correspondence is improper for several reasons, and appears to be an attempt to delay or interfere
with proceedings in which she has otherwise failed to meaningfully participate in. The following reasons support this
statement:
1. An objection to consolidation is already on file and remains unopposed. It cites controlling Texas precedent. Any
suggestion that consolidation is agreed upon or inevitable is misleading. Instead, she should properly file with the court
why the consolidation is improper or at the very least argue against Petitioner's position.
2. Ms. Carter has not fulfilled her obligation under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 237a to file a Notice of Remand. Until
she does, she is prohibited from proceeding or filing anything in the 322nd District Court as they currently do not have
jurisdiction over this matter until this obligation is fulfilled.
3. Her authority to represent the Respondent remains under challenge pursuant to a Rule 12 motion filed September 20,
2024. No hearing has been held, no written statement of authority has been filed, and no ruling has been made. Until
resolved, Rule 12 bars her from participating in either proceeding.
4. Ms. Carter has not prosecuted the case in the 322nd District Court in over eight months. This inaction has prejudiced
the Petitioner and delayed resolution of urgent matters affecting the children.
5. She has failed to file any objections, responsive pleadings, or legal arguments opposing the relief requested—including
the Emergency TRO now pending.
6. Rather than reaching out to Petitioner to resolve any scheduling conflict, Ms. Carter improperly attempted to influence
the court by email. This violates the spirit of cooperation required by the rules, particularly where her participation is
procedurally barred.
7. Ms. Carter’s conduct appears designed to delay relief and subvert the best interest of the children, despite her failure to
oppose the requested relief in any meaningful way.
8. She has been provided with full notice of the Emergency TRO, the proposed order, supporting exhibits, and the time
and location of presentment. She has no legal basis to subvert Petitioner's due process rights.
In summary, Ms. Carter has not provided anything of substance in either Court, has not prosecuted the case, has not
argued on behalf of her client, or followed proper procedure.
Simply labeling the opposition as pro se and claiming that the consolidation will be filed without disclosing the above facts
is dishonest and should not be permitted as it will only cause further unnecessary delays to the relief being sought without
any substance being provided.
Again, all of these points have been argued in both courts, and it is her duty as counsel to handle these matters in
accordance with Texas Law.
These matters should be handled between the parties - not attempt to influence court staff after hours.
The reason we are here in the first place is due to the above unanswered facts. Ms. Carter has had ample time to file an
objection, response, or counter argument, but has chosen not to do so.
It would've been far more appropriate for Ms. Carter to have reached out to me directly to discuss scheduling conflicts.
Prior to the latest email, there was no indication Ms. Carter intended to participate at all despite being provided with all
relevant materials.

7. Ms. Carter’s conduct appears designed to delay relief and subvert the best interest of the children, despite her failure to
oppose the requested relief in any meaningful way.

8. She has been provided with full notice of the Emergency TRO, the proposed order, supporting exhibits, and the time
and location of presentment. She has no legal basis to subvert Petitioner's due process rights.

In summary, Ms. Carter has not provided anything of substance in either Court, has not prosecuted the case, has not
argued on behalf of her client, or followed proper procedure.

Simply labeling the opposition as pro se and claiming that the consolidation will be filed without disclosing the above facts
is dishonest and should not be permitted as it will only cause further unnecessary delays to the relief being sought without

any substance being provided. SUPP 2 21

Again, all of these points have been argued in both courts, and it is her duty as counsel to handle these matters in
accordance with Texas Law.
These matters should be handled between the parties - not attempt to influence court staff after hours.
The reason we are here in the first place is due to the above unanswered facts. Ms. Carter has had ample time to file an
objection, response, or counter argument, but has chosen not to do so.
It would've been far more appropriate for Ms. Carter to have reached out to me directly to discuss scheduling conflicts.
Prior to the latest email, there was no indication Ms. Carter intended to participate at all despite being provided with all

The court should disregard this email correspondence in its entirety for the reasons stated herein as it is highly prejudicial

Good morning,
Mr. Myers appeared before me to schedule the hearing for the TRO; my apologies I did not realize this was that
same case.  We can go ahead and set the TRO with us, but most likely the case will be transferred prior to the
hearing date and the case needs to be transferred prior to that date.
Mr. Myers will be emailing with dates available for the hearing.

SUMMARY 
Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, respectfully submits this Motion to Dismiss for 
Want of Prosecution and in support thereof states as follows: 
1. The Supreme Court of Texas, through its promulgated time standards, provides clear
guidelines for the timely disposition of cases, including dissolution of marriage.
2. The proposed time standards are based on national studies, including those conducted by
the ABA and the NCSC, which establish a 12-month maximum time frame for divorce
cases as achievable and reasonable, with intermediate standards for temporary orders,
responsive pleadings, and trials.
3. In this case, the time standards have been exceeded, with no substantial progress toward
resolution or final disposition.
4. Rule 165a (2) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure permits the dismissal of cases that
are not disposed of within the prescribed time standards, ensuring the proper
administration of justice and preventing undue delays caused by party inaction.
FACTS SUPPORTING DISMISSAL 
5. Notwithstanding the above, the Petitioner’s Original Petition for Divorce in this matter
and all subsequent pleadings submitted to the court bearing her signature should be
stricken from the record because they are fundamentally fraudulent, and given the
circumstances of the case, the Petitioner cannot prevail at trial, and granting a divorce
under the current circumstances would prove detrimental to the Respondent, and the
children.
6. The Petitioner’s submissions include an affidavit of inability to pay, an original divorce
petition, and a protective order. These documents were leveraged to secure the current

5. Notwithstanding the above, the Petitioner’s Original Petition for Divorce in this matter
and all subsequent pleadings submitted to the court bearing her signature should be

temporary orders which claim to be agreed despite lacking the Respondent’s signature 
and were prepared by an attorney not authorized to represent the Petitioner. 
7. The Respondent has raised claims of fraud, perjury, deception, and child neglect against
the Petitioner, and her counsel has failed to address, defend, or file any response
regarding these claims.
8. The Respondent has submitted discovery and admissions which have not been responded
to by the opposing party, and despite filing a motel to compel discovery, no action has
been taken by the court.
9. The opposing counsel’s authority has been under challenge pursuant to Rule 12 of the
Texas Rules of Civil Procedure since September 20th, 2024, yet she was permitted to
attend the recusal hearing and raise objections despite no indication of her position on the
motion prior to the hearing.
10. The opposing counsel is unable to file anything on her client’s behalf in this matter
because her electronic filing manager account is registered under her former employer’s
email.
11. The opposing counsel has not filed any documents on her client’s behalf in this matter but
has rather had individuals unrelated to the case file documents for her on her behalf.
12. The opposing counsel is unable to file the required notice of remand with the clerk of the
court, and the case is unable to proceed given these circumstances.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
13. Petitioner knowingly made and presented fraudulent claims to the Court regarding
Respondent's property, with the intent to deprive him of his interest in his home, a
property essential for his ability to work and provide for the children.
14. Petitioner acted with the intent that these false claims be given the same legal effect as
valid court orders, misleading the Court and causing Respondent to be wrongfully
deprived of his home and livelihood.
15. The Respondent, as the person directly affected by this fraudulent conduct, reserves the
right to bring a cause of action under Sec. 12.003(a)(8) as an equal owner to the
community property impacted by the Petitioner’s fraudulent claims.
16. Petitioner’s actions have caused significant harm, including:
1. Financial injury resulting from the loss of property and work opportunities.
2. Mental anguish and emotional distress caused by being deprived of his home
and stability.
17. Given the Petitioner is unable to account for the damages she has caused, the court should
impose the appropriate sanctions for the following reasons:
i.
For signing multiple fraudulent documents which she knew to be false,
including the affidavit of inability to pay and original petition for divorce
filed December 18, 2023, the Application for Protective Order filed
December 22, 2023, and the current temporary orders prepared by her

The Respondent, as the person directly affected by this fraudulent conduct, reserves the

Petitioner’s actions have caused significant harm, including:

Given the Petitioner is unable to account for the damages she has caused, the court should

ii. For failing to take her court-ordered parenting class, which permits the
court to issue an appropriate sanction pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code §
105.009(g).
iii. For putting her own selfish agenda before her own children’s future and
emotional stability , disregarding them entirely
iv. For any other actions or inaction taken by the Petitioner in this matter.
CONCLUSION AND PRAYER 
18. In conclusion, this case should be dismissed as a matter of law. It has yet to be
adjudicated fairly in over a year, exceeding the Texas Supreme Court guidelines. It further was 
founded on fraud, including an affidavit of inability to pay, making the case dismissible pursuant 
to the Tex. Prac. Rem. Code Sec. 13.001. Finally, given the fundamentally flawed decisions 
made in this case in regard to the children – the current situation damages their well-being, and a 
re-assessment of the facts are needed for the court to properly adjudicate this matter. 
Therefore, the respondent respectfully requests that this honorable court: 
i.
Dismiss this case without prejudice and impose the appropriate sanctions on
the Petitioner.
ii. Adopt the emergency temporary orders filed by the Respondent in September
of 2024 which reflect the reality of the current situation and preserves the
status quo of the children in accordance with Texas law.
iii. Provide clear, written instructions in the dismissal order permitting the
Respondent to return to 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, TX giving the Petitioner

to the Tex. Prac. Rem. Code Sec. 13.001. Finally, given the fundamentally flawed decisions
made in this case in regard to the children — the current situation damages their well-being, and a
re-assessment of the facts are needed for the court to properly adjudicate this matter.

Therefore, the respondent respectfully requests that this honorable court:

i. Dismiss this case without prejudice and impose the appropriate sanctions on
the Petitioner.

ii. Adopt the emergency temporary orders filed by the Respondent in September
of 2024 which reflect the reality of the current situation and preserves the
status quo of the children in accordance with Texas law.

iii. Provide clear, written instructions in the dismissal order permitting the

Respondent to return to 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, TX giving the Petitioner

the choice to either co-habitat or live next-door while the Respondent repairs 
the significant damage caused by her actions. 
iv. Give the Respondent sole managing custody of the children and exclusive use
of the residency while the case is pending.
v. Require that the Petitioner provide the documents requested that will allow the
court to establish child support payments for the children and require that the
Petitioner make these payments to aid in the rebuilding process for the
Children.
vi. Require a response to be filed by the opposing party within the next ten days.
vii. Provide any further relief that the court finds just and equitable given the
unusual circumstances of this matter.
