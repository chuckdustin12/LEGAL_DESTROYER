application or order and the other party was the respondent or defendant of
an action regarding the conduct alleged in the application or order without
regard to the date of the order.  If a copy of the order is not available at the
time of filing, the petition must state that a copy of the order will be filed
with the court before any hearing. – Id (emphasis added)

a.
Daniel Kenneth Branthoover has impersonated a public
servant by presenting himself as an attorney and performed
legal acts without a license such as requesting discovery,
advising Morgan Michelle Myers to transfer the available
funds in the marital estate to herself, directly influenced the
pleadings in this case, and has caused significant and
ongoing harm on the Children and the Respondent in this
case. “A person commits an offense if they impersonate a
public servant with intent to induce another to submit to their
pretended official authority or to rely on their pretended
official acts. This offense is a felony of the third degree.”
Texas Penal Code § 37.11.
b. Morgan Michelle Myers knowingly and willingly filed
fraudulent divorce paperwork under the advice of Daniel
Branthoover “with intent to deceive and with knowledge of
the statement's meaning” when claiming an active order of
protection existed against the Respondent for the purpose of
acquiring property as well as when filing for a protective
order to achieve the same goal. Texas Penal Code § 32.32(b).
The goal was to gain an advantage in the divorce suit by
leveraging knowingly false statements of family violence
and by creating a false narrative of protection. An affidavit of
inability to pay was claimed despite both Daniel and Morgan

a.

Daniel Kenneth Branthoover has impersonated a public
servant by presenting himself as an attorney and performed
legal acts without a license such as requesting discovery,
advising Morgan Michelle Myers to transfer the available
funds in the marital estate to herself, directly influenced the
pleadings in this case, and has caused significant and
ongoing harm on the Children and the Respondent in this
case. “A person commits an offense if they impersonate a
public servant with intent to induce another to submit to their
pretended official authority or to rely on their pretended
official acts. This offense is a felony of the third degree.”
Texas Penal Code § 37.11.

Morgan Michelle Myers knowingly and willingly filed
fraudulent divorce paperwork under the advice of Daniel
Branthoover “with intent to deceive and with knowledge of
the statement's meaning” when claiming an active order of
protection existed against the Respondent for the purpose of
acquiring property as well as when filing for a protective
order to achieve the same goal. Texas Penal Code § 32.32(b).
The goal was to gain an advantage in the divorce suit by
leveraging knowingly false statements of family violence
and by creating a false narrative of protection. An affidavit of

inability to pay was claimed despite both Daniel and Morgan

admitting via text evidence that Morgan had transferred 
money to herself just three days prior on December 15th, 
2024. 
c.
Both Morgan Michelle Myers and Daniel Kenneth
Branthoover knowingly and willingly committed acts of
perjury. The perjury occurred when they conspired to
transfer joint finances to Morgan through Daniel’s PayPal
account and immediately following this act proceeded to file
for divorce swearing an affidavit of inability to pay costs and
that an active order of protection existed against the
Respondent. This affidavit was made under oath with the
intent to deceive the court regarding her financial status, a
clear violation of Texas Penal Code § 37.02(a)(1).
VIII. CONCLUSION
32. The actions taken by Morgan Michelle Myers and Daniel Kenneth
Branthoover are not only legally reprehensible but also morally
indefensible. Their calculated scheme to remove the Respondent, a
dedicated stay-at-home father, from the lives of his children has
caused significant disruption. By conspiring to fraudulently transfer
joint finances, filing a deceitful affidavit of inability to pay costs,
and manipulating legal processes through perjury and
impersonation, they have engaged in a toxic and egregious civil

children of this case for the sole benefit of Morgan Michelle Myers. 
33. The Respondent has been the primary caregiver for his children,
providing them with emotional support and stability. The deliberate
efforts of Morgan and Daniel to sever this vital relationship have
disrupted the children's lives, depriving them of the love and care
they rely on, and the financial support they have enjoyed. This
malicious intent to manipulate the court and inflict harm on Charles
and his children cannot continue to be overlooked.
34. While Margie Evonne Wilson's actions contributed to the harm
caused, it is important to acknowledge that the Respondent does not
believe her intent was driven by malice. The Respondent believes
Margie was manipulated and placed in a difficult position by
Morgan. Her inclusion into the case is necessary for the relief being
sought regarding the preservation of the property and has expressed
shared concerns regarding the Children.
35. Given the severity of these actions, it is imperative that this Court
take decisive action. The Respondent respectfully requests that the
Court grant the relief sought, enjoin the responsible third parties,
and if deemed necessary - forward the information regarding the
criminal violations to the appropriate state prosecutors for further
investigation regarding Daniel Branthoover’s actions. The well-

Background Report for Case Consolidation

Case Details:

Divorce Case (Cause No. 322-744263-23) in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County, filed on
December 18, 2023.

Protective Order Case (Cause No. 322-744538-23) in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County.

Reasons for Consolidation:

Interconnected Issues:

The divorce case and the protective order case involve overlapping issues concerning family violence
allegations, which are central to the divorce proceedings and directly affect custody and visitation rights.
The protective order case includes allegations of family violence, which are also a pivotal point in the
divorce case in determining the waiver of the standard waiting period for the divorce.

Consistency in Rulings:

Consolidating the divorce and protective order cases would ensure consistency in the court's findings,
particularly regarding any allegations of family violence and their impact on the dissolution of marriage,
custody, and visitation rights.

Judicial Economy:

Hearing both cases together would promote judicial economy by avoiding duplication of legal
proceedings, as both cases are likely to involve similar witnesses, evidence, and legal arguments.

Claims of False Statements:

There have been claims of false statements and perjury related to the protective order, which could have
significant implications for the divorce case. For instance, the claim that the plaintiff intentionally lied
about being unable to pay court fees and made false allegations of family violence to gain an advantage
in the divorce proceedings suggests that a single judge should hear both matters for a clear
understanding of the facts.

--- OCR TEXT ---
Evidence of Misrepresentation and False Statements:

Evidence provided suggests that there have been misrepresentations to the court, including the transfer
of funds from the joint account and the plaintiff's interaction with third parties, which could affect both
the protective order and the divorce outcome. The protective order — which was based on claims of
family violence — are entirely baseless as | have no record of family violence, and no evidence from the
Plaintiff has been provided to substantiate these claims.

Landlord-Tenant Relationship:

The eviction case, although not directly related to family law matters, stems from claims and actions that
are deeply intertwined with the divorce and protective order cases, suggesting that the alleged family
violence and the actions of the plaintiff have been used to justify an eviction that coincides with the
timing of the divorce and protective order filings.

Conclusion:

Given the overlapping factual and legal issues in the divorce and protective order cases, consolidation
would serve the interests of justice and efficiency. It would ensure that the court has a comprehensive
understanding of the intertwined nature of the family's circumstances, which is vital for fair and
equitable resolution of these matters. While the eviction case may not be directly consolidated due to
jurisdictional differences, it should be considered in context with the other cases to provide a complete
picture of the ongoing disputes and to keep the best interests of our children intact.
