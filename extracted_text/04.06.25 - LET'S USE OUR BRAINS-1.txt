Let's all use our brains here for a second.
The kids are suffering irreparable harm. You have nothing to say for yourselves here.
You haven't prosecuted the case. Nothing to say here either.
You pretend like you can't see the same docket I can, and pretend like the case was never removed to federal court.
You've waived any possibility of arguing for dominant jurisdiction in the 322nd District Court by answering the SAPCR.
You rushed to answer a suit claiming it was to harass and cause unnecessary delay, only to then hi-jack an emergency
TRO hearing without even being present in the courtroom.
This maneuver came without any response to the TRO, and came after the hearing date was agreed upon set for April
10th.
You don't reply to any emails, discovery requests, respond to motions, provide any evidence, and if it weren't for the
SAPCR being opened, there was never any indication that the case would move towards final trial notwithstanding the
procedural obligations which still must be resolved.
After zealously coming to prevent emergency relief, you then notify me that you'll be 'walking the consolidation motion that
you filed in the 322nd for signature' on Friday, 04/04/2025.
You then contact the court coordinator, who prioritizes this motion over everything else on the docket, and instead of
realizing this, she incorrectly reiterates her duties to me and then proceeds to set the hearing, which you suddenly
become unavailable to participate in until late April.
You've allowed your client to live a delusion for over a year, going as far as to psychologically manipulate her own children
into believing her relationship is proper, and tell them that the divorce is final to justify herself in front of the kids.
None of her family will testify on her behalf - only her delusive co-conspirators. 
She thinks getting a job paying her 50-60k per year makes up for the familial bond she disregarded and the damages that
continue to accrue.
You leave a paper trail for all of the above that has been meticulously documented over the last year.
You've underestimated your opponent, who has said from the very beginning is willing to work together for the interests of
the kids, but you continue to double down, triple down, and now quadruple down on this procedural embarrassment that
you have no plausible way to litigate or talk your way out of.
It's almost as if there's this illusion that somehow talking this through with me would be worse than the consequences that
would be faced in a court of law, with a record, where there will be cross examination, witnesses subpoenaed to court that
need to be there, depositions taken from the players in this game who have remained behind the scenes.
I'll be hitting four simultaneous courts this week across the Texas Judiciary, and I'm putting both courts on notice with an
intent to file petition for writ of mandamus in the 233rd, and an intent to file a writ of prohibition in the 322nd.
I'm not in over my head, this is not a game to me, and I'm following the law. This is not some denial of reality, it's not some
vindictive attempt to overturn an unfavorable outcome.
This is simply going to be the most unprecedented breakdown of justice ever captured in recent Texas History, and
underneath it all is one of the most vindictive, selfish parents who has been hiding away like a hermit as if she will get

away with this.
A mother who tore apart her own children's lives to be with someone she had already chosen well before the divorce. A
mother who can benefit from someone's hard work and efforts, yet discards him at the most opportunistic moment and
has nothing to say for herself. Living in a delusion, poisoning the minds of our children, and offering nothing in the form of
co-parenting. 
It's truly a tragedy, and to top it all off - dumps the kids on her grandparents - something that this same woman refused to
even consider. The woman who took the foundation of our family, convinced me that she wanted to leave that "cursed
house" only to then yank it out from under me right before I got to the finish line.
It's sickening to say the least, but that goes without saying.
You can use my messages against me, but they do nothing but speak the truth. You both are silent because you both are
guilty, and the record clearly establishes that.
There is no amount of evidence or justification that you could ever conjure to justify what has occurred within the last 14
months in counting.
I stand behind every word I've said, and every argument I've raised.
I'm not out for blood, I'm out for justice.
The choice to use your brain is on you.
You know my intent, and will be served with the notices tomorrow.
Have a good evening,
Charlie
