IN THE MATTER

OF THE MARRIAGE OF
MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS
AND CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS
NOTICE
AND IN THE INTEREST OF MARA
MYERS AND CAROLINE MYERS,
CHILDREN

Respondent submits this notice in good faith regarding the joint motion for recusal
filed on October 7, 2024. Continuous procedural abnormalities continue to occur without
explanation, which raises further questions regarding the integrity of this case in the

current venue.

Given the severity of the situation involving the Respondent and his family,

particularly his children, this notice points out the following concerning abnormalities:

I. DISCREPANCIES IN FILING

1. The Respondent filed his Joint Motion for Recusal with the court on October 7,
2024, but it has yet to be docketed on the reSearchTX platform. The file, which was
tabbed, indexed, and hyperlinked for convenience, had a size of 19.3 MB at the time of
submission. The Respondent received a receipt confirming acceptance of the filing on

October 7, 2024, at 10:46 a.m. (Exhibit A).

2. On October 8, 2024, the Respondent received an email from the Court 
Coordinator, Ms. Lindsey Baker, confirming Judge James Munford’s decision to refer the 
case to the Regional Presiding Judge, David Evans. The email included an Order of 
Referral, signed by Judge Munford on October 8, 2024 (Exhibit B). 
 
3. Upon reviewing the email, the Respondent noticed that the attached Motion to 
Recuse was missing crucial elements, specifically the affidavit and accompanying 
exhibits. Additionally, the tabs and hyperlinks were no longer present. The Respondent 
raised these discrepancies with Ms. Baker, who confirmed that the motion had been filed 
with the exhibits, despite the Respondent not receiving any indication of this in the 
receipt provided. 
 
4. Dissatisfied with the response, the Respondent pointed out that the file size of 
the motion submitted on October 7, 2024, and the one sent via email differed 
significantly. It appeared that an unverified and modified version of the motion had been 
forwarded to Judge Evans (Exhibit B). 
5. On the morning of October 9, 2024, the Respondent received the Order of 
Referral and correspondence to Judge Evans at 10:39 a.m., which still contained the 
same discrepancies noted earlier (Exhibits C and D).

same discrepancies noted earlier (Exhibits C and D).

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
6. At 12:17 p.m. on the same day, Ms. Baker sent further correspondence stating: 
“Attached is correspondence from Judge Munford to Judge Evans and an 
Amended Order of Referral. 
Due to the length of the Joint Motion to Recusal, it is being sent as three 
attachments. Thank you.” Exhibit E 
  
Despite this explanation, the Amended Order of Referral has not been filed on the 
reSearchTX platform, raising additional concerns regarding the handling of the original 
motion. The reasoning provided for splitting the motion into three attachments only arose 
after the file size discrepancy was highlighted, and there is still no confirmation that the 
correct version of the motion was forwarded to Judge Evans or exists within the official 
case file. 
II. THE RESEARCH TX PLATFORM  
7. The reasoning given by Ms. Baker regarding the file size raises further 
questions. According to the District Clerk’s e-filing frequently asked questions (FAQs), 
attached as Exhibit F, the following guidelines are provided: 
Q: Do you want all exhibits uploaded as separate documents or merged into one 
document? 
A: Merged into one document. 
 
 
 
Q: Should any exhibits be submitted as attachments to petition or as 
separate filing?

Il. THE RESEARCH TX PLATFORM

7. The reasoning given by Ms. Baker regarding the file size raises further
questions. According to the District Clerk’s e-filing frequently asked questions (FAQs),

attached as Exhibit F, the following guidelines are provided:

Q: Do you want all exhibits uploaded as separate documents or merged into one
document?

A: Merged into one document.

Q: Should any exhibits be submitted as attachments to petition or as

separate filing?


=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
A: Exhibits should be merged into the lead document for a single filing. 
 
 
Q: Exhibits – Are these uploaded as attachments to the petition. If yes, do you 
want them uploaded singly or do you want all the exhibits combined into a single 
document? 
A: Preference is to have exhibits as part of the lead document they are filing, 
as long as they don't exceed the 35mb per envelope size limit. Lead 
documents get file-marked; attachments do not get file marked. 
 
The Respondent’s original motion complied with these guidelines, as the total file size 
was well below the 35 MB limit. However, despite this, the court opted to split the 
document into three parts. Additionally, the docket still shows that neither the original 
motion to recuse nor the subsequent correspondence or amended order from Judge 
Munford have been properly filed or docketed. 
8. Pursuant to the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended by Misc. Docket 
No. 13-9165 from the Texas Supreme Court,  
“[e]very pleading, plea, motion, or application to the court for an order, whether in the 
form of a motion, plea, or other form of request, unless presented during a hearing or 
trial, must be filed with the clerk of the court in writing, must state the grounds therefor, 
must set forth the relief or order sought, and at the same time a true copy must be served 
on all other parties, and must be noted on the docket.” TEX. R. CIV. P. 21a

on all other parties, and must be noted on the docket.” TEX. R. CIV. P. 21a


=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
9. Given that a true copy of the Amended Order of Referral has not been filed or 
docketed as required by Rule 21a, and in light of the contradictions between the court 
coordinator’s explanation and the FAQs, the Respondent respectfully raises these 
concerns. The Respondent further requests clarification from the Court regarding the 
purpose of modifying the document in a manner that causes it to appear as an unverified 
pleading, which is fatal to the motion. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 18a(a)(1). 
CONCLUSION 
The Respondent respectfully requests that the Court take immediate corrective 
action to ensure that all filings, including the Amended Order of Referral, are properly 
docketed in accordance with Rule 21a and that all parties, including the Respondent, have 
full and equal access to the court’s records and filings. The Respondent remains 
committed to complying with all applicable rules and procedures and looks forward to 
the Court's timely resolution of these issues to preserve the faith and integrity of the 
judiciary.

Dear Lindsay Baker,
I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you that my Motion to Recuse, referenced in your message, may
have been forwarded without the attached exhibits and affidavits that are critical to the motion.
The exhibits and affidavits provide necessary evidence and support for my claims, and it is important that the court has
access to the full record. Could you please confirm whether these documents were received with my motion? It raises
further concern that they are missing.
Please let me know the appropriate process to ensure that these documents are added to the court’s record. Thank you
for your attention to this matter.

Dear Ms. Baker,
Thank you for your response, and would just ask for some clarification on a couple of things.
There are noticable discrepancies between the file I submitted, accepted and available on the reSearchTX platform versus
what appears in the court's receipt to the Regional Judge. My original submission was 20.21 MB, while the version in the
courts email is 423 KB. Additionally, my receipt provides no indication that the exhibits were filed alongside the motion,
particularly the affidavit, which is referenced in the table of contents.
The document I submitted was also hyperlinked, but those links are missing in the court’s receipt.
Could you please clarify which court system the file is currently in and explain for what purpose the file was modified to
appear as if it were an unverified motion? 
I would appreciate your prompt attention to this matter at your earliest convenience.
Best regards,
Charles Myers

Orders-
Family Law  
Couple of options: 1) Attorneys can take their applications and orders straight to the Judge to 
be filed and signed.  It is mandatory that you immediately deliver the originals  
(pleading/order) to the Clerk of the Court so that the Clerk retains the originals and it can be 
entered into JIMS.  or  2)  E-file the application/motion -(after knowing what court the case is 
assigned) go to that Court Clerk to get the docket sheet and then go to the Court with your 
proposed order.  Once the order is signed the attorney will bring back the docket sheet and 
order to the Court clerk to be processed.     
Filing TRO's or  
Protective Orders- Civil 
Law  
Couple of options: 1) If you choose to process the TRO in person, you should e-file the 
pleading and bring in your proposed order.  2) - If you choose to E-file everything, submit 
your pleading as a lead document and your proposed order as an attachment.  The clerks will 
print out and send to the court; once the order is signed the clerk will email you the signed 
order for you to process accordingly.

efiled and all other processes after the filing remain the same.   NOTICE- Use caution when 
"pre paying" for a TRO notice, just in case the Judge will not sign the order. The refund 
process is time consuming.  
How will petitions be 
served if service is 
needed in Tarrant 
County?

information link. The form must be completed, printed, scanned, and e-filed as a PDF.
