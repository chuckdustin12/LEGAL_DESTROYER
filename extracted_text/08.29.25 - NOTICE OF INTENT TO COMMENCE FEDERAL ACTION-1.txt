TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THIS COURT:

Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, respectfully submits this notice
of intent to commence a federal action for the persistent, willful violation of his
constitutionally protected right to a fair and impartial tribunal, for the refusal to
adjudicate critical issues that have remained unopposed on the record, the
continued involvement of the Court Coordinator in recusal proceedings, and the
continued favoritism exhibited towards the opposing side.

I. Summary

1. A federal court suit is appropriate where a court coordinator repeatedly

and clearly acts outside statutory authority in recusal proceedings, because the ultra

vires exception to sovereign immunity allows for prospective injunctive relief

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
against state officials whose unauthorized conduct threatens federally protected 
rights, such as due process.  
 
2. A federal court suit is even more strongly warranted here because the 
repeated, unauthorized involvement of the court coordinator in recusal proceedings 
is compounded by grave due process violations—such as removal from the home 
and children without a hearing, the rendition of unsigned and unreviewed orders, 
and persistent judicial errors—demonstrating a pattern of ultra vires conduct that 
threatens the fundamental federal rights of the Respondent. These circumstances 
elevate the case from a mere procedural irregularity to a situation where federal 
intervention is necessary to protect constitutional guarantees and the integrity of 
the judicial process. 
 
3. Federal intervention is justified not only because the court coordinator’s 
repeated involvement in recusal proceedings is unauthorized under Texas law, but 
also because the cumulative effect of the described judicial and administrative 
misconduct—including removal from the home without a hearing, enforcement of 
defective orders, and disregard for due process—amounts to a substantial and 
ongoing deprivation of constitutional rights. The ultra vires exception to sovereign 
immunity, as recognized in Texas and federal law, allows for prospective injunctive 
relief against state officials whose actions are wholly unauthorized and result in a

real or imminent threat to federally protected rights, such as the right to due 
process and family integrity. 
 
4. Given the exhaustion of state remedies, the lack of meaningful judicial 
response, and the presence of additional factors such as alleged racketeering and 
harm to children caused by the Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, the case 
presents a compelling scenario for federal court intervention. The coordinator’s 
actions, administrative and not protected by quasi-judicial immunity, and the 
broader pattern of judicial irregularities, together create an urgent need for federal 
relief to restore the rule of law and protect the respondent’s constitutional interests. 
II. Background and Relevant Law 
A. Legislative and Regulatory Framework 
 
5. Texas law is explicit in reserving the authority to handle recusal motions 
to the presiding judge of the administrative judicial region. Section 25.00255 of the 
Texas Government Code provides that only the presiding judge may hear or assign 
a judge to hear a referred motion for recusal or disqualification, and the statute is 
silent as to any role for a court coordinator in this process. This omission is 
significant, as it means that any involvement by a court coordinator in recusal 
proceedings is not authorized and is therefore ultra vires—beyond the scope of 
their lawful authority (Tex. Gov't. Code § 25.00255).

6. The Texas Administrative Code further requires that a motion to recuse be 
verified, state particular grounds, and be based on personal knowledge, and only 
upon the filing of such a motion do the procedural requirements for recusal arise (1 
Tex. Admin. Code § 155.152). Again, there is no provision for a court coordinator 
to act in this context. 
 
7. Court coordinators’ duties are defined by local administrative rules and 
are intended to support the efficient administration of justice, but the statute does 
not grant them authority to participate in judicial functions such as recusal 
proceedings (Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.102). 
 
8. Federal law, specifically 42 U.S.C. § 1983, allows for suits against state 
officials who, under color of state law, deprive individuals of federal rights. Judges 
and certain judicial functionaries enjoy absolute immunity for judicial acts, but 
only qualified immunity for administrative acts (Claims Under 42 U.S.C. Section 
1983 (2016)). Quasi-judicial immunity may extend to court staff if their actions are 
integral to the judicial process, but not if their conduct is purely administrative and 
unauthorized (B.K. v. Cox, 116 S.W.3d 351 (Tex. App. 2003)).

III. Analysis
B. The Ultra Vires Exception and Exhaustion of State Remedies
9. The ultra vires doctrine provides a clear pathway for challenging the

actions of state officials who act outside their legal authority. Texas courts have

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
repeatedly held that sovereign immunity does not bar suits seeking prospective 
injunctive relief against officials whose conduct is unauthorized (City of El Paso v. 
Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d 366 (Tex. 2009); Matzen v. McLane, 659 S.W.3d 381 (Tex. 
2021); PermiaCare v. L.R.H., 600 S.W.3d 431 (Tex. App. 2020)). The key 
requirement is that the plaintiff must allege and ultimately prove that the official 
acted without legal authority or failed to perform a purely ministerial act 
(Shamrock Psychiatric Clinic, P.A. v. Tex. Dep't of Health & Human Servs., 540 
S.W.3d 553 (Tex. 2018)). 
 
10. Here, the coordinator’s repeated involvement in the recusal process, 
despite the absence of statutory authority, is a textbook example of ultra vires 
conduct. The Texas Government Code and case law make clear that only judges, 
not coordinators, have authority in recusal matters (Tex. Gov't. Code § 
25.00255; In re Alpert, 276 S.W.3d 592 (Tex. App. 2008)). The coordinator’s 
actions are not a matter of discretion, but a clear departure from statutory limits. 
 
11. The exhaustion of state remedies, including multiple unsuccessful 
mandamus petitions, further supports the appropriateness of federal intervention. 
While mandamus is an extraordinary remedy available only when there is a clear 
right to relief and no other adequate legal remedy (see In re McAllen Medical 
Center, Inc., 275 S.W.3d 458 (Tex. 2008)), the repeated denial of such relief does 
not preclude a federal suit if a federal right is at stake.

C. Judicial and Quasi-Judicial Immunity 
 
12. A significant obstacle to federal relief is the doctrine of judicial and 
quasi-judicial immunity. Judges are absolutely immune from suit for judicial acts, 
except when acting in the clear absence of all jurisdiction. See Luttrell v. El Paso 
Cnty., 555 S.W.3d 812 (Tex. App. 2018). This immunity extends to court staff, 
including coordinators, when their actions are integral to the judicial process. Sledd 
v. Garrett, 123 S.W.3d 592 (Tex. App. 2003). 
D. Requirements for Federal Relief 
 
13. To succeed in federal court, the Respondent must show: 
 
i. The coordinator’s actions are not protected by absolute or quasi-
 
judicial immunity (i.e., they are administrative, not judicial, and 
 
not integral to the judicial process). 
 
ii. The actions are ultra vires—wholly unauthorized by law. 
 
iii. The actions have caused or threaten to cause deprivation of a 
 
federally protected right (e.g., due process under the Fourteenth 
 
Amendment). 
IV. Why Federal Action Is Warranted 
 
14. The appropriateness and urgency of federal intervention are heightened 
by the following circumstances:

E. Removal from Home and Children Without a Hearing 
 
15. The respondent’s removal from his home and children’s lives without a 
hearing on January 16, 2024, is a direct violation of fundamental due process 
rights. The Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause provides heightened 
protection against government interference with a parent’s fundamental liberty 
interest in the care, custody, and control of their children (Brice v. The Tex. Dep't of 
Family & Protective Servs., 14-20-00506-CV (Tex. App. May 03, 2022)). Due 
process requires notice and an opportunity to be heard before such drastic 
measures are taken (Schmitt v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, 121222 MSPB, SF-0714-
18-0121-I-1). The absence of a hearing before removal is a paradigmatic due 
process violation, and when state courts fail to remedy such a violation, federal 
intervention is not only appropriate but necessary to protect constitutional rights. 
F. Rendition of Unsigned, Defective Orders and Judicial Inaction 
 
16. After being removed from his home on January 16, 2024, the case was 
kicked to a different judge, who compounded the issues when he compelled the 
Respondent to agree to the situation despite his consent not being present, and 
despite having unopposed facts that clearly highlight that the Petitioner, Morgan 
Michelle Myers, fabricated her initial pleadings – including her divorce 
application, protective order application, and affidavit of indigency.

17. After being unlawfully removed from his home, the associate judge 
rendered into effect orders that do not bear the respondent’s signature, coupled 
with the court’s refusal to vacate facially defective orders or issue findings, further 
compounding the due process violations. The Texas Supreme Court has made clear 
that procedural rules cannot abridge, enlarge, or modify the substantive rights of a 
litigant (Tex. Gov't. Code § 22.004). The failure to provide a meaningful 
opportunity to challenge defective orders, and the court’s refusal to address these 
defects, deprives the respondent of both procedural and substantive rights, 
justifying federal injunctive relief. 
G.  Allegations of Racketeering and Broader Judicial Misconduct 
 
18. Because this Court has not provided the Respondent with a forum to 
adjudicate the important issues, the Respondent has opened concurrent litigation in 
the Western District of Oklahoma under the RICO act to pursue damages caused by 
this situation. 
 
19. The assertion that the divorce suit is part of a pattern of racketeering 
activity being pursued in federal court in Oklahoma, while not directly adjudicated 
here, underscores the seriousness and potential systemic nature of the misconduct. 
Because the state court process is being used as an instrument of ongoing 
racketeering or fraud, and state remedies have proven ineffective, federal courts

have a heightened responsibility to intervene to prevent further abuse of process 
and protect federal rights. 
H. Ongoing Judicial Errors and Harm to Children 
 
20. The continued errors by multiple judges, including the regional presiding 
judge, and the direct harm caused to a child, further support the need for federal 
intervention. The legitimacy of the judicial process is based on public confidence 
that the system settles controversies impartially and fairly (Sun Exploration and 
Production Co. v. Jackson, 783 S.W.2d 202 (Tex. 1989)). When judicial errors 
result in actual harm to children and the affected party is denied any meaningful 
remedy, the case for federal relief is compelling. 
I. Sua Sponte Setting of Final Trial Amidst Unresolved Issues 
 
21. Finally, despite numerous issues, objections, and despite virtually no 
participation from the opposing side, the Court continues to show a one-sided 
favoritism towards them.  
 
22. The court’s decision to set the case for final trial sua sponte, despite 
unresolved due process and procedural violations, further demonstrates a disregard 
for the respondent’s rights and the integrity of the judicial process. This action, in

merely erroneous but fundamentally unfair and constitutionally suspect (Ex parte 
Lewis (Tex. Crim. App. May 8, 2024)). 
V. Conclusion 
 
23. Federal court intervention is not only appropriate but urgently warranted 
in this case, given the repeated, unauthorized actions of the court coordinator, the 
respondent’s removal from his home and children without a hearing, the 
enforcement of unsigned and defective orders, the court’s refusal to address these 
defects, and the ongoing pattern of judicial errors and harm. The ultra vires 
exception to sovereign immunity, as recognized in both Texas and federal law, 
allows for prospective injunctive relief against state officials whose actions are 
wholly unauthorized and result in a real or imminent deprivation of federally 
protected rights. The cumulative effect of these procedural and constitutional 
violations, especially after exhaustion of state remedies, compels federal 
intervention to restore the rule of law and protect the respondent’s due process and 
family integrity rights.
