Before the Court is Defendant Charles Myers’s Notice of Removal (ECF No. 1), filed 
December 4, 2024. Defendant removed this case to federal court, citing “deprivation of 
constitutionally protected rights under the 14th Amendment.” ECF No. 1-1. The removal statute 
allows a defendant to “remove a state court action to federal court only if the action could have 
originally been filed in federal court.” 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a); Anderson v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 2 F.3d 
590, 593 (5th Cir. 1993).  
In his Notice of Removal, Defendant appears to argue that the divorce and child custody 
orders entered against him in state court are unconstitutional. ECF No. 1. Essentially, Defendant 
asks this Court to review a state court decision. ECF No. 1 at 5. But federal district courts do not 
have authority to review state court decisions. “A basic precept of our federal system is that federal 
courts do not exercise authority over the proceedings of a sovereign state’s judiciary as it relates 
to that state’s laws.” Turner v. GoAuto Ins. Co., 33 F.4th 214, 216 (5th Cir. 2022).
