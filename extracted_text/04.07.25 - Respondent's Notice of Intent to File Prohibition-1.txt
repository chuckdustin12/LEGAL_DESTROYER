months of inaction, is seeking to set an improperly filed consolidation motion used as a tactic to 
stall emergency relief. 
Notably, the participation from Petitioner resurfaces again only in the face of an 
emergency TRO. It doesn’t come with good faith or arguments; it only comes with a false sense 
of urgency by the opposing counsel in this matter. This court has sat on its’ hands for months, 
and then despite the failure to prosecute from the other side, it chooses to act on the wrong 
motion. Such a display is legally improper, unjustified, and showcases the complete disregard for 
what would otherwise be a prima facie case warranting dismissal for want of prosecution.  
Now, rather than acting sua sponte to set the DWOP for hearing, the court instead 
chooses to entertain a prematurely filed consolidation motion which it has no jurisdiction to rule 
on. As the Texas Supreme Court has held previously: “[a] plaintiff has a duty to “prosecut[e] the 
suit to a conclusion with reasonable diligence,” failing which a trial court may dismiss for want 
of prosecution.” In re Conner, 458 S.W.3d 532 (Tex. 2015) (citing Callahan v. Staples, 139 Tex. 
8, 161 S.W.2d 489, 491 (1942)). The court has wide discretion to manage its’ docket, so it begs 
the question as to why the court wants to act on its own accord on a motion to consolidate before 
the case is properly transferred. 
Although the writ of prohibition is intended to prevent this Court from setting a matter 
for hearing that is procedurally improper, the issue in this case mirrors that addressed by the 
Texas Supreme Court in In re Conner, 458 S.W.3d 532 (Tex. 2015). There, the Court considered 
whether a trial court abuses its discretion by refusing to grant a motion to dismiss for want of 
prosecution in the face of unmitigated and unexplained delay—and held that it does. That is 
precisely the circumstance presented here, and this intended writ of prohibition is to prevent this 
court from causing even further delays by setting a matter for a hearing which it has no

jurisdiction to rule on, and give the court the ability to dismiss this case for want of prosecution 
given that it has the discretion to do so, and no opposition to it from the opposing party. 
II. LEGAL FRAMEWORK 
A. Writ of Prohibition 
A writ of prohibition is an extraordinary legal remedy that serves specific, limited 
purposes in the Texas legal system. It is a judicial order issued by a higher court to prevent a 
lower court from exceeding its jurisdiction or interfering with the higher court's determination of 
a case. 
Key characteristics of a writ of prohibition include: 
1. Limited Purpose Remedy: A writ of prohibition is used to protect the subject matter of 
an appeal or to prohibit unlawful interference with enforcement of a superior court's 
judgment (Sivley v. Sivley, 972 S.W.2d 850, 863, Tex. App.—Tyler 1998). 
2. Preventive Nature: The writ is designed to prevent future actions, not to remedy acts 
already completed. It can only be used to prevent what is about to be or could be done, 
not as a remedy for acts that are already completed (United States v. Hoffman, 71 U.S. 
158, 1866). Here, Respondent seeks to use this writ as a means to prevent the court from 
causing further delays by setting opposing counsel’s improper motion to consolidate. 
3. Extraordinary Remedy: Courts have characterized a writ of prohibition as a "drastic 
remedy" and the legal equivalent of an equitable injunction (In re Lewis, 223 S.W.3d 756, 
761, Tex. App.—Texarkana 2007). This is a drastic circumstance. The Respondent has

jurisdiction to rule on, and give the court the ability to dismiss this case for want of prosecution

given that it has the discretion to do so, and no opposition to it from the opposing party.

Ul. LEGAL FRAMEWORK

A. Writ of Prohibition

A writ of prohibition is an extraordinary legal remedy that serves specific, limited
purposes in the Texas legal system. It is a judicial order issued by a higher court to prevent a
lower court from exceeding its jurisdiction or interfering with the higher court's determination of

a Case.

Key characteristics of a writ of prohibition include:

1. Limited Purpose Remedy: A writ of prohibition is used to protect the subject matter of
an appeal or to prohibit unlawful interference with enforcement of a superior court's

judgment (Sivley v. Sivley, 972 S.W.2d 850, 863, Tex. App.—Tyler 1998).

2. Preventive Nature: The writ is designed to prevent future actions, not to remedy acts

causing further delays by setting opposing counsel’s improper motion to consolidate.

3. Extraordinary Remedy: Courts have characterized a writ of prohibition as a "drastic
remedy" and the legal equivalent of an equitable injunction (/n re Lewis, 223 S.W.3d 756,

761, Tex. App.—Texarkana 2007). This is a drastic circumstance. The Respondent has

M.2008 M.2008

been barred from his own residence for over a year without any explanation, and without 
any case prosecution in a one-sided effort to obtain relief from facially void orders. 
4. Last Resort: Prohibition is not appropriate if any other remedy, such as appeal, is 
available and adequate (In re Castle Tex. Prod. Ltd. P'ship, 189 S.W.3d 400, 404, Tex. 
App.—Tyler 2006). Here, Respondent has no adequate remedy by appeal, because there 
is currently no court with continuous, exclusive jurisdiction over the children in this 
matter. 
III. STATEMENT OF FACTS 
5. On January 24, 2025, after more than 11 months of inaction, Petitioner filed a Motion 
to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution in this court. The divorce case has had no substantive action 
from Petitioner since April 2024, a legal ghost ship drifting without direction or purpose. That 
motion wasn’t attempted to be set for hearing until September of 2024, only after the 
Respondent exhausted all efforts seeking relief throughout the Texas Judiciary without any 
participation from the opposing side. 
6. On March 19, 2025, driven by mounting concerns about the children’s welfare and 
learning that the 322nd District Court did not have continuous, exclusive jurisdiction over the 
children in this matter, Petitioner filed a new SAPCR in the 233rd District Court (Cause No. 233-
765358-25) seeking emergency relief for the children. The very next day, March 20, 2025, Ms. 
Carter suddenly reappeared like a character presumed missing in the second act, filing an answer 
to the SAPCR petition in this Court and thereby submitting to this Court’s jurisdiction by filing a 
response rather than a motion to abate.

765358-25) seeking emergency relief for the children. The very next day, March 20, 2025, Ms.

7. On March 21, 2025, Respondent filed a verified Rule 12 motion challenging Ms. 
Carter’s authority in the 233rd to represent Petitioner in the matter—the second such challenge, 
met with the same resounding silence as the first. 
8. On March 25, 2025, Respondent filed an Objection to Consolidation and an Ex-Parte 
Emergency Motion for TRO in the 233rd. Two days later, on March 27, 2025, Respondent 
contacted the court coordinator, requested a date and time to present the motion, and served the 
documents to the opposing party with the intent to present on March 28, 2025, at 9:00 A.M. 
before the Associate Judge of this Court. On that fateful morning of March 28, 2025, Respondent 
drove to the courthouse, paid for parking, met with the coordinator, communicated with 
opposing counsel, and secured a hearing date of April 10, 2025 agreed by the parties. 
Respondent then proceeded to the Associate Judge’s courtroom to present the TRO. 
9. Before Respondent could present his case—before he could speak a single word about 
his children’s welfare—he was told that Ms. Carter would be filing a motion to consolidate in the 
322nd District Court, that his motion was improperly before the 233rd court, and the Associate 
Judge refused to hear the motion. It was a curious thing, this refusal. Ms. Carter wasn’t even 
present in the courtroom, yet her words carried more weight than Respondent’s physical 
presence, his properly filed papers, and most importantly, the urgent needs of his children. She 
stopped the proceedings with nothing more than word of mouth for the incorrect motion. A true 
showcasing of disregard for the process, and the children. 
10. On April 2, 2025, Respondent filed a Pre-Objection to Motion to Consolidate in the 
322nd District Court. Ms. Carter’s motion to consolidate wasn’t filed with the 322nd District 
Court until April 3, 2025, six days after she used its mere possibility to prevent the 233rd Court

322™ District Court. Ms. Carter’s motion to consolidate wasn’t filed with the 322" District

Court until April 3, 2025, six days after she used its mere possibility to prevent the 233rd Court

from hearing Respondent’s emergency motion. Her motion disregarded Respondent’s pre-
objection entirely, as if it were invisible ink on the page. 
11. On April 4, 2025, unable to acquire a ruling due to Respondent’s objection, Ms. 
Carter attempted to set the motion for a hearing before the 322nd District Court. That same day, 
Respondent filed a Pre-Objection to Motion to Transfer in the 233rd Court, given that a motion 
to transfer must come before any attempt at consolidation. Ms. Carter, who had been so urgently 
concerned about consolidation when it served to block Respondent’s emergency hearing, 
suddenly claimed to be unavailable until late April—causing significant delays that could have 
been avoided had the 233rd Court simply heard the motion before it on March 28, 2025. 
12. Throughout this period of procedural maneuvering, the children have been subjected 
to psychological manipulation and medical neglect. They have been removed from Petitioner’s 
care and placed with elderly great-grandparents on a daily basis, and are being gaslighted into a 
false belief that the divorce is finalized. Respondent’s eldest child’s academic performance has 
plummeted, and both children have become emotionally estranged from both parents. 
Respondent has suffered approximately $110,500 in verifiable financial damages due to being 
locked out of his home and business, and it grows each day. But the financial toll pales in 
comparison to the emotional cost of watching Respondent’s children suffer while the courts 
exchange procedurally incorrect volleys over his head.  
IV. THE PROHIBITION PREDICAMENT 
13. The writ of prohibition exists for precisely this sort of situation—where a court is 
about to act in a way that exceeds its authority and threatens to compound an already untenable 
situation. The law on this matter is as clear as a bell on a still morning:

A. The Procedural Parade Must Follow Its Proper Order 
14. The Texas Family Code establishes a clear sequence for the consolidation of cases 
from different courts. First, a motion to transfer must be filed and granted, bringing both cases 
into the same court. Only then may a motion to consolidate be considered. See Tex. Fam. Code 
§§ 155.201 and 6.407. 
15. This isn't merely a matter of dotting i's and crossing t's—it's the fundamental roadmap 
that ensures cases proceed in an orderly fashion. A court cannot consolidate what it does not 
possess, any more than a chef can cook ingredients that haven't yet been delivered to the kitchen. 
16. The Texas Supreme Court has consistently held that courts must follow proper 
procedural sequence. In re Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., 35 S.W.3d 602, 605 (Tex. 2000). When a 
court attempts to rule on a matter for which it lacks jurisdiction or authority, prohibition is the 
appropriate remedy. In re Lewis, 223 S.W.3d 756, 761 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2007, orig. 
proceeding). 
17. Respondent is no legal scholar with a library of case law memorized, but even he can 
see that this principle is as plain as a full moon on a cloudless night. This Court's potential 
willingness to hear a motion to consolidate before a motion to transfer has been filed and granted 
would be like a judge sentencing a defendant before the trial has begun—a clear inversion of the 
proper order of legal proceedings. 
B. The Discretion Dilemma 
18. The writ of prohibition as used in Texas has three functions:  1) preventing 
interference with higher courts in deciding a pending appeal, 2) preventing inferior courts from 
entertaining suits that will relitigate controversies which have already been settled by issuing

courts, and 3) prohibiting a trial court's action when it affirmatively appears that the court lacks 
jurisdiction. Texas Capital Bank-Westwood v. Johnson, 864 S.W.2d 186, 187 (Tex.App.-
Texarkana 1993, orig. proceeding). Here, function three is directly relevant. A court cannot hear a 
motion to consolidate a case it does not have before it.  
C. Opposing Counsel's Conduct 
19. Ms. Carter's behavior throughout this saga deserves special attention, like a character 
in a novel whose actions consistently contradict their stated intentions. 
20. She abandoned the divorce case for nearly a year, filing nothing since April 2024, 
only to suddenly reappear when Respondent sought emergency relief for the children—like a 
firefighter who ignores a smoldering house for months, only to rush in when someone else calls 
for help. 
21. She filed an answer in the 233rd Court, thereby submitting to its jurisdiction, only to 
then argue that the case belongs in this Court—a contradiction as glaring as claiming to be both 
inside and outside a room simultaneously. 
22. She used the mere possibility of a future filing to block an emergency hearing, then 
waited six days to file the motion—a delay that speaks volumes about the true urgency of the

23. She filed a motion to consolidate without first filing a motion to transfer, putting the 
procedural cart before the horse in a manner that defies both logic and law.

courts, and 3) prohibiting a trial court's action when it affirmatively appears that the court lacks

jurisdiction. Texas Capital Bank-Westwood v. Johnson, 864 S.W.2d 186, 187 (Tex.App.-

Texarkana 1993, orig. proceeding). Here, function three is directly relevant. A court cannot hear a

motion to consolidate a case it does not have before it.

C. Opposing Counsel's Conduct

19. Ms. Carter's behavior throughout this saga deserves special attention, like a character

in a novel whose actions consistently contradict their stated intentions.

20. She abandoned the divorce case for nearly a year, filing nothing since April 2024,
only to suddenly reappear when Respondent sought emergency relief for the children—like a
firefighter who ignores a smoldering house for months, only to rush in when someone else calls

for help.

21. She filed an answer in the 233rd Court, thereby submitting to its jurisdiction, only to
then argue that the case belongs in this Court—a contradiction as glaring as claiming to be both

inside and outside a room simultaneously.

22. She used the mere possibility of a future filing to block an emergency hearing, then
waited six days to file the motion—a delay that speaks volumes about the true urgency of the

matter.

23. She filed a motion to consolidate without first filing a motion to transfer, putting the

procedural cart before the horse in a manner that defies both logic and law.

24. She now claims to be unavailable until late April, creating further delay after using 
the urgency of consolidation to block Respondent’s emergency hearing—a scheduling 
contradiction that would be comical if not for the children caught in its web. 
25. This pattern reveals a tactical attempt to manipulate both courts' dockets to prevent 
me from obtaining timely relief. It's a shell game played with Respondent’s children's welfare as 
the prize. This Court should not allow itself to be used as an instrument in such procedural 
gamesmanship, particularly when children's lives hang in the balance. 
V. MORAL FIBER 
26. If there's a lesson to be drawn from this procedural quagmire, it's that the law's 
complexity should never obscure its fundamental purpose: to provide justice, particularly for 
those most vulnerable. My children—innocent bystanders in this adult conflict—have become 
collateral damage in a game of procedural chess where the rules seem to change with each move. 
27. It has been stated that the true measure of a society is found in how it treats its most 
vulnerable members. By that measure, the procedural labyrinth that has prevented the 233rd 
Court from hearing Respondent’s emergency motion, and now threatens to compound the error 
by having this Court act prematurely, speaks volumes about how far we have strayed from the 
ideal of justice. 
28. Respondent provide this notice not out of anger or vindictiveness, but out of that 
quiet, bewildered astonishment that settles in a person's bones when they've witnessed the law 
being twisted into shapes that would make a carnival contortionist blush with envy. Respondent 
followed the rules. He honored the procedures. He placed his faith in a system that promised 
justice would flow like water, clear and unobstructed, to those who seek it properly.

29. Behind every case number, behind every filing, behind every procedural rule, there 
are real children with real lives that continue whether the courts act or not. Time doesn't stop for 
them while adults sort out procedural disagreements. They grow, they hurt, they form memories 
and impressions that will shape them for a lifetime. 
30. As Mark Twain might have observed, the difference between proper procedure and 
improper procedure is not merely academic—it's the difference between justice served and 
justice denied, between children protected and children neglected, between a system that works 
and one that merely pretends to. 
VI. CONCLUSION AND PRAYER 
31. I respectfully request that this Court pause, reflect on the procedural peculiarity 
before it, and decline to hear a motion to consolidate until the proper preliminary steps have been 
taken. Specifically, I ask that this Court: 
a. Recognize that it lacks jurisdiction to hear a motion to consolidate until a motion to 
transfer has been filed in the 233rd Court and granted; 
b. Take judicial notice that Petitioner submitted to the 233rd Court's jurisdiction by 
answering the SAPCR petition; 
c. Acknowledge the improper procedural sequence attempted by Petitioner's counsel in 
filing a motion to consolidate without first filing a motion to transfer; 
d. Consider that proceeding with a hearing on the consolidation motion would only 
compound the procedural irregularities and further delay relief for the children;

e. Recognize that the 233rd Court has the power and jurisdiction to address the 
emergency concerns raised in my TRO motion, which remains unopposed on the record. 
f. Using the court’s own inherent power, dismiss the divorce outright for failure to 
prosecute given the circumstances of this case. 
Respondent understands that in most situations, courts give deference to licensed attorneys over 
self-represented litigants. But the procedural impropriety here is so glaring, so fundamental, that 
it transcends the usual presumptions. Even a layperson can see that you cannot consolidate what 
you do not possess, just as you cannot serve a meal with ingredients you haven't yet purchased. 
The children deserve better than to have their fate determined by procedural sleight of hand. 
They deserve courts that follow the law's clear sequence, that prioritize substance over form, and 
that remember that behind every procedural rule are real lives hanging in the balance. The truth 
of this matter can only be revealed once the injustices are duly corrected by this court. 
 
Respondent has filed a similar notice to the 233rd court informing of the intent to file a 
writ of mandamus to compel a ruling on the emergency TRO that was unlawfully blocked from 
being heard by COOPER L. CARTER.

15. The court, at this point, is choosing to not grant relief despite having no reason 
to do so. 
16. This litigation has no possible means to an end, and it should be dismissed 
outright so that the SAPCR may continue. 
17. There has been no filed opposition, objection, or arguments made against the 
Respondent’s position in either suit. 
18. The Petitioner has wasted everyone’s time, caused significant damage, and 
remains hidden in fear of being held accountable. 
19. The Petitioner prioritized an extramarital affair over prosecuting the divorce, 
and the children and Respondent have been significantly harmed. 
Therefore, this case should be dismissed as a matter of law. Every day causes more 
irreparable harm, and this court has every ability and reason to rectify this situation immediately. 
Respondent already has the solution and has been the only party in this matter seeking relief. It is 
simply unacceptable to permit this to continue.

Statement of the Case 
Nature of Underlying Proceeding: This original proceeding arises from a Suit 
Affecting the Parent-Child Relationship ("SAPCR") involving two minor children, 
M.E.M. and C.R.M., in which Relator filed an emergency ex parte application for 
temporary restraining order ("TRO") in the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County, 
Texas. The underlying SAPCR (Cause No. 233-765358-25) was a new proceeding 
initiated by Relator on March 19, 2025, and was answered on March 20, 2025. 
There is a related divorce matter (322-744263-23) that has not been prosecuted 
since April 24, 2024, and no final orders have been rendered. Relator seeks 
declaratory and injunctive relief preventing the Real Party in Interest from barring 
Relator’s from accessing his home, business, and children until valid orders are 
rendered that reflect the children’s best interests. 
Respondent Judge: The Respondent Judge, Kate Stone, is the presiding Associate 
Judge of the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County, Texas. Her office is located at 
200 E. Weatherford St. 5th Floor Fort Worth, TX 76196-0227. 
Respondent’s Challenged Actions and inaction: The trial court refused to hear 
an emergency motion before it on March 28, 2025, and used out-of-court 
statements made by the opposing counsel regarding a forward looking 
consolidation motion that would be filed at a later date, and denied to hear the 
motion after a full hearing date was agreed upon by both parties for April 10, 2025.

Issues Presented 
 
B. Are the March 14, 2024, temporary orders rendered by an Associate 
Judge void ab initio because they explicitly state that all parties agree to 
the terms of the order yet only contain the signatures of the opposing 
party and were never properly adopted by the referring court? 
 
C. Did the Respondent abuse her discretion by failing to perform a clear 
ministerial duty when she refused to consider and rule on Relator's 
properly filed ex parte emergency Application for TRO? 
 
D. Did the Respondent further abuse her discretion un-setting the matter for 
a hearing, and favoring a forward-looking consolidation motion as the 
grounds for denying to hear the emergency TRO before a transfer was 
filed? 
 
E. The Relator has been left without an adequate remedy for an appeal 
because no order resulted from the Respondent judge’s refusal to act on 
Relator’s emergency TRO. 
 
F. Did the Respondent clearly abuse her discretion by excluding any 
exhibits related to the emergency TRO?

ARGUMENT 
A. Mandamus Standard 
Mandamus relief is not merely appropriate but imperative in this case 
because the trial court's inaction and the continued enforcement of a void order 
constitute a clear abuse of discretion for which Relator has no adequate remedy at 
law. The Texas Supreme Court has consistently and unequivocally held that to 
obtain mandamus relief, a Relator must show (1) the trial court clearly abused its 
discretion or violated a duty imposed by law, and (2) there is no adequate remedy 
by appeal. In re Bass, 113 S.W.3d 735, 738 (Tex. 2003) (orig. proceeding); Walker 
v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 839 (Tex. 1992). 
Texas jurisprudence firmly establishes that mandamus will lie to correct a 
void order, even without a traditional showing of inadequate appellate remedy. As 
the Supreme Court of Texas definitively stated in Urbish v. 127th Judicial Dist. 
Court, 708 S.W.2d 429, 431 (Tex. 1986) (orig. proceeding), mandamus will issue 
to correct a void order, i.e., an order the trial court had no power or jurisdiction to 
render. The Court has further emphasized in In re Sw. Bell Tel. Co., 35 S.W.3d 602, 
605 (Tex. 2000) (orig. proceeding) that if an order is void, the Relator need not 
show he lacks an adequate appellate remedy, and mandamus relief is appropriate. 
This principle was recently reaffirmed in In re J.R., No. 02-21-00060-CV, 2021 
WL 1421440 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth Apr. 15, 2021, orig. proceeding), where the

court explicitly stated: "A trial court abuses its discretion if it enters a void order, 
and mandamus will issue to remedy the void order regardless of whether the relator 
has an adequate remedy by appeal." 
B. The temporary orders rendered on March 14, 2024, are void ab initio 
A fundamental and inviolable principle in Texas jurisprudence is that a 
judgment based on a settlement requires the consent of both parties at the time it is 
rendered by the court. The Texas Supreme Court's seminal decision in Burnaman v. 
Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 (1951) established the bedrock principle that a party 
is free to withdraw their consent to a settlement at any time before the judgment is 
rendered. The Court's language was unambiguous and leaves no room for 
interpretation: "A valid consent judgment cannot be rendered by a court when 
consent of one of the parties thereto is wanting. It is not sufficient that a party's 
consent may at one time have been given; consent must exist at the very moment 
the court undertakes to make the agreement the judgment of the court." Id. This 
principle has been consistently reaffirmed, as in Carter v. Carter, 535 S.W.2d 215 
(Tex. Civ. App. 1976), which emphasized that "the law seems to be clear that a 
consent judgment cannot be rendered by a trial court when consent of one of the 
parties is lacking, even though that consent may have been previously given." 
In the present case, the only orders rendered by any court were rendered as 
consent judgments but lack the signatures of all parties. The orders themselves

explicitly state "As evidenced by the signatures below, all parties agree to the terms 
of this order" on page 1, APP 2.1, and later page 38 states "APPROVED AND 
CONSENTED TO AS TO BOTH FORM AND SUBSTANCE" yet crucially lacks 
the signature of the Relator and his prior counsel. APP 2.38. The Court must 
recognize that the absence of the Relator’s signature is not a mere technical 
deficiency but a fatal jurisdictional flaw that renders the orders void ab initio. 
Because his signature was required to effectuate consent, and the orders themselves 
acknowledge this requirement, the orders are unquestionably void. 
C. Outright refusing to hear the emergency TRO is a clear abuse of discretion  
It is well-settled and beyond legitimate dispute that a trial court has a 
ministerial duty to consider and rule on motions that have been properly filed and 
brought to the court's attention. The Texas Court of Appeals has emphatically 
stated, "When a motion is properly filed and pending before the trial court, the act 
of giving consideration to and ruling upon that motion is a ministerial act, and 
mandamus may issue to compel the trial judge to act." Safety-Kleen Corp. v. 
Garcia, 945 S.W.2d 268, 269 (Tex. App.- San Antonio 1997, orig. proceeding). To 
establish an abuse of discretion for refusal to rule, the relator must show: (1) the 
trial court had a legal duty to perform a nondiscretionary act, (2) the relator 
requested performance of that act, and (3) the trial court failed or refused to do so.

In re Shredder Co., L.L.C., 225 S.W.3d 676, 679 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2006, orig. 
proceeding). 
Here, the Relator properly filed his emergency TRO application in the 233rd 
District Court, meticulously followed all procedural requirements, and appeared at 
the scheduled time to present at 9:00 A.M. on March 28, 2025. SUPP 2.11 The 
Court must recognize that the court's refusal to even consider the application—
based solely on an opposing counsel's unverified, informal representation about a 
future filing in another court—constitutes a clear and inexcusable failure to 
perform a ministerial duty – especially when no response or opposition to the TRO 
was filed by the opposing party and that same party was permitted to interfere with 
the proceedings without being present in the courtroom. SUPP 2.19 
The refusal is particularly troubling because 1) The TRO application 
involved un-opposed allegations of immediate harm to children, which courts are 
obligated to address promptly; 2) the refusal was due to a forward looking 
consolidation motion; 3) even if a motion to consolidate had been filed, it would 
not automatically divest the 233rd Court of jurisdiction until actually granted; and 
4) the proper procedure would have been a motion to transfer, not consolidation. 
See Tex. Fam. Code § 6.407. This misapplication of the law resulted in the refusal 
to hear a properly filed motion to favor a procedurally improper motion that hadn’t 
even been filed yet.

In In re Blakeney, 254 S.W.3d 659, 661 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2008, orig. 
proc.), the court held that mandamus is appropriate when a trial court refuses to 
rule on a properly filed motion and the relator has no adequate remedy by appeal. 
That is precisely the situation here. The 233rd Court's refusal to even consider 
Relator's emergency TRO application has left him with no forum to address his 
urgent concerns about the children's welfare, as the case before the 322nd has been 
procedurally abandoned and Relator has been seeking relief from facially void 
temporary orders to no avail since March 14, 2024, without any opposition from 
the opposing counsel. SUPP 3.2 
D. Improper consolidation does not justify the refusal to act 
The 233rd Court’s refusal to act was based on a fundamentally flawed legal 
premise: that the 322nd District Court had continuing exclusive jurisdiction over 
the children. Under Texas Family Code § 155.001, a court acquires continuing 
exclusive jurisdiction over children only when it renders a “final order” in a 
SAPCR. It is undisputed that the 322nd Court never rendered any final order 
regarding the children. Without a final order, the 322nd Court never acquired 
continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the children. Therefore, the 233rd Court 
was entirely within its authority to hear and rule on Relator’s emergency TRO 
application pursuant to § 155.001.

Moreover, even if the 322nd Court had continuing exclusive jurisdiction 
(which it does not), the proper procedure would have been a motion to transfer 
under the Family Code, not consolidation. Consolidation is appropriate for related 
cases within the same court, not for transferring jurisdiction between courts. By 
refusing to act based on an anticipated consolidation motion, the 233rd Court 
fundamentally misapplied the law, as consolidation cannot be effectuated prior to 
the transfer of the action. Tex. Fam. Code § 6.407. 
Rather, opposing counsel could have filed a plea in abatement but instead 
chose to Respond to the SAPCR after not prosecuting the divorce case since April 
24, 2024. 
E. Relator has been left with no adequate remedy by an appeal 
 
Because the 233rd District Court outright refused to hear the emergency 
TRO before it and the appearance before the court produced no order, the Relator 
has been left without an adequate remedy for an appeal. The Texas Supreme Court 
has recognized that mandamus relief is appropriate when "a party's ability to 
present a viable claim or defense is vitiated or severely compromised." In re 
Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 136 (Tex. 2004). That is precisely the 
situation here. The Relator has diligently sought relief in a one-sided case to no 
avail, and the 233rd SAPCR was opened to escape the abandoned divorce suit that 
hasn't been prosecuted since April 24th, 2024, and has no valid orders in effect.

Moreover, even if the 322nd Court had continuing exclusive jurisdiction
(which it does not), the proper procedure would have been a motion to transfer
under the Family Code, not consolidation. Consolidation is appropriate for related
cases within the same court, not for transferring jurisdiction between courts. By
refusing to act based on an anticipated consolidation motion, the 233rd Court
fundamentally misapplied the law, as consolidation cannot be effectuated prior to
the transfer of the action. Tex. Fam. Code § 6.407.

Rather, opposing counsel could have filed a plea in abatement but instead
chose to Respond to the SAPCR after not prosecuting the divorce case since April
24, 2024.

E. Relator has been left with no adequate remedy by an appeal

Because the 233rd District Court outright refused to hear the emergency
TRO before it and the appearance before the court produced no order, the Relator
has been left without an adequate remedy for an appeal. The Texas Supreme Court
has recognized that mandamus relief is appropriate when "a party's ability to
present a viable claim or defense is vitiated or severely compromised." Jn re
Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 136 (Tex. 2004). That is precisely the
situation here. The Relator has diligently sought relief in a one-sided case to no
avail, and the 233rd SAPCR was opened to escape the abandoned divorce suit that

hasn't been prosecuted since April 24th, 2024, and has no valid orders in effect.

F. Refusal to accept relevant exhibits central to the emergency TRO 
 
On April 9th, 2025, Relator attempted to file a NOTICE OF INCLUSION 
with the trial court, which included critical exhibits related to the emergency TRO. 
The Judge refused outright to permit Relator to include any exhibits related to the 
TRO in the rejection comments. SUPP 2.13, 2.16 When contacting the clerk's 
office, no substantive response was received from the court coordinator. The 
returned comment stated: "Judge’s request. Please resubmit without the attached 
exhibits" without citing any legal authority, statute, rule, or local procedure 
justifying this rejection. SUPP 1.1. 
This rejection by the clerk constitutes a clear violation of the Texas Rules of 
Civil Procedure. Rule 21(f)(11) states: "The clerk may not refuse to file a 
document that fails to conform with this rule." Instead, the rule provides that the 
clerk "may identify the error to be corrected and state a deadline for the party to 
resubmit the document in a conforming format." Here, the clerk provided no 
specific error to be corrected, and no legal basis for the rejection outside of “we are 
unable to accept any exhibits into the case”. SUPP 1.1 By doing so, the Relator has 
been deprived of essential privileges to make a record pursuant to Tex. Const Art. 
1, § 19. 
Moreover, Rule 59 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure states: “Notes, 
accounts, bonds, mortgages, records, and all other written instruments,

constituting, in whole or in part, the claim sued on, or the matter set up in defense, 
may be made a part of the pleadings by copies thereof, or the originals, being 
attached or filed and referred to as such, or by copying the same in the body of the 
pleading in aid and explanation of the allegations in the petition or answer made in 
reference to said instruments and shall be deemed a part thereof for all purposes.” 
The request to remove the exhibits specifically for the emergency TRO without 
any statutory backing raises suspicion that the trial court is actively trying to 
prevent the record from being properly established. 
Finally, by rejecting exhibits central to Relator's emergency TRO application 
without legal justification, the clerk has effectively denied Relator the ability to 
make a complete record and present all relevant evidence to this court, thereby 
impairing Relator's due process rights. The rejected exhibits have been served on 
the opposing party and will be included in the supplemental record pursuant to Tex. 
R. App. P. § 52.7(b). 
 
CONCLUSION AND PRAYER 
 
Relator has been seeking relief for his children for over a year while the  
opposing party has failed to prosecute their case. They obtained orders by falsely 
claiming consent and then abandoned their case. There have been no filed 
responses to any relief sought by the Relator, no objections filed, and if the Relator

that the real party in interest ever intended to move the dormant divorce proceeding 
towards final trial. There are no valid, legally binding orders in effect, yet they 
have been used to control the Relator’s livelihood and have destroyed the 
children’s status quo. The opposing counsel only resurfaced at the 11th hour in a 
separate proceeding for the sole purpose of interfering with the relief sought by the 
Relator without even being present in the courtroom. SUPP 2.19 
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Relator Charles Dustin Myers 
respectfully prays that this Court: 
1. Issue a writ of mandamus directing Respondent, the Honorable Kate Stone, 
Associate Judge of the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County, Texas, to hear 
and rule on Relator's Emergency Application for Temporary Restraining 
Order at the earliest practical date; 
2. Grant the emergency temporary relief requested in Relator's separate 
Emergency Motion under TRAP 52.10, filed concurrently with this petition 
because the orders are facially void; 
3. Take judicial notice that Relator has been unlawfully barred from his 
matrimonial residence and children under these void orders for over a year

3. Standing
The law allows me to file this case because | am: (Check one.)
[] the mother of the child(ren).

[Ml the “legal father’ of the child(ren). An Acknowledgment of Paternity form has been signed and filed
with the Vital Statistics Unit for each child. A copy of each Acknowledgment of Paternity is attached to
this Petition.

[] a person who has had actual care, control, and possession of the child(ren) for at least 6 months
ending not more than 90 days before the date this Petition is filed with the Court. | am not a foster
parent.

CL] a person who lived with the child(ren) and the child(ren)’s parent, guardian, or managing conservator
for at least 6 months ending not more than 90 days before the date this Petition is filed with the Court,
and the child(ren)’s parent, guardian, or managing conservator is now dead.

[] the grandparent, great-grandparent, sister, brother, aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew of the child(ren)
and: (Check the box below that applies to your case.)

[] both parents are dead.
[1] both parents, the surviving parent, or managing conservator agree to me filing this case.

[] the child(ren)’s present circumstances will significantly impair (harm) the child(ren)’s physical
health or emotional development.

[] other:
(Read the law about standing in Texas Family Code Sections 102.003, 102.004 and 102.006)

Note: If you are the mother or biological father of the child/ren and an Acknowledgment of Paternity form has
not been signed and filed for each child, you may need to file a paternity case instead of a Suit Affecting the

Parent-Child Relationship (SAPCR) case. Get information about filing a paternity case at
www. TexasLawHelp.org.

4. Jurisdiction

There are no court orders about any of the child(ren). No other Court has continuing jurisdiction over this
case or the child(ren).

Texas has authority to decide this case because: (Check one.)
[ml The children live in Texas now and have lived in Texas for at least the past 6 months or since birth.

[] The children do not live in Texas now, but they have been gone from Texas less than 6 months. The
children had lived in Texas for at least 6 months before they moved. A parent or person acting as a
parent continues to live in Texas.

Important: Talk to a lawyer if neither of the above applies.

M.2055

Note: If there is already a court order about any of the children, you may need to file a modification case instead
of a Suit Affecting the Parent-Child Relationship (SAPCR) case. Get information about filing a modification case

at www. TexasLawHelp.org.

IN THE 233RD DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT: 
I. INTRODUCTION
There comes a time in the journey of life when a man finds himself standing 
in the same muddy footprints he left as a child, gazing up at the same towering 
courthouse steps, and feeling that same sinking sensation in his chest. It’s a peculiar 
thing, this cycle of disappointment—to have lived it once as a bewildered child and 
then again as a rule-abiding adult. The faces change, the dates on the calendar 
advance, but the feeling remains as familiar as an old, worn book. 
Petitioner comes before this Court not with anger burning in his chest, nor 
with vindictiveness poisoning his pen, but rather with that quiet, heavy 
disappointment that settles in a person’s bones when they’ve done everything by

There comes a time in the journey of life when a man finds himself standing

courthouse steps, and feeling that same sinking sensation in his chest. It’s a peculiar
thing, this cycle of disappointment—to have lived it once as a bewildered child and

the book only to find the book itself has been shelved away, forgotten by those 
sworn to read from it.  
Petitioner followed the rules. He honored the procedures. He placed his faith 
in a system that promised justice would flow like water, clear and unobstructed, to 
those who seek it properly. He lived under the façade of facially void orders, and 
sustained extraordinary damages that were all caused intentionally by one person: 
the Respondent, who has sat in complete silence as this breakdown has continued 
to occur. 
Yet here stands Petitioner, a father twice removed—once from his home 
and once from his children—knocking on the courthouse door with papers properly 
filed, only to be told that the door shall remain closed because someone else might, 
at some future date, file papers at another door entirely. If this strikes the Court as 
a curious interpretation of justice, then we find ourselves in rare agreement. 
Mark Twain once observed that “the difference between the almost right word and 
the right word is really a large matter—it’s the difference between the lightning bug 
and the lightning.” In matters of law and children’s welfare, the difference between 
almost justice and actual justice is equally vast—it’s the difference between 
children thriving and children suffering, between a father’s presence and his 
absence, between following the law and merely gesturing toward it.  
The Petitioner is now in an extraordinary circumstance. On one hand, he

the book only to find the book itself has been shelved away, forgotten by those
sworn to read from it.

Petitioner followed the rules. He honored the procedures. He placed his faith
in a system that promised justice would flow like water, clear and unobstructed, to
those who seek it properly. He lived under the fagade of facially void orders, and
sustained extraordinary damages that were all caused intentionally by one person:
the Respondent, who has sat in complete silence as this breakdown has continued
to occur.

Yet here stands Petitioner, a father twice removed—once from his home

and once from his children—knocking on the courthouse door with papers properly
filed, only to be told that the door shall remain closed because someone else might,
at some future date, file papers at another door entirely. If this strikes the Court as
a curious interpretation of justice, then we find ourselves in rare agreement.
Mark Twain once observed that “the difference between the almost right word and
the right word is really a large matter—it’s the difference between the lightning bug
and the lightning.” In matters of law and children’s welfare, the difference between
almost justice and actual justice is equally vast—it’s the difference between
children thriving and children suffering, between a father’s presence and his
absence, between following the law and merely gesturing toward it.

The Petitioner is now in an extraordinary circumstance. On one hand, he

must seek mandamus relief respectfully compelling this Court to fulfill its

ministerial duty to hear and rule on Petitioner’s properly filed emergency TRO, 
which this Court refused to hear on March 28, 2025. The refusal came not from any 
defect in the filing itself, but solely from representations made by opposing counsel 
regarding a future filing in another court which she abandoned—a procedural 
sleight of hand that has left children in distress and a father without an adequate 
remedy for an appeal. 
On the other hand, the Petitioner must prohibit the 322nd District Court from 
setting a matter for a hearing that cannot bear a valid result through a concurrent 
Writ of Prohibition. The proper procedure wasn’t followed, and cannot be 
overlooked in the face of an emergency. 
 
In essence, a procedurally improper forward-looking consolidation motion 
to be filed in a different court was used to block a properly filed emergency TRO 
before this court. The court cannot rule on a case not before it, and mandamus is 
the proper remedy here if this court refuses to act. Given the extraordinary 
circumstances of this matter, and given there has been no response or opposition to 
the relief being requested, the court should grant the emergency TRO 
immediately through a written order delivered to all the parties via the 
electronic filing manager, set the matter for a hearing 14 days from the signing of 
the order, and require a written response from the opposing party no later than 7 
days prior to the hearing.

Despite the circumstances of this case, Petitioner feels that settlement will 
and could be a possibility in the future, but the priority remains to rebuild the status 
quo of the children that has been destroyed and regain the ability to provide for his 
children financially while damages are assessed and attended to. Petitioner is at the  
very least entitled to this immediate relief.  He is not asking this court for anything 
more than what it has the discretion to do and what the law demands that it must do 
given the circumstances. This intent to file mandamus is filed out of respect and 
serves as a notice to all parties of record of my position on this matter. 
Such absurdity should end with an order from this court in Petitioner’s 
favor, and in support thereof, he shows the following unopposed facts: 
II. STATEMENT OF FACTS 
1. On January 24, 2025, after more than 11 months of inaction, Petitioner 
filed a Motion to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution. The divorce case no 
substantive action from Respondent since April 2024, a legal ghost ship drifting 
without direction or purpose. That motion wasn’t attempted to be set for hearing 
until September of 2024, only after the Petitioner exhausted all efforts seeking 
relief throughout the Texas Judiciary without any participation from the opposing 
side. 
2. On March 19, 2025, driven by mounting concerns about the children’s 
welfare and learning that the 322nd District Court did not have continuous,

SAPCR in this Court (Cause No. 233-765358-25) seeking emergency relief for 
the children. The very next day, March 20, 2025, Ms. Carter suddenly reappeared 
like a character presumed missing in the second act, filing an answer to the 
SAPCR petition in this Court and thereby submitting to this Court’s jurisdiction 
by filing a response rather than a motion to abate. 
3. On March 21, 2025, Petitioner filed a verified Rule 12 motion 
challenging Ms. Carter’s authority to represent Respondent in this matter—the 
second such challenge, met with the same resounding silence as the first. 
4. On March 25, 2025, Petitioner filed an Objection to Consolidation and 
an Ex-Parte Emergency Motion for TRO. Two days later, on March 27, 2025, 
Petitioner contacted the court coordinator, requested a date and time to present the 
motion, and served the documents to the opposing party with the intent to present 
on March 28, 2025, at 9:00 A.M. before the Associate Judge of this Court. On that 
fateful morning of March 28, 2025, Petitioner drove to the courthouse, paid for 
parking, met with the coordinator, communicated with opposing counsel, and 
secured a hearing date of April 10, 2025. Petitioner then proceeded to the 
Associate Judge’s courtroom to present the TRO. 
5. Before Petitioner could present his case—before he could speak a single 
word about his children’s welfare—he was told that Ms. Carter would be filing a 
motion to consolidate in the 322nd District Court, that his motion was improperly 
before the court, and that the Associate Judge refused to hear the motion. It was a

curious thing, this refusal. Ms. Carter wasn’t even present in the courtroom, yet 
her words carried more weight than Petitioner’s physical presence, his properly 
filed papers, and most importantly, the urgent needs of his children. She stopped 
the proceedings with nothing more than word of mouth for the incorrect motion. 
A true showcasing of disregard for the process, and the children. 
6. On April 2, 2025, Petitioner filed a Pre-Objection to Motion to 
Consolidate in the 322nd District Court. Ms. Carter’s motion to consolidate wasn’t 
filed with the 322nd District Court until April 3, 2025—six days after she used its 
mere possibility to prevent this Court from hearing Petitioner’s emergency 
motion. Her motion disregarded Petitioner’s pre-objection entirely, as if it were 
invisible ink on the page. 
7. On April 4, 2025, unable to acquire a ruling due to Petitioner’s 
objection, Ms. Carter attempted to set the motion for a hearing before the 322nd 
District Court. That same day, Petitioner filed a Pre-Objection to Motion to 
Transfer in this Court, given that a motion to transfer must come before any 
attempt at consolidation. Ms. Carter, who had been so urgently concerned about 
consolidation when it served to block Petitioner’s emergency hearing, suddenly 
claimed to be unavailable until late April—causing significant delays that could 
have been avoided had this Court simply heard the motion before it on March 28, 
2025.

8. Throughout this period of procedural maneuvering, the children have 
been subjected to psychological manipulation and medical neglect. They have 
been removed from Petitioner’s care and placed with elderly great-grandparents 
on a daily basis, and are being gaslighted into a false belief that the divorce is 
finalized. Petitioner’s eldest child’s academic performance has plummeted, and 
both children have become emotionally estranged from both parents. Petitioner 
has suffered approximately $110,500 in verifiable financial damages due to being 
locked out of his home and business, and it grows each day. But the financial toll 
pales in comparison to the emotional cost of watching Petitioner’s children suffer 
while the courts exchange procedurally incorrect volleys over his head.  
III. ARGUMENT 
A. The Court's Ministerial Duty 
9. It is well-established Texas law that a trial court has a ministerial 
duty—not a discretionary duty—to consider and rule upon motions properly filed 
and pending before it. In re Sheppard, 193 S.W.3d 181, 183 (Tex. App.—Houston 
[1st Dist.] 2006, orig. proceeding); In re Chavez, 62 S.W.3d 225, 228 (Tex. 
App.—Amarillo 2001, orig. proceeding). The Texas Supreme Court has 
consistently held that while a court has discretion in how it rules on a motion, it 
has no discretion to refuse to rule at all. In re Blakeney, 254 S.W.3d 659, 661 
(Tex. App.—Texarkana 2008, orig. proceeding) ("When a motion is properly

duty—not a discretionary duty—to consider and rule upon motions properly filed
and pending before it. In re Sheppard, 193 S.W.3d 181, 183 (Tex. App.—Houston

consistently held that while a court has discretion in how it rules on a motion, it
has no discretion to refuse to rule at all. In re Blakeney, 254 S.W.3d 659, 661

motion is a ministerial act, and mandamus may issue to compel the trial judge to 
act."). 
10. This principle is not merely a procedural nicety but a fundamental 
cornerstone of our judicial system. When a court refuses to hear a properly filed 
motion, it effectively denies access to justice itself. As the Texas courts have 
repeatedly emphasized, "A trial court's refusal to rule on a pending motion within 
a reasonable amount of time constitutes a clear abuse of discretion." In re Bonds, 
57 S.W.3d 456, 457 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2001, orig. proceeding). This 
abuse is magnified exponentially when the motion concerns the welfare of 
children and seeks emergency relief. 
11. The Court's refusal to hear Petitioner's properly filed emergency TRO 
on March 28, 2025, constitutes a clear failure to perform a ministerial duty. This 
failure is particularly concerning given that: 
a) The motion was properly filed and noticed for hearing and the parties agreed 
on a date and time set for April 10th, 2025; 
b) Petitioner communicated with court staff, physically appeared at the 
courthouse ready to present the motion and was told he could present his 
motion; 
    c) The motion concerned the immediate welfare of children; and 
    d) The refusal was based solely on representations about a future filing in 
another court that had not yet occurred.

B. Clear Abuse of Discretion 
12. A writ of mandamus is appropriate when a trial court clearly abuses its 
discretion and there is no adequate remedy by appeal. In re Prudential Ins. Co. of 
Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 135-36 (Tex. 2004); Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 
840 (Tex. 1992). An abuse if discretion is clearly established from point one 
below, and supported by points two through eight: 
i. First, it refused to perform its ministerial duty to hear and 
rule on a properly filed motion based solely on representations 
about a future filing in another court. It’s as if a doctor refused to 
treat a bleeding patient because another doctor might, at some 
future date, claim the patient should be treated at a different 
hospital. 
ii. Second, it failed to recognize that by answering the 
SAPCR petition in this Court, Respondent submitted to this 
Court’s jurisdiction and should have instead filed a motion to abate 
or should have moved to transfer the case. The law doesn’t allow 
for half-measures of jurisdiction. 
iii. Third, it failed to recognize that this Court maintained 
jurisdiction until any transfer was completed pursuant to Texas 
Family Code § 155.005(d) as no final order has been rendered in 
the 322nd District Court. Jurisdiction isn’t a hot potato to be

dropped at the first mention of another court—it’s a solemn 
responsibility that remains until properly transferred.  
iv. Fourth, it failed to recognize that the proper procedure 
for consolidation of cases in different courts requires a motion to 
transfer to be filed and granted before any motion to consolidate 
can be considered, pursuant to Texas Family Code §§ 155.201 and 
6.407. The law provides a sequence, a proper order of operations, 
that cannot be reversed or circumvented without creating 
procedural delay, which is what the emergency TRO sought to 
prevent from occurring. 
v. Fifth, it allowed opposing counsel to circumvent proper 
legal procedure by influencing this Court’s decision without being 
present and without having filed any response to the emergency 
TRO properly before this Court. It’s as if the referee in a football 
game made a call based on what someone in the parking lot said 
might happen in the fourth quarter when she had the rules of the

vi. Sixth, it failed to consider that the purported “agreed”

shadow on the wall. No court has continuous, exclusive 
jurisdiction over the children in this matter. 
vii. Seventh, it failed to recognize that the Associate 
Judge’s orders in the divorce case were never properly adopted by 
the referring District Court as required by Texas Family Code § 
201.013(b). An unadopted order is like an unsigned check—it may 
look official, but it carries no legal weight, yet it has been used to 
bar the Petitioner from his residence, business, and children, and 
impose a disruptive and chaotic schedule upon the children. 
viii. Eighth, and perhaps most troublingly, it disregarded 
the children’s best interests in favor of procedural considerations, 
contrary to Texas Family Code § 153.002 and has languished for 
over a year due to the opposition’s failure to prosecute. 
 
12. The law is clear that in matters involving children, their welfare must 
be the court’s primary consideration—not procedural niceties, not docket 
management, and certainly not the convenience of opposing counsel. 
C. No Adequate Remedy by Appeal 
13. When Justice Delayed Is Justice Denied Petitioner has no adequate 
remedy by appeal for reasons that should stir the conscience of any court: The

vii. Seventh, it failed to recognize that the Associate
Judge’s orders in the divorce case were never properly adopted by
the referring District Court as required by Texas Family Code §
201.013(b). An unadopted order is like an unsigned check—it may
look official, but it carries no legal weight, yet it has been used to
bar the Petitioner from his residence, business, and children, and
impose a disruptive and chaotic schedule upon the children.

viii. Eighth, and perhaps most troublingly, it disregarded
the children’s best interests in favor of procedural considerations,
contrary to Texas Family Code § 153.002 and has languished for

over a year due to the opposition’s failure to prosecute.

12. The law is clear that in matters involving children, their welfare must
be the court’s primary consideration—not procedural niceties, not docket
management, and certainly not the convenience of opposing counsel.

C. No Adequate Remedy by Appeal

13. When Justice Delayed Is Justice Denied Petitioner has no adequate

remedy by appeal for reasons that should stir the conscience of any court: The

emergency nature of the injunctive relief sought requires immediate action, as

Petitioner’s children are suffering immediate and ongoing harm while procedural 
issues remain unresolved. In re Texas Dep’t of Family & Protective Servs., 255 
S.W.3d 613, 615 (Tex. 2008) (granting emergency relief where children’s welfare 
was at immediate risk). Petitioner’s children are being alienated from him, 
causing long-term psychological damage that cannot be undone by a favorable 
ruling months or years in the future. In re Scheller, 325 S.W.3d 640, 643 (Tex. 
2010) (recognizing that interference with the parent-child relationship can 
constitute irreparable harm). 
14. The improper procedural maneuvers by opposing counsel are causing 
significant delays that cannot be remedied through the normal appellate process. 
Each day that passes is another day the children suffer, another day their academic 
performance declines, another day they become more emotionally estranged in a 
situation that the law should’ve prevented from existing to begin with. 
15. Temporary orders in family law cases are generally not appealable, 
leaving Petitioner in a procedural trap with no exit. Waiting for a final judgment 
to appeal would allow the improper procedural tactics to succeed, causing 
irreparable harm to Petitioner and his children. 
16. Void orders are being enforced against Petitioner, causing ongoing 
harm that cannot be adequately remedied by appeal. In re Sw. Bell Tel. Co., 35

D. Opposing Counsel’s Contradictory Behavior 
17. Cooper L. Carter’s contradictory behavior warrants particular 
attention, like a character in a novel whose actions never quite align with their 
words: She zealously defended her client by filing an answer to the SAPCR in this 
Court, thereby submitting to this Court’s jurisdiction, only to then influence this 
Court to refuse to hear Petitioner’s properly filed motion by representing that she 
would file a motion to consolidate in the 322nd Court, which would be moot by 
statute. 
18. She had abandoned the divorce case for nearly a year, filing nothing 
since April 24, 2024, only to suddenly reappear precisely when I sought 
emergency relief for the children—like a firefighter who ignores a smoldering 
house for months, only to rush in when someone else calls for help. She failed to 
respond to a Rule 12 motion challenging her authority to represent 
the Respondent, her silence speaking volumes about the nature of her 
representation. She subsequently filed an improper motion to consolidate in the 
322nd Court without first filing the required motion to transfer, putting the 
procedural cart before the horse. She is now claiming unavailability until late 
April in the 322nd Court, creating unnecessary delay after using the urgency of 
consolidation to block Petitioner’s emergency hearing.

19. This pattern demonstrates a tactical attempt to manipulate both courts’ 
dockets to prevent me from obtaining a timely hearing on Petitioner’s properly 
filed emergency motion. It’s a shell game played with the children’s welfare as 
the prize. This Court should not allow itself to be used as an instrument in such 
procedural gamesmanship, particularly when it involves a failure to perform a 
ministerial duty required by law and when children’s welfare is at stake. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
 
This Court’s refusal to hear Petitioner’s properly filed motion constitutes a 
failure to perform a ministerial duty for which there is no adequate remedy 
by appeal. The proper legal procedure requires a motion to transfer to be 
filed and granted before any motion to consolidate can be considered, and by 
answering the SAPCR petition in this Court, Respondent submitted to this 
Court’s jurisdiction. 
The children who are the subject of this proceeding are suffering 
immediate and ongoing harm while procedural issues remain unresolved. Each 
day that passes without addressing the emergency concerns raised in Petitioner’s 
TRO is a day of certain damage to the children’s psychological well-being and 
development.

how it treats its most vulnerable members. By that measure, the procedural

motion speaks volumes about how far we have strayed from the ideal of justice. 
The children— innocent, vulnerable, and deserving of the Court’s protection—
have instead become collateral damage in a game of procedural chess. 
Petitioner provides this petition not out of anger or vindictiveness, but out 
of that quiet, heavy disappointment that settles in a person’s bones when they’ve 
done everything by the book only to find the book itself has been shelved away. 
Petitioner followed the rules. He reiterates that he honored the procedures. He 
placed his faith in a system that promised justice would flow like water, clear and 
unobstructed, to those who seek it properly. 
Petitioner asks this Court to remember that behind every case number, 
behind every filing, behind every procedural rule, there are often real children 
with real lives that continue whether the courts act or not. Time doesn’t stop for 
them while adults sort out procedural disagreements. They grow, they hurt, they 
form memories and impressions that will shape them for a lifetime. 
As Mark Twain might have observed, the difference between justice 
served and justice delayed is the difference between a father’s presence and his 
absence, between children thriving and children suffering, between following the 
law and merely gesturing toward it.

TO THE HONORABLE COURT: 
 
Petitioner, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, PRE-OBJECTS to any motion to transfer filed  
on behalf of COOPER L. CARTER in this matter, and in support thereof, shows the following: 
I. INTRODUCTION 
1. On March 28, 2025, Petitioner set a properly filed motion to be heard in front of the 
associate Judge. 
2. Petitioner was denied an opportunity to be heard due to the claim that COOPER L.  
CARTER would be filing a motion to consolidate in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County  
as justification for the denial of due process. 
 
3. On April 2nd, 2025, Petitioner filed a PRE-OBJECTION laying out the legal reasons  
why COOPER L. CARTER’s consolidation motion was improper, and premature. 
 
4. COOPER L. CARTER cannot move to consolidate this matter with the divorce suit  
pending before the 322nd District Court because the Texas Family Code 6.407(b) explicitly  
states: 
“On the transfer of the proceedings, the court with jurisdiction of the suit for dissolution of a 
marriage shall consolidate the two causes of action.”

Petitioner,
PETITIONER’S PRE-OBJECTION TO
MOTION TO TRANSFER
MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS,

Respondent.

2025-04-04

TO THE HONORABLE COURT:
Petitioner, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, PRE-OBJECTS to any motion to transfer filed
on behalf of COOPER L. CARTER in this matter, and in support thereof, shows the following:
I. INTRODUCTION

1. On March 28, 2025, Petitioner set a properly filed motion to be heard in front of the
associate Judge.

2. Petitioner was denied an opportunity to be heard due to the claim that COOPER L.
CARTER would be filing a motion to consolidate in the 322™ District Court of Tarrant County
as justification for the denial of due process.

3. On April 2"¢, 2025, Petitioner filed a PRE-OBJECTION laying out the legal reasons
why COOPER L. CARTER’s consolidation motion was improper, and premature.

4. COOPER L. CARTER cannot move to consolidate this matter with the divorce suit
pending before the 322" District Court because the Texas Family Code 6.407(b) explicitly
States:

“On the transfer of the proceedings, the court with jurisdiction of the suit for dissolution of a
marriage shall consolidate the two causes of action.”

M.2085 M.2085

=== PAGE 82 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
 
5. Therefore, COOPER L. CARTER’s motion to consolidate is procedurally improper, and was  
used as a tool to interfere with emergency proceedings where no answer was provided. 
 
6. The court cannot refuse to hear a properly filed motion before it and give deference to an  
improperly filed motion notwithstanding COOPER L. CARTER’s misconduct and failure to prosecute the  
divorce suit. 
II. CONCLUSION 
 
7. For these reasons, Petitioner respectfully OBJECTS to any motion to transfer filed on behalf of  
COOPER L. CARTER. 
 
8. Furthermore, before any motion to transfer is to be set by COOPER L. CARTER, her authority  
pursuant to Rule 12 should be resolved by citing COOPER L. CARTER to appear and prove her authority  
to represent the Respondent in this matter.

6. The court cannot refuse to hear a properly filed motion before it and give deference to an

improperly filed motion notwithstanding COOPER L. CARTER’s misconduct and failure to prosecute the

divorce suit.

Il. CONCLUSION

7. For these reasons, Petitioner respectfully OBJECTS to any motion to transfer filed on behalf of
COOPER L. CARTER.

8. Furthermore, before any motion to transfer is to be set by COOPER L. CARTER, her authority

pursuant to Rule 12 should be resolved by citing COOPER L. CARTER to appear and prove her authority

to represent the Respondent in this matter.

Respectfully submitted,

NO. 322-744263-23 
IN THE 322nd DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
TO THE HONORABLE COURT: 
Under Texas law, the doctrine of dominant jurisdiction dictates that when two suits 
involving the same parties and subject matter are filed in courts of concurrent jurisdiction, the 
court where the suit was first filed typically acquires exclusive control. However, this 
presumption can be overcome by showing that the first suit was initiated in bad faith or for the 
purpose of delay. Texas courts, following the rule established in Wyatt v. Shaw Plumbing Co., 
recognize exceptions where the first suit was filed merely to establish procedural priority, in 
anticipation of subsequent litigation, or to stall the opposing party’s legitimate claims. These 
principles provide a vital check against strategic abuse of court processes and ensure 
jurisdictional fairness when forum manipulation is evident. 
This analysis looks into the circumstances surrounding this matter, and is presented in a 
good-faith effort to provide insight to the court.

Dominant Jurisdiction Analysis with Bad Faith Focus 
I. Legal Framework for Dominant Jurisdiction 
A. General Principles 
Under Texas law, the doctrine of dominant jurisdiction provides that when two suits are 
pending in courts of concurrent jurisdiction involving the same parties and subject matter, the 
court in which the suit was first filed acquires dominant jurisdiction to the exclusion of the other 
court. This doctrine is established in the seminal case of Curtis v. Gibbs, 511 S.W.2d 263 (Tex. 
1974), where the Texas Supreme Court held that any subsequent suit involving the same parties 
and controversy must be dismissed if a party to that suit calls the second court's attention to the 
pendency of the prior suit. 
B. Bad Faith Exception 
However, Texas courts recognize an important exception to the dominant jurisdiction 
doctrine: when the first-filed suit was brought in bad faith or for the purpose of delay. As 
established in Wyatt v. Shaw Plumbing Co., 760 S.W.2d 245, 248 (Tex. 1988), the first court's 
dominant jurisdiction can be defeated by showing that the first suit was filed: 
1. As a mere pretext to establish priority; 
2. In anticipation of the second suit; 
3. For the purpose of delay; or 
4. In bad faith. 
When this exception applies, the second court may proceed with its case despite the pendency of 
the first-filed suit.

C. Procedural Manipulation
1. Strategic Delays and Attorney Changes
•
At the January 22, 2024 hearing, Morgan appeared without counsel
•
She hired Cooper L. Carter on the spot in the courtroom lobby to cause further
delay
•
This tactic successfully delayed the case until February 1, further prejudicing
Charles
2. Self-Help Tactics Outside Legal Process
•
On March 6, 2024, Morgan illegally locked Charles outside the home
•
This occurred after Charles had filed notice with the court that he would not leave
until after the hearing
•
This demonstrated willingness to circumvent legal process
3. Systematic Non-Prosecution
•
After securing favorable temporary orders, Morgan's counsel ceased prosecuting

to secure tactical advantages
III. Application of Bad Faith Exception to Current Case
A. Legal Analysis
The facts of this case align precisely with the bad faith exception outlined in Wyatt v. Shaw 
Plumbing Co. The initial divorce filing shows clear evidence of being: 
1. A mere pretext to establish priority: The coordinated preparation of documents with
Dan Branthoover before any legitimate attempt at reconciliation or mediation
demonstrates the filing was pretextual.
2. Filed in anticipation of potential action by Charles: The timing of the filing after
Charles discovered evidence of an affair suggests anticipatory filing to gain tactical
advantage.
3. For the purpose of delay: The systematic non-prosecution of the case for nearly a year
after securing favorable temporary orders demonstrates the purpose was not resolution
but delay.
4. In bad faith: The numerous false statements in court filings, including claims about
protective orders, family violence, and financial status, constitute clear bad faith.

•
Court held that "filing a lawsuit for an improper purpose, such as to harass, cause
unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation, is sanctionable
conduct."
•
The pattern of behavior in the initial divorce filing aligns with this standard.
2. Perry v. Del Rio, 66 S.W.3d 239, 252 (Tex. 2001)
•
The Texas Supreme Court recognized that "the first-filed rule should not be
applied inflexibly or when doing so would reward gamesmanship or ill motive."
•
Morgan's coordinated preparation of divorce filings while misleading Charles
about her intentions constitutes precisely the kind of gamesmanship courts should
not reward.
3. Gonzalez v. Reliant Energy, Inc., 159 S.W.3d 615, 622 (Tex. 2005)
•
Court held that dominant jurisdiction does not apply when the first suit is filed "in
anticipation of the second suit and in an effort to subvert the second action."
•
The timing and coordination with Dan Branthoover suggest the divorce was filed
in anticipation of potential action by Charles after discovering the affair.
C. Family Law Context
In family law matters, courts have been particularly vigilant about bad faith filings due to their 
impact on children and families:

welfare.
•
The false allegations of family violence and protective orders directly implicate
this concern.
2. In re Sims, 88 S.W.3d 297, 303-04 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2002, orig. proceeding)
•
Court held that in SAPCR cases, the best interest of the child can override strict
application of dominant jurisdiction.
•
The systematic non-prosecution of the case has prevented resolution, contrary to
the children's best interests.
IV. Implications for Current Proceedings
A. Legal Consequences of Bad Faith Finding
If the court determines the initial divorce filing was made in bad faith, several significant legal 
consequences follow: 
1. Dominant Jurisdiction Defeated: The 233rd District Court would not be bound by the
dominant jurisdiction of the 322nd District Court where the divorce was filed.
2. Consolidation Order Invalidated: The consolidation order would be invalid not only for
procedural defects but also because it erroneously applied dominant jurisdiction
principles to a bad faith filing.
3. Independent Proceeding Permitted: Charles's SAPCR filing in the 233rd District Court
could proceed independently, unaffected by the prior divorce filing.

4. Potential for Sanctions: The court could consider sanctions against Morgan and/or her
counsel for the bad faith filing and misrepresentations to the court.
B. Strategic Approach for Rehearing Motion
In the motion for rehearing, the bad faith analysis should be presented as an independent, 
alternative ground for mandamus relief: 
1. Primary Argument: The consolidation order should be vacated due to procedural defects
(lack of notice, hearing, proper transfer).
2. Alternative Argument: Even if procedurally proper, consolidation was improper
because the first-filed suit's dominant jurisdiction was defeated by bad faith.
3. Relief Requested: The court should:
•
Vacate the consolidation order
•
Recognize the 233rd District Court's authority to proceed independently with the
SAPCR
•
Order the trial court to hear Charles's emergency TRO on its merits
V. Conclusion
The doctrine of dominant jurisdiction is not an absolute rule but a principle of judicial 
efficiency that yields when its application would reward bad faith or procedural gamesmanship. 
The extensive evidence of coordination before filing, false statements in court documents, and 
systematic non-prosecution after securing favorable orders demonstrates that the initial divorce 
filing was made in bad faith.

4. Potential for Sanctions: The court could consider sanctions against Morgan and/or her

counsel for the bad faith filing and misrepresentations to the court.

B. Strategic Approach for Rehearing Motion

In the motion for rehearing, the bad faith analysis should be presented as an independent,

alternative ground for mandamus relief:

1. Primary Argument: The consolidation order should be vacated due to procedural defects

(lack of notice, hearing, proper transfer).

2. Alternative Argument: Even if procedurally proper, consolidation was improper

because the first-filed suit's dominant jurisdiction was defeated by bad faith.

3. Relief Requested: The court should:

e Vacate the consolidation order

e Recognize the 233rd District Court's authority to proceed independently with the

SAPCR

e Order the trial court to hear Charles's emergency TRO on its merits

Y. Conclusion

The doctrine of dominant jurisdiction is not an absolute rule but a principle of judicial
efficiency that yields when its application would reward bad faith or procedural gamesmanship.
The extensive evidence of coordination before filing, false statements in court documents, and
systematic non-prosecution after securing favorable orders demonstrates that the initial divorce

filing was made in bad faith.

Under Texas law, this bad faith defeats any claim of dominant jurisdiction by the 322nd District 
Court. Consequently, the consolidation order was not only procedurally defective but 
substantively erroneous in its application of dominant jurisdiction principles. The Court of 
Appeals should grant rehearing and issue mandamus relief to prevent the trial court from 
rewarding this bad faith through improper consolidation.
