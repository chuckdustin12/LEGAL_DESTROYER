Hi Charles, 
Thank you for your interest in our property. We usually don·t 
allow bookings from guests without at least 5 reviews from 
other hosts. To help us decide if the property is suitable for 
you, could you please share more information about yourself 
and your trip? Also, may I know who will be staying with you 
and if you expect any visitors during your stay? I hope you 
don·t mind as it is my way of getting to know my guests a bit 
better. 
I'm sure that the property would have all the amenities you 
need but feel free to double-check and let me know if there·s 
anything specific that you think is very essential for your stay. 
Also as a gentle reminder, please take a moment to look 
through the House Rules. I look forward to hearing from you. 
Thanks!
