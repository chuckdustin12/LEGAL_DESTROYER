TO THE HONORABLE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS:

Relator CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS respectfully submits this motion for
rehearing regarding cause number 25-0378 before this Honorable Court.

There exist five judges involved in the same family law matter before this
Court, none of which have provided a response, and the case remains inactive in
the trial court below.

Because there has been no response, Relator will file a motion similar to this
in case numbers 25-0361, 25-0367, 25-0426, and 25-0458 to incorporate potential

counter arguments and why they fail. This Court should grant mandamus relief for

cause number 25-0378, and in support of this request, Relator Charles Dustin 
Myers shows the following: 
I. 
Introduction 
 
1. The motion for rehearing in Charles Dustin Myers' mandamus petition 
should be granted because the trial court clearly abused its discretion by violating 
mandatory local rules and denying due process, and Relator lacks an adequate 
appellate remedy due to the extraordinary circumstances involving his parental 
rights. 
II. Summary 
 
2. Relator’s motion for rehearing regarding his petition for writ of 
mandamus warrants granting because the circumstances present both elements 
required for mandamus relief: a clear abuse of discretion by the trial court and the 
absence of an adequate remedy by appeal. Judge Kenneth Newell of the 233rd 
District Court clearly abused his discretion by granting a contested consolidation 
motion in violation of Tarrant County Local Rule 4.01(8)(a), which expressly 
requires consolidation motions to be filed and heard in the earliest-filed case. The 
sua sponte nature of the ruling, made without notice or hearing and in disregard of 
Relator’s timely objections, further constitutes a violation of due process that the 
trial court had no discretion to commit.

2. Relator’s motion for rehearing regarding his petition for writ of

3. Additionally, Relator lacks an adequate remedy by appeal because the 
improper consolidation creates extraordinary circumstances that threaten his 
substantial parental rights. The procedural irregularities, including the suspicious 
timing of the consolidation order issued immediately after Relator sought 
mandamus relief for a related matter, suggest a pattern of judicial action that 
impairs his ability to present his case effectively. Given the fundamental nature of 
parental rights at stake and the difficulty in quantifying harm from an improper 
consolidation after trial, allowing this procedural error to stand would subject 
Relator to continued irreparable harm (which it has) that cannot be adequately 
remedied through the normal appellate process.  
III. Background and Relevant Law 
A. Standard for Motions for Rehearing in Mandamus Proceedings 
 
4. In Texas, motions for rehearing in mandamus proceedings must satisfy 
strict criteria to warrant reconsideration. Generally, a motion for rehearing must 
"identify with particularity findings of fact or conclusions of law that are the 
subject of the complaint and any evidentiary or legal ruling claimed to be 
erroneous" and "state the legal and factual basis for the claimed error." Tex. Gov't. 
Code § 2001.146 (2025). The motion must demonstrate specific errors in the 
court's analysis or application of the law to justify reconsideration.

5. In administrative contexts, which provide guidance by analogy, a motion 
for rehearing should be denied if it lacks specific grounds. As 7 Tex. Admin. Code 
§ 105.17 (2025) provides, "In the absence of specific grounds in the motion, the 
Commissioner shall presume that the motion should be overruled." Similarly, 
regulatory provisions emphasize that motions for rehearing must identify "with 
particularity findings of fact or conclusions of law that are the subject of the 
complaint and any evidentiary or legal ruling claimed to be erroneous" and "state 
the legal and factual basis for the claimed error." 16 Tex. Admin. Code § 
60.309 (2025). 
 
6. For mandamus relief specifically, Texas courts consistently apply a two-
prong test: the relator must demonstrate (1) that the trial court clearly abused its 
discretion and (2) that the relator lacks an adequate remedy by appeal. In re 
Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 135-36 (Tex. 2004). A trial court 
clearly abuses its discretion if "it reaches a decision so arbitrary and unreasonable 
as to amount to a clear and prejudicial error of law." Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 
833, 839 (Tex. 1992). 
B. Clear Abuse of Discretion 
 
7. A trial court abuses its discretion when it fails to analyze or apply the law 
correctly. As explained in Perry v. Del Rio, 66 S.W.3d 239, 257 (Tex. 2001): "A 
trial court has no 'discretion' in determining what the law is or applying the law to

clearly abuses its discretion if "it reaches a decision so arbitrary and unreasonable
as to amount to a clear and prejudicial error of law." Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d

7. A trial court abuses its discretion when it fails to analyze or apply the law

the facts," and "erroneous legal conclusion, even in an unsettled area of law, is an 
abuse of discretion." This principle is particularly relevant when a trial court 
disregards established rules or denies fundamental due process rights. 
 
8. In Dal-Briar Corp. v. Baskette, 833 S.W.2d 612, 616 (Tex. App. 1992), the 
court clarified that while reviewing courts give deference to a trial court's factual 
determinations, "A trial court possesses no discretion to determine what the law is. 
A clear failure of the trial court to correctly analyze or apply the law will constitute 
an abuse of discretion with resulting reversal by extraordinary writ." Although this 
case was later abrogated, this concept still applies in regard to abuse of discretion. 
C. Adequacy of Appellate Remedy 
 
9. The second prong—whether an adequate appellate remedy exists—
requires a careful balancing of jurisprudential considerations. As the court 
explained in In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025): "Whether a 
remedy is adequate precluding mandamus review depends heavily on the 
circumstances, and that determination requires a balancing of jurisprudential 
considerations... An adequate appellate remedy exists when any benefits to 
mandamus review are outweighed by the detriments. Conversely, the requirement 
that there be no other adequate remedy by law is met when parties are in danger of 
permanently losing substantial rights."

10. The Texas Supreme Court has recognized that certain extraordinary 
circumstances may render an appellate remedy inadequate, particularly when 
fundamental rights are at stake. As explained in In re Van Waters & Rogers, Inc., 
145 S.W.3d 203, 211 (Tex. 2004): "An appeal is inadequate when parties are in 
danger of permanently losing substantial rights. Such a danger arises when the 
appellate court would not be able to cure the error, when the party's ability to 
present a viable claim or defense is vitiated, or when the error cannot be made part 
of the appellate record." 
 
11. In the context of parental rights specifically, the Texas Supreme Court 
has recognized that mandamus relief is appropriate where a trial court's order 
improperly affects such rights: "And we previously have granted relief to require a 
trial court to vacate orders erroneously permitting nonparents access to a child over 
a fit parent's objection... after concluding that the temporary orders 'divest[ed] a fit 
parent of possession of his children,' we observed that '[s]uch a divestiture is 
irremediable, and mandamus relief is therefore appropriate.'" In re C.J.C., 603 
S.W.3d 804 (Tex. 2020).

compelling. The petition identifies with particularity clear legal errors by the trial 
court that warrant mandamus relief. 
E. Clear Abuse of Discretion by Trial Court 
 
13. The record demonstrates that Judge Newell clearly abused his discretion 
in multiple ways: 
 
i. 
The trial court violated Tarrant County Local Rule 4.01(8)(a),  
 
 
which unambiguously mandates that "every motion  
 
 
 
to...consolidate...shall be filed in the earliest-filed case and the  
 
 
motion shall be heard in the earliest-filed case." (emphasis  
 
 
added). This rule is mandatory, not discretionary. Despite this  
 
 
clear directive, Judge Newell in the 233rd District Court (the  
 
 
later-filed case) granted the motion to  consolidate, usurping the  
 
 
authority that properly belonged to the 322nd District Court  
 
 
where the divorce proceeding (the first-filed case) was pending. 
 
14. As established in In re Christus Spohn Hosp. Kleberg, 222 S.W.3d 434, 
437 (Tex. 2007) and noted in Relator’s petition, "trial courts are required to follow 
local rules." The trial court had no discretion to disregard this procedural 
requirement, and doing so constitutes a clear abuse of discretion. 
ii. 
Judge Newell granted the contested consolidation motion sua

ruling and without holding a hearing on Relator’s timely filed 
objections. This procedural shortcut deprived Relator of his 
fundamental right to be heard on a potentially case-dispositive 
motion, which constitutes a denial of due process. 
 
15. As recognized in In re J.B. Hunt Transp., Inc., 492 S.W.3d 287, 299-300 
(Tex. 2016), "due process requires notice and an opportunity to be heard at a 
meaningful time and in a meaningful manner." The trial court's failure to provide 
this basic procedural protection is a clear abuse of discretion. 
iii. 
The suspicious timing of the consolidation order—issued 
moments after Myers sought mandamus relief from the Court of 
Appeals regarding the Associate Judge's refusal to hear his 
Emergency TRO—suggests the order may have been issued to 
frustrate appellate review. This pattern of procedural 
maneuvering further supports finding an abuse of discretion. 
F. No Adequate Remedy by Appeal 
 
16. The second prong—the lack of an adequate appellate remedy—is also 
satisfied in Myers' case for several compelling reasons: 
 
i.  
Extraordinary Circumstances: While consolidation orders  
 
 
typically do not warrant mandamus relief, In re Van Waters &

"if 'extraordinary circumstances' are present that make an  
 
 
ordinary appeal inadequate, mandamus relief may be  
 
 
 
warranted." The circumstances here—including multiple   
 
 
procedural irregularities, the apparent pattern of denying   
 
 
Relator a meaningful opportunity to be heard, and the  
 
 
 
fundamental parental rights at stake—qualify as extraordinary. 
 
ii.  
Danger of Permanently Losing Substantial Rights: Relator’s 
 
 
petition implicates his fundamental parental rights and his  
 
 
ability to protect his children's welfare. As the court recognized  
 
 
in In re J.H., 02-21-00124-CV (Tex. App. Jul 15, 2021),   
 
 
mandamus is appropriate when it "will preserve important  
 
 
substantive and procedural rights from impairment or loss" and  
 
 
when "the party's ability to present a viable claim or defense is  
 
 
vitiated, or when the error cannot be made a part of the   
 
 
appellate record." 
 
iii.  
The prejudice from an improper consolidation in a family law  
 
 
context involving children's custody is difficult to quantify and  
 
 
may be impossible to fully remedy on appeal. As noted in Dal-

consolidation after trial." Once a trial proceeds under an   
 
 
improper consolidation, the intertwining of evidence and issues  
 
 
may make it virtually impossible to disentangle on appeal. 
iv. 
Allowing a trial to proceed based on a clearly improper 
consolidation order would waste judicial resources and impose 
unnecessary burdens on Relator. This Court has recognized that 
mandamus is appropriate "to spare parties and the public the 
time and money utterly wasted enduring eventual reversal of 
improperly conducted proceedings." In re USAA, 307 S.W.3d 
299, 314 (Tex. 2010). 
v. 
The fact that Relator has received nine per curiam denials from 
the Second Court of Appeals "concerning the same set of 
underlying facts and without any opposition from the opposing 
party or the judges below" suggests that ordinary appellate 
processes have thus far failed to provide Relator with a 
meaningful opportunity to be heard or to correct clear abuses of

G. New Analysis of Local Rule Violation 
 
18. The court may not have fully appreciated the mandatory nature of 
Tarrant County Local Rule 4.01(8)(a) and its significance to the orderly 
administration of justice. This clear violation of a mandatory procedural rule 
constitutes a legal error that warrants reconsideration. 
H. Due Process Concerns 
 
19.  The fact that Relator was denied notice and an opportunity to be heard 
on his objections to consolidation raises significant due process concerns that the 
court should address. As the Court stated in In re Williams, 05-25-00273-CR (Tex. 
App. Apr 28, 2025), entitlement to mandamus relief requires "showing that the trial 
court clearly abused its discretion and that relator lacks an adequate appellate 
remedy." The denial of basic procedural rights constitutes such an abuse of 
discretion.

J. Extraordinary Circumstances 
 
21. The court should reevaluate whether the totality of circumstances—
including the procedural irregularities, the fundamental rights at stake, and the 
pattern of judicial action that appears to be frustrating Relator’s ability to obtain 
meaningful review—constitute “extraordinary circumstances” warranting 
mandamus relief under In re Van Waters & Rogers, Inc., 145 S.W.3d at 211 (Tex. 
2004). 
VI. Potential Arguments 
 
22. While there are strong grounds for granting Myers' motion for rehearing, 
several potential counterarguments should be considered: 
K. Deference to Trial Court Procedural Rulings 
 
23. Courts generally give significant deference to trial courts in managing 
their dockets and procedural matters. However, this deference is not unlimited and 
does not extend to clear violations of mandatory rules or denials of due process. 
L. Consolidation as Discretionary 
 
24. While trial courts have discretion regarding whether to consolidate 
related cases, they do not have discretion to violate the procedural requirements 
governing how consolidation motions must be filed and heard.

J. Extraordinary Circumstances

21. The court should reevaluate whether the totality of circumstances—
including the procedural irregularities, the fundamental rights at stake, and the
pattern of judicial action that appears to be frustrating Relator’s ability to obtain
meaningful review—constitute “extraordinary circumstances” warranting
mandamus relief under Jn re Van Waters & Rogers, Inc., 145 S.W.3d at 211 (Tex.
2004).

VI. Potential Arguments

M. Eventual Appeal as Remedy 
 
25. It could be argued that Myers could eventually appeal the final judgment 
and raise the improper consolidation at that time. However, as noted in Dal-Briar 
Corp. v. Baskette, 833 S.W.2d at 616 (Tex. App. 1992), there is significant 
difficulty in showing harm from improper consolidation after trial, making this an 
inadequate remedy. 
N. Standard for Rehearing 
 
26. While 40 Tex. Admin. Code § 823.32 (2025) and 40 Tex. Admin. Code § 
807.394 (2025) suggest that rehearings are generally granted "only for the 
presentation of new evidence," these administrative provisions are not directly 
applicable to mandamus proceedings in the Supreme Court, which instead focus on 
correcting clear abuses of discretion by lower courts, which is the case here across 
all five petitions. 
O. Timing Limitations 
 
27. Gambill v. State, 692 S.W.2d 106 (Tex. Crim. App. 1985) cautions 
against "belatedly present[ing] new grounds in such piecemeal fashion." However, 
Myers is not presenting new grounds but rather seeking reconsideration of his 
original petition based on the same grounds of clear abuse of discretion and lack of 
adequate appellate remedy.

VII. Conclusion 
 
28. Based on the foregoing analysis, there are compelling grounds for 
granting Charles Dustin Myers' motion for rehearing regarding his petition for writ 
of mandamus. The trial court clearly abused its discretion by violating mandatory 
local rules and denying Relator due process, and Relator lacks an adequate 
appellate remedy due to the extraordinary circumstances involving his fundamental 
parental rights. 
 
29. The violation of Tarrant County Local Rule 4.01(8)(a) alone constitutes a 
clear abuse of discretion, as the trial court had no discretion to ignore this 
mandatory procedural requirement. The added procedural irregularities—including 
the sua sponte nature of the ruling, the lack of notice or hearing, and the suspicious 
timing—further support finding an abuse of discretion that warrants mandamus 
relief. 
 
30. Moreover, the extraordinary circumstances present in this case—
including the fundamental parental rights at stake, the pattern of procedural 
obstacles Myers has encountered, and the difficulty in remedying an improper 
consolidation on appeal—demonstrate that Myers lacks an adequate appellate 
remedy. 
 
31. Granting the motion for rehearing would allow this Court to correct a 
clear misapplication of law and prevent continuous irreparable harm to Relator’s

parental rights before they are further compromised by proceedings tainted by 
procedural error. It would also serve the interests of judicial economy by 
preventing a trial based on an improper consolidation order that would likely 
necessitate reversal and retrial.

the court should issue a writ of mandamus directing Judge Newell to vacate the 
improper consolidation order. 
VIII. Prayer for Relief

Withdraw its prior denial of the petition for writ of mandamus; 
iii. 
Issue a writ of mandamus directing the Honorable Kenneth 
Newell, Judge of the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County, to 
vacate the consolidation order entered in violation of Tarrant 
County Local Rule 4.01(8)(a);

adequate remedy by appeal exists to cure the prejudice resulting
from these procedural violations;
