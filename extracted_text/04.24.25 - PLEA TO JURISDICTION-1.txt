NO. 322-744263-23 
IN THE 322nd DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
TO THE HONORABLE JAMES MUNFORD: 
The record reveals a pattern of the Court acting beyond its jurisdiction: on January 16, 
2024, the Court ousted Respondent from the marital residence without any finding of family 
violence or protective order; on March 26, 2024, the Court entered “Agreed” Temporary 
Orders without Respondent’s consent, flouting the statutory procedures for entry of such 
orders. These actions violate Respondent’s due process rights and the Texas Family Code. Under 
Texas law, orders issued without jurisdiction or in the absence of a party’s consent are void 
and cannot confer jurisdiction. Respondent asks the Court to recognize these fundamental defects 
and dismiss the current orders as a matter of law. 
Until these orders are resolved, or the court issues written findings regarding their 
legitimacy, Respondent will not appear and risk further deprivation of his rights from this court.

TO THE HONORABLE JAMES MUNFORD:

The record reveals a pattern of the Court acting beyond its jurisdiction: on January 16,
2024, the Court ousted Respondent from the marital residence without any finding of family
violence or protective order; on March 26, 2024, the Court entered “Agreed” Temporary
Orders without Respondent’s consent, flouting the statutory procedures for entry of such
orders. These actions violate Respondent’s due process rights and the Texas Family Code. Under
Texas law, orders issued without jurisdiction or in the absence of a party’s consent are void
and cannot confer jurisdiction. Respondent asks the Court to recognize these fundamental defects

and dismiss the current orders as a matter of law.

Until these orders are resolved, or the court issues written findings regarding their

legitimacy, Respondent will not appear and risk further deprivation of his rights from this court.

I. INTRODUCTION
Petitioner filed a divorce petition under Title 5 of the Texas Family Code on December 
18, 2023. That petition did not seek exclusive possession of the residence or ask that Respondent 
be excluded from the home. Shortly thereafter, on December 22, 2023, Petitioner filed a separate 
Application for Protective Order under Title 4 of the Family Code, in which she explicitly 
requested exclusive possession of the home, removal of Respondent, and child support. The 
Court consolidated the protective‐order case into the divorce case.  
On January 16, 2024, the court—without holding an evidentiary hearing or finding family 
violence—entered Temporary Orders granting Petitioner exclusive possession of the home and 
primary custody and child support, and requiring Respondent to vacate the residence that same 
day. No protective order was ever issued and no findings of family violence were made, even 
though Tex. Fam. Code §§ 83.006 and 85.001 plainly require such findings. In the weeks that 
followed, the court continued these arrangements and ultimately entered “Agreed” Temporary 
Orders (March 26, 2024) allocating parenting time and support. All of these extreme orders were 
based solely on Petitioner’s Title 4 application (and allegations of family violence), and no 
amendments to the pleadings were ever filed to convert the case into a Title 5 SAPCR. 
Respondent never received any notice or hearing on custody, possession, or support issues under 
Title 5. 
II. Legal Standards

only the claims and relief expressly pleaded by the parties, and must follow the Family Code’s

I. INTRODUCTION

Petitioner filed a divorce petition under Title 5 of the Texas Family Code on December
18, 2023. That petition did not seek exclusive possession of the residence or ask that Respondent
be excluded from the home. Shortly thereafter, on December 22, 2023, Petitioner filed a separate
Application for Protective Order under Title 4 of the Family Code, in which she explicitly
requested exclusive possession of the home, removal of Respondent, and child support. The

Court consolidated the protective-order case into the divorce case.

On January 16, 2024, the court—without holding an evidentiary hearing or finding family
violence—entered Temporary Orders granting Petitioner exclusive possession of the home and
primary custody and child support, and requiring Respondent to vacate the residence that same
day. No protective order was ever issued and no findings of family violence were made, even
though Tex. Fam. Code §§ 83.006 and 85.001 plainly require such findings. In the weeks that
followed, the court continued these arrangements and ultimately entered “Agreed” Temporary
Orders (March 26, 2024) allocating parenting time and support. All of these extreme orders were
based solely on Petitioner’s Title 4 application (and allegations of family violence), and no
amendments to the pleadings were ever filed to convert the case into a Title 5 SAPCR.
Respondent never received any notice or hearing on custody, possession, or support issues under

Title 5.

II. Legal Standards

The trial court’s authority is strictly limited by the statutes and pleadings. It may consider
only the claims and relief expressly pleaded by the parties, and must follow the Family Code’s

procedures for protective orders and SAPCRs. Subject-matter jurisdiction is a threshold issue: if

the court acted beyond the law, its orders are void. A plea to the jurisdiction is decided as a 
matter of law when the relevant facts are undisputed (see Tex. Dep’t of Parks & Wildlife v. 
Miranda, 133 S.W.3d 217, 228 (Tex. 2004)). Here, the material jurisdictional facts are not in 
dispute. 
III. Title 4 (Protective Order) Proceedings Cannot Support Custody or Support 
Under Texas law, a protective‐order proceeding (Title 4) is not a custody (SAPCR) 
proceeding (Title 5). The San Antonio Court of Appeals recently reaffirmed that without a proper 
SAPCR petition under Title 5, a court may not award conservatorship, possession, or support. In 
Rivera v. Figueroa (Tex. App.–San Antonio 2019), the court held that orders issued in a 
protective‐order case cannot support conservatorship or child‐support relief unless a Title 5 
petition was filed and noticed. Likewise, In re Sheffield, 639 S.W.2d 270 (Tex. App.–Dallas 
1982), long held that Title 4 and Title 5 proceedings are jurisdictionally separate: “a court may 
not grant relief beyond the scope of the protective‐order statute without compliance with the 
SAPCR statutes” (sheffield, 639 S.W.2d at 272-73). Here, Petitioner’s December 22 Title 4 
application was never amended or converted into a Title 5 petition. Respondent never waived 
notice or a hearing on conservatorship/possession issues. The court’s decision to exclude 
Respondent from the home and divest him of custody on January 16, 2024 therefore had no 
jurisdictional basis. In short, “[w]ithout a valid protective order in place, the court lacked 
jurisdiction to continue enforcing the extreme relief originally granted”. 
IV. Statutory Prerequisites for Exclusion and Protective Orders Were Not Met 
Even if the court treated the relief as a protective‐order, the Family Code’s strict 
requirements were ignored. Tex. Fam. Code § 83.006(a) permits exclusion of a party from the

the court acted beyond the law, its orders are void. A plea to the jurisdiction is decided as a
matter of law when the relevant facts are undisputed (see Tex. Dep t of Parks & Wildlife v.
Miranda, 133 S.W.3d 217, 228 (Tex. 2004)). Here, the material jurisdictional facts are not in

dispute.

III. Title 4 (Protective Order) Proceedings Cannot Support Custody or Support

Under Texas law, a protective-order proceeding (Title 4) is not a custody (SAPCR)
proceeding (Title 5). The San Antonio Court of Appeals recently reaffirmed that without a proper
SAPCR petition under Title 5, a court may not award conservatorship, possession, or support. In
Rivera v. Figueroa (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2019), the court held that orders issued in a
protective-order case cannot support conservatorship or child-support relief unless a Title 5
petition was filed and noticed. Likewise, In re Sheffield, 639 S.W.2d 270 (Tex. App.—Dallas
1982), long held that Title 4 and Title 5 proceedings are jurisdictionally separate: “a court may
not grant relief beyond the scope of the protective-order statute without compliance with the
SAPCR statutes” (sheffield, 639 S.W.2d at 272-73). Here, Petitioner’s December 22 Title 4
application was never amended or converted into a Title 5 petition. Respondent never waived
notice or a hearing on conservatorship/possession issues. The court’s decision to exclude
Respondent from the home and divest him of custody on January 16, 2024 therefore had no
jurisdictional basis. In short, “[w]ithout a valid protective order in place, the court lacked

jurisdiction to continue enforcing the extreme relief originally granted”.

IV. Statutory Prerequisites for Exclusion and Protective Orders Were Not Met

Even if the court treated the relief as a protective-order, the Family Code’s strict

requirements were ignored. Tex. Fam. Code § 83.006(a) permits exclusion of a party from the

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
home only if (1) the applicant files a sworn affidavit describing facts requiring exclusion, and (2) 
appears at the hearing to testify on those facts. Section 83.006(b) further requires that the court 
make three findings: (i) the applicant resides (or recently resided) at the premises, (ii) the other 
party committed family violence within the past 30 days, and (iii) there is a clear and present 
danger of future family violence. Likewise, § 85.001(a) mandates that at the close of a 
protective‐order hearing, the court must explicitly find whether family violence occurred. If so, 
the court “shall” issue a protective order against the perpetrator. In this case, none of these 
prerequisites were satisfied. Petitioner did file an application and affidavit, but no hearing on 
January 16 (or thereafter) produced any finding of family violence. The court did not issue a 
protective order as the statute requires, and instead simply extended the eviction and custody 
restrictions indefinitely. By failing to hold a hearing, make any family‐violence finding, or enter 
a protective order, the court “bypass[ed] the statutory prerequisites” entirely. Without those 
statutorily required findings, the January 16 “kick‐out” and custody order was outside the court’s 
power. 
V. All Orders Exceeding the Pleadings or Statutory Authority Are Void
It is a bedrock rule that a Texas court must confine its rulings to the relief requested by 
the pleadings and authorized by statute. Any order beyond that scope is void. The Houston First 
Court of Appeals has stated that “[a]n order purporting to grant relief beyond the pleadings is 
void ab initio”. In Guillory v. Boykins, 442 S.W.3d 682, 690 (Tex. App.–Houston [1st Dist.] 
2014, no pet.), the court held that where a trial court lacks jurisdiction or statutory authority to 
grant the relief, the order is void. Similarly, In re P.M.G., 405 S.W.3d 406, 416–17 (Tex. App.–
Texarkana 2013, no pet.), confirms that orders entered without pleadings or outside statutory 
scope are null. Here, not only did the protective‐order pleadings not include any SAPCR claims,

home only if (1) the applicant files a sworn affidavit describing facts requiring exclusion, and (2)
appears at the hearing to testify on those facts. Section 83.006(b) further requires that the court

a protective order, the court “bypass[ed] the statutory prerequisites” entirely. Without those
statutorily required findings, the January 16 “kick-out” and custody order was outside the court’s

power.

V. All Orders Exceeding the Pleadings or Statutory Authority Are Void

It is a bedrock rule that a Texas court must confine its rulings to the relief requested by
the pleadings and authorized by statute. Any order beyond that scope is void. The Houston First
Court of Appeals has stated that “[a]n order purporting to grant relief beyond the pleadings is
void ab initio”. In Guillory v. Boykins, 442 S.W.3d 682, 690 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist. ]
2014, no pet.), the court held that where a trial court lacks jurisdiction or statutory authority to
grant the relief, the order is void. Similarly, Jn re PM.G., 405 S.W.3d 406, 416-17 (Tex. App.—
Texarkana 2013, no pet.), confirms that orders entered without pleadings or outside statutory

scope are null. Here, not only did the protective-order pleadings not include any SAPCR claims,

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
but the later “agreed” orders on March 26, 2024 were not signed or even consented to by 
Respondent (violating Tex. R. Civ. P. 11). In short, every custody and exclusion order in this case 
was “predicated on a void order”. As the Second Court of Appeals recognized in In re C.L., 933 
S.W.2d 402, 405 (Tex. App.–Fort Worth 1996, no writ), an order that is void ab initio “cannot 
form the basis for any valid subsequent judgment”.  That’s exactly what is happening here. The 
court is now moving to finalize fraud, constitutional deprivation, and is trying to finalize its’ 
original excision of Respondent’s constitutional rights. The court cannot destroy a family and 
then move to finalize that without a lawful basis, and over orders that are fundamentally void. 
IV. Violation of Respondent’s Constitutional Rights to Due Process and Family Integrity 
The trial court’s actions not only violated statute but also trampled Respondent’s 
fundamental constitutional rights. By evicting the Respondent from his home and effectively 
separating him from his children with no prior notice or opportunity to be heard, the court 
deprived him of liberty and property without due process of law. This violates Article I, § 19 of 
the Texas Constitution (the “due course of law” guarantee) and the Fourteenth Amendment to 
the U.S. Constitution. Now, the court seeks to finalize this fundamental error amidst an ongoing 
appeal, showing a continuous and complete disregard for the Respondent’s rights.  
A. Deprivation of Property Without Due Process 
The January 16 order forced Respondent to vacate his own home on the same day it was 
issued. A person’s right to occupy their home is a significant property interest, protected by due 
process. Yet Respondent was ousted immediately, with no notice that such relief would be sought 
and no chance to contest the allegations. The Texas Constitution and the 14th Amendment both 
forbid the State from depriving any person of property without due process of law. Fuentes v. 
Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 81-82 (1972) (even temporary, non-final deprivations of property require

but the later “agreed” orders on March 26, 2024 were not signed or even consented to by
Respondent (violating Tex. R. Civ. P. 11). In short, every custody and exclusion order in this case
was “predicated on a void order”. As the Second Court of Appeals recognized in Jn re C.L., 933
S.W.2d 402, 405 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1996, no writ), an order that is void ab initio “cannot

court is now moving to finalize fraud, constitutional deprivation, and is trying to finalize its’
original excision of Respondent’s constitutional rights. The court cannot destroy a family and

then move to finalize that without a lawful basis, and over orders that are fundamentally void.

IV. Violation of Respondent’s Constitutional Rights to Due Process and Family Integrity

The trial court’s actions not only violated statute but also trampled Respondent’s
fundamental constitutional rights. By evicting the Respondent from his home and effectively
separating him from his children with no prior notice or opportunity to be heard, the court
deprived him of liberty and property without due process of law. This violates Article I, § 19 of
the Texas Constitution (the “due course of law” guarantee) and the Fourteenth Amendment to
the U.S. Constitution. Now, the court seeks to finalize this fundamental error amidst an ongoing

appeal, showing a continuous and complete disregard for the Respondent’s rights.
A. Deprivation of Property Without Due Process

The January 16 order forced Respondent to vacate his own home on the same day it was
issued. A person’s right to occupy their home is a significant property interest, protected by due
process. Yet Respondent was ousted immediately, with no notice that such relief would be sought
and no chance to contest the allegations. The Texas Constitution and the 14° Amendment both
forbid the State from depriving any person of property without due process of law. Fuentes v.

Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 81-82 (1972) (even temporary, non-final deprivations of property require

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
notice and hearing absent extraordinary circumstances). While Texas law does allow ex parte 
orders in truly exigent circumstances, those orders must be narrowly tailored and followed 
promptly by a full hearing. Here, the statutory requirements for an ex parte kick-out were 
disregarded, and Respondent was left homeless and separated from his belongings based on one-
sided assertions. This is precisely the kind of state action that due process is meant to guard 
against. 
B. Deprivation of Parental Rights Without Due Process 
Even more critically, the court’s orders infringed Respondent’s fundamental right to 
parent his children, also without due process. A parent’s interest in the care, custody, and control 
of their children is fundamental. The United States Supreme Court has recognized that “the 
interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children…is perhaps the oldest of the 
fundamental liberty interests recognized by this Court.” Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 
(2000) (plurality op.). Likewise, the Texas Supreme Court has affirmed that “the fundamental 
right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children” is 
constitutionally protected. In re C.J.C., 603 S.W.3d 804, 811 (Tex. 2020) (citing Troxel, 530 U.S. 
at 66). Governmental interference with this right is subject to strict scrutiny and must be 
accomplished only with rigorous procedural safeguards. 
Here, Respondent’s removal from the home effectively altered custody of the children 
without any hearing or finding of unfitness. Respondent went from being an equal managing 
conservator of the children to having zero possession or access (by virtue of being excluded from 
the home and the children’s presence) overnight and without notice. This is a profound 
deprivation of parental rights. As the U.S. Supreme Court held in Stanley v. Illinois, an unwed 
father could not be presumed unfit and have his children taken without a hearing – “the Due

parent his children, also without due process. A parent’s interest in the care, custody, and control
of their children is fundamental. The United States Supreme Court has recognized that “the
interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children...is perhaps the oldest of the
fundamental liberty interests recognized by this Court.” Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65

right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children” is
constitutionally protected. In re C.J.C., 603 S.W.3d 804, 811 (Tex. 2020) (citing Troxel, 530 US.
at 66). Governmental interference with this right is subject to strict scrutiny and must be

accomplished only with rigorous procedural safeguards.

without any hearing or finding of unfitness. Respondent went from being an equal managing
conservator of the children to having zero possession or access (by virtue of being excluded from
the home and the children’s presence) overnight and without notice. This is a profound
deprivation of parental rights. As the U.S. Supreme Court held in Stanley v. Illinois, an unwed

father could not be presumed unfit and have his children taken without a hearing — “the Due

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that [a father] be given a hearing on 
his fitness as a parent before his children are removed from his custody.” Stanley v. Illinois, 405 
U.S. 645, 649 (1972) (emphasis added). The State “cannot, consistently with due process, 
merely presume” a parent’s unfitness or danger and bypass a hearing; “parental unfitness 
must be established on the basis of individualized proof” before a child is taken away. Id. at 
647, 649. Yet in Respondent’s case, the court did exactly what Stanley forbids – it presumed the 
necessity of removing the father, without any adversarial testing of the evidence or finding of 
actual misconduct and left the determination for later (a hearing that kept getting postponed). 
This violated Respondent’s procedural due process rights to be heard before being deprived of 
custody of his children. 
Moreover, the substantive aspect of due process was violated. There is a “strong 
presumption that the best interest of a child is served by remaining with a fit parent.” Troxel, 
530 U.S. at 68-69. The government may not “infringe on the fundamental right of parents to 
make child rearing decisions simply because a state judge believes a ‘better decision’ could 
be made.” Id. at 72 (plurality op.). In the absence of any evidence or finding that Respondent 
was an unfit or dangerous parent, removing his children from him was an arbitrary infringement 
on his fundamental liberty interest. The orders entered in this case prioritized a one-sided 
allegation over a father’s constitutional rights, in a manner repugnant to both the Texas and U.S. 
Constitutions. Article I, Section 19 of the Texas Constitution guarantees that no citizen shall be 
deprived of liberty or property except by the due course of the law of the land – here, 
Respondent was deprived of both without the lawful procedures or any adjudication of 
wrongdoing.

In sum, the process (or lack thereof) employed by the court fell far short of constitutional 
requirements. This constitutional infirmity is independently sufficient to render the court’s orders 
void. A judgment entered in violation of due process is void and subject to collateral attack. 
Peralta v. Heights Medical Center, Inc., 485 U.S. 80, 84-85 (1988) (judgment rendered without 
proper notice violates due process and is void). The proper remedy for a void order that stems 
from a due process violation is to declare it a nullity and dismiss any action that cannot proceed 
without it. 
VI. Plea to the Jurisdiction Must Be Granted 
The undisputed record shows no factual or legal basis for the court’s jurisdiction over the 
extreme relief granted. Under Miranda v. Texas Dept. of Parks & Wildlife, a plea to the 
jurisdiction should be granted as a matter of law if the jurisdictional facts are undisputed or 
uncontroverted by competent evidence. Here, there is no genuine issue that (a) no protective 
order was issued and no findings of family violence were made, (b) no Title 5 SAPCR notice of 
hearing exists on the record, or was ever on file, and (c) all of Petitioner’s requests for home 
exclusion and support were styled under Title 4 and unsupported by any pleaded conservatorship 
claim. The court cannot “proceed further on the merits” without first resolving these fundamental 
defects. Because these jurisdictional defects are purely legal, a full evidentiary hearing is 
unnecessary – the Court should rule as a matter of law that it never had authority to enter any of 
the challenged orders, vacate them accordingly, and allow the status quo to reset. Additionally, 
the March 14, 2024, orders are a mere extension of the initial orders, which claim consent where 
consent is not present. These orders must be vacated as a matter of law as this court has no power 
to rule on void orders.

Respondent puts the court on notice that this plea serves as non-appearance notice in that 
he will not participate in any further proceedings until these issues are resolved in writing on the 
record, and will challenge any orders or decisions made prior to the resolution of these issues. 
VII. PRAYER 
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Charles Dustin Myers respectfully prays that the 
Court: 
1. Rule, as a matter of law, that the January 16, 2024, exclusion and custody order and all 
subsequent temporary orders are void ab initio for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction; 
2. Vacate and rescind those orders, and dismiss with prejudice any custody, possession, or 
support claims that rest on them; alternatively, dismiss all SAPCR claims for want of 
proper pleadings, notice, and jurisdiction; 
3. Issue a written ruling on this plea as required by law, and stay all further proceedings in 
this case pending resolution of this jurisdictional challenge; and 
4. Grant such other and further relief, at law or in equity, to which Respondent may be justly 
entitled. 
Respectfully submitted,

Respondent puts the court on notice that this plea serves as non-appearance notice in that
he will not participate in any further proceedings until these issues are resolved in writing on the

record, and will challenge any orders or decisions made prior to the resolution of these issues.
VIL. PRAYER

WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Charles Dustin Myers respectfully prays that the

Court:

1. Rule, as a matter of law, that the January 16, 2024, exclusion and custody order and all

subsequent temporary orders are void ab initio for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction;

2. Vacate and rescind those orders, and dismiss with prejudice any custody, possession, or
support claims that rest on them; alternatively, dismiss all SAPCR claims for want of

proper pleadings, notice, and jurisdiction;

3. Issue a written ruling on this plea as required by law, and stay all further proceedings in

this case pending resolution of this jurisdictional challenge; and

4. Grant such other and further relief, at law or in equity, to which Respondent may be justly

entitled.
Respectfully submitted,

/s/ Charles Dustin Myers
