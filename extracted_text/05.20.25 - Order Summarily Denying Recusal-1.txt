IN THE DISTRICT COURT 
TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
322nd JUDICIAL DISTRICT 
ORDER SUMMARILY DENYING MOTION FOR RECUSAL 
Before me is an Order of Referral from the Honorable James B. Munford signed April 29, 
2025, referring a Motion to Recuse and First Amended Motion to Recuse filed by Charles Dustin 
Myers in the above-referenced matter. 
After reviewing the motion and amended motion, I find that the motion and amended 
motion are based solely on the judge's rulings in the case under Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a (a) (3), and, 
even assuming they are not, the motions fail to state with detail and particularity facts that are 
within the affiant's personal knowledge, or on information and belief, that would be admissible in 
evidence and that, if proven, would be sufficient to justify recusal of Judge Munford on any ground 
specified in Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b (b), as required by Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a (a)(4). 
THEREFORE, having concluded that the motion and amended motion seeking to recuse 
Judge Munford fail to comply with Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a (a), I summarily deny the motions in this 
matter, without a hearing, pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. 
SIGNED this 19th day of May, 2025.

THEREFORE, having concluded that the motion and amended motion seeking to recuse
