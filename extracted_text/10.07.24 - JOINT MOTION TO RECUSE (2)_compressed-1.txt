MOTION FOR RECUSAL 
 
 
TO THE HONORABLE DAVID EVANS 
OF THE 8TH ADMINISTRATIVE JUDICIAL REGION OF TEXAS: 
In February of 2018, response to a question posed by the Republican Club Political 
Action Committee, the now elected District Judge James Munford stated:  
“I’m running for this office because I’ve worked many, many years in the family law field. I want 
to help and work with the citizens of Tarrant County and the families of Tarrant County to 
provide a good and accurate judiciary that follows the rules of law.” 
 
However, in this case, Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, has encountered a 
series of judicial determinations that fundamentally contradict this objective. The 
assurance to uphold a judiciary that follows the rule of law has been replaced with 
decisions that have deprived the Respondent of due process, equitable hearings, and his 
fundamental paternal rights.  Respondent respectfully moves to recuse District Judge 
James Munford and Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer pursuant to TAC §155.152 & TEX. 
R. CIV. P § 18b(b)(1) and in support thereof , states the following un-opposed facts:

MYERS AND CAROLINE MYERS,

CHILDREN

TO THE HONORABLE DAVID EVANS

OF THE 8TH ADMINISTRATIVE JUDICIAL REGION OF TEXAS:

In February of 2018, response to a question posed by the Republican Club Political
Action Committee, the now elected District Judge James Munford stated:

“T’m running for this office because I’ve worked many, many years in the family law field. I want

to help and work with the citizens of Tarrant County and the families of Tarrant County to

provide a good and accurate judiciary that follows the rules of law.”
However, in this case, Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, has encountered a
series of judicial determinations that fundamentally contradict this objective. The
assurance to uphold a judiciary that follows the rule of law has been replaced with
decisions that have deprived the Respondent of due process, equitable hearings, and his
fundamental paternal rights. Respondent respectfully moves to recuse District Judge

James Munford and Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer pursuant to TAC §155.152 & TEX.

R. CIV. P § 18b(b)(1) and in support thereof , states the following un-opposed facts:

I. BASIS FOR RECUSAL 
A. The impartiality of a judge may be challenged in the trial court by a motion to 
recuse. TEX. R. CIV. P. 18a, 18b. The Respondent respectfully moves to recuse Honorable 
Judge James Munford and Honorable Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer from presiding over 
cause number 322-744263-231 for their  collective  inability to remain impartial in this 
matter by depriving the Respondent of a fair trial on four separate appearances. “Texas 
requires the recusal of a judge in any case where his or her impartiality might reasonably 
be questioned, regardless of any actual bias which may be held in a case.” Aguilar v. 
Anderson., 855 S.W.2d 799, 815. 
B. This motion has been filed at the earliest practicable opportunity, as the 
Respondent has exhausted all other available legal avenues without receiving any response, 
explanation, or opposition. Respondent has given the trial court every opportunity to 
correct the errors made in this case and has recently discovered pertinent information 
related to the initial proceeding that took place on January 16th, 2024, as outlined below. 
There are no current settings or upcoming hearings, and the case has not yet been scheduled 
for a final trial. The Respondent’s motion is verified and asserts grounds for recusal 
pursuant to TEX. CIV. R. P. 18(b)b1. These grounds are not predicated solely on the judges’ 
prior rulings. Instead, this motion presents detailed, particularized facts based on the 
Respondent's direct knowledge that are admissible as evidence and are self-authenticating

Moreover, where facts are presented based on information and belief, the foundation for 
such beliefs is explicitly stated. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 18a(a)(1)-(4); 18a(b)(1) 
II. QUESTIONING THE IMPARTIALITY OF JAMES MUNFORD 
 
A. On September 29th, 2024, the Respondent discovered a Facebook post made by 
the Tarrant County District Courts which stated the following:  
“The following Tarrant County District Courts will be closed tomorrow, Tuesday, January 16, 
2024. 
This list is evolving as individual Judges are making informed decisions based on their dockets, 
inclement weather, and the safety and welfare of litigants, Court staff, counsel, and the general 
public.” – Tarrant County District Courts on January 15, 2024. 
 
 
The Fort Worth Independent School District also announced that they would remain 
closed due to inclement weather in the area. https://www.fox4news.com/news/dallas-fort-
worth-school-closings-jan-16. On December 14th, 2024, the petitioner requested a 
protective order from James Munford, which was denied. Exhibit A. However, one month 
and two days later, Judge James Munford made an initial decision that has been 
unexplained for the last ten months. 
B. The initial decision at issue arose during a show cause hearing concerning an 
order of protection initiated by the petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, on December 22, 
2023. This hearing was originally scheduled to be presided over by Associate Judge 
Jeffrey Kaitcer in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County at 9:00 A.M. on January 16th, 
2024. However, due to delays caused by inclement weather as mentioned above, the

Il. QUESTIONING THE IMPARTIALITY OF JAMES MUNFORD

A. On September 29th, 2024, the Respondent discovered a Facebook post made by
the Tarrant County District Courts which stated the following:

“The following Tarrant County District Courts will be closed tomorrow, Tuesday, January 16,
2024.

This list is evolving as individual Judges are making informed decisions based on their dockets,
inclement weather, and the safety and welfare of litigants, Court staff, counsel, and the general

public.” — Tarrant County District Courts on January 15, 2024.

The Fort Worth Independent School District also announced that they would remain
closed due to inclement weather in the area. /ttps://Awww.fox4news.com/news/dallas-fort-
worth-school-closings-jan-16. On December 14", 2024, the petitioner requested a
protective order from James Munford, which was denied. Exhibit A. However, one month
and two days later, Judge James Munford made an initial decision that has been
unexplained for the last ten months.

B. The initial decision at issue arose during a show cause hearing concerning an
order of protection initiated by the petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, on December 22,
2023. This hearing was originally scheduled to be presided over by Associate Judge
Jeffrey Kaitcer in the 322" District Court of Tarrant County at 9:00 A.M. on January 16",

2024. However, due to delays caused by inclement weather as mentioned above, the

proceedings were instead conducted by District Judge James Munford, as Associate 
Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer arrived late. 
C. Both parties were present and appeared without legal representation. During the
proceedings, Judge Munford presented the parties with an agreed continuance, which 
both parties accepted, and which was subsequently granted by Judge Munford as 
reflected in his order. However, despite granting the continuance, Judge Munford went 
further, issuing a series of rulings where he sua sponte consolidated the protective order 
case with the divorce case previously filed by the petitioner on December 18, 2023. 
Exhibit B. He ordered the Respondent to vacate the residency that same day by 2:00 p.m., 
divested him of the custody of his children, and the hearing was then rescheduled for 
January 22, 2024, to be presided over by Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer. Exhibit C. 
D. This decision by Judge Munford undeniably raises serious questions regarding
his impartiality in this matter. Due process of law requires that an individual receive 
notice and hearing before being deprived of a property right. In re the Guardianship of 
Bays, 355 S.W.3d 715, 720 (Tex. App. 2011); See Grannis v. Ordean, 234 U.S. 385, 394, 
34 S. Ct. 779, 783, 58 L. Ed. 1363 (1914) ("a fundamental requisite of due process of law 
is the opportunity to be heard"). Furthermore, the Texas Family Code prohibits such an 
order before notice and hearing. TEX. FAM. CODE 105.001 (“…an order may not be 
rendered under Subsection (a)(1)… except after notice and a hearing…”) (referencing 
child custody).

E. Moreover, 6.405(b) of the Texas Family Code was not satisfied, which is a 
mandatory requirement before any hearing can take place given the original petition for 
divorce claimed an active order of protection was currently in effect against the 
Respondent. Exhibit B, p. 7. (“The petitioner shall attach to the petition a copy of each 
order described by Subsection (a)(1) in which a party to the suit or the child of a party to 
the suit was the applicant or victim of the conduct alleged in the application… if a copy 
of the order is not available at the time of filing, the petition must state that a copy of the 
order will be filed with the court before any hearing.) All of the procedural safeguards 
above were disregarded by James Munford. 
F. The purpose of temporary orders with injunctive relief is not to destroy the 
status quo, but rather to preserve it. See Iranian Muslim Organization v. City of San 
Antonio, 615 S.W.2d 202, 208 (Tex. 1981); Davis v. Huey, 571 S.W.2d 859, 862 (Tex. 
1978); Citizens of Texas Sav. v. Fox Jacobs, 718 S.W.2d 2, 3 (Tex. App. 1985). Similarly 
to how the temporary injunction in Coyote Lake Ranch, LLC v. City of Lubbock, 498 
S.W.3d 53 (Tex. 2016) improperly denied the City its undisputed right to access 
groundwater—an essential resource—Judge Munford's rulings have deprived the 
Respondent of his residency, which has served not only as the family home since 2015 
but also as the headquarters for his business which provided for the children – an 
essential resource to their wellbeing. Furthermore, the Respondent was divested of 
custodial rights to his children without justification. Like the injunction in Coyote, rather 
than preserving the status quo, these initial rulings have done the opposite by depriving

the Respondent of his constitutional rights to property prior to due process of law. US 
CONST. AMEND XIV, § 1; TEX CONST. ART. I, § 19. Furthermore, James Munford 
prejudged critical matters that require full evidentiary hearings. TEX. FAM. CODE 
105.001(b) (…an order may not be rendered under Subsection (a)(1), (2), or (5) except 
after notice and a hearing.) (in regard to the temporary conservatorship for a child, for the 
temporary support of the child, or for payment of attorney’s fees.)  
G. The Respondent’s burden of showing of bias or impartiality to such an extent 
that the movant was deprived of a fair trial is satisfied from Judge Munford’s initial 
ruling. See Rodriguez v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., No. 04-14-00342-CV, 22 (Tex. 
App. Jun. 17, 2015).  
H. The threshold for recusal is "whether a reasonable member of the public at 
large, knowing all the facts in the public domain concerning the judge's conduct, would 
have a reasonable doubt that the judge is actually impartial." Hansen v. JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A., 346 S.W.3d 769, 776 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2011, no pet.); Rodriguez v. 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., No. 04-14-00342-CV, 22 (Tex. App. Jun. 17, 2015). The 
Respondent asserts that a reasonable member of the public would indeed reasonably 
doubt James Munford was actually impartial given that he deprived the Respondent of a 
fair trial. Thus, the Respondent’s burden and threshold for recusal has been met, and 
Judge James Munford should be recused from this matter.

opinion regarding the Respondent living next door to his ex-partner’s grandparents,

I. The only reasoning provided was an oral statement regarding his personal

opinion regarding the Respondent living next door to his ex-partner’s grandparents,

which is extrajudicial and comes from a biased perspective which discounted the facts of 
the case relevant to the children’s well-being. In the context of this case, recusal is 
warranted if the trial judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned, or he has a 
personal bias. TEX. R. CIV. P. 18b(2). This opinion or bias was irrelevant to the well 
being of the children, as the grandmother, much like the children, relied on the 
Respondent’s income in order to provide financial stability, and further justifies his 
recusal.  
III. QUESTIONING THE IMPARTIALITY OF JEFFREY KAITCER 
A. The initial ruling reset the case to January 22nd, 2024. The Respondent retained 
the services of Dan Bacalis, while the Petitioner arrived without any legal representation 
and retained the services of Cooper Carter in the lobby of the courtroom. Much like the 
first setting, Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer granted a continuance which only benefitted 
the petitioner by allowing her legal representation more time to become familiar with the 
case while simultaneously extending the initial orders of Judge James Munford to 
February 1st, 2024, which significantly impacted the Respondent and his children. Exhibit 
D. Neither party appeared before the Jeffrey Kaitcer, and this decision was made without 
any input from the Respondent and without any opportunity to contest it.  
B. At the third trial setting on February 1, 2024, the parties arrived only to be 
presented with a settlement agreement from the Respondent’s own counsel. Given that 
the case had been delayed twice already and the ongoing damage from being unable to

which is extrajudicial and comes from a biased perspective which discounted the facts of
the case relevant to the children’s well-being. In the context of this case, recusal is
warranted if the trial judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned, or he has a
personal bias. TEX. R. CIV. P. 18b(2). This opinion or bias was irrelevant to the well
being of the children, as the grandmother, much like the children, relied on the
Respondent’s income in order to provide financial stability, and further justifies his

recusal.
IH. QUESTIONING THE IMPARTIALITY OF JEFFREY KAITCER

A. The initial ruling reset the case to January 22"4, 2024. The Respondent retained
the services of Dan Bacalis, while the Petitioner arrived without any legal representation
and retained the services of Cooper Carter in the lobby of the courtroom. Much like the
first setting, Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer granted a continuance which only benefitted
the petitioner by allowing her legal representation more time to become familiar with the
case while simultaneously extending the initial orders of Judge James Munford to
February 1*', 2024, which significantly impacted the Respondent and his children. Exhibit
D. Neither party appeared before the Jeffrey Kaitcer, and this decision was made without

any input from the Respondent and without any opportunity to contest it.

B. At the third trial setting on February 1, 2024, the parties arrived only to be
presented with a settlement agreement from the Respondent’s own counsel. Given that
the case had been delayed twice already and the ongoing damage from being unable to
work at full capacity was compounding by the day, the Respondent contested this

strategy. He was informed by his attorney that the orders could be modified later and was 
urged to sign it. Left with no better alternative, the Respondent signed the agreement 
under duress after already being deprived of his residency, children, and business since 
January 16th, 2024. Exhibit E 
C. The agreement removed the children from their own home that they had resided 
in their entire life and allowed the Respondent back into the home until March 1, 2024. It 
also established child support, and allocated financial responsibilities to the parties, to 
where the Respondent was left with both car payments, an unreasonable amount of time 
to transition from the home and with the addition of child support obligations. Exhibit E 
D. Due to the Respondent’s counsel drafting a settlement agreement rather than 
representing the interests of his client, he was terminated shortly after the third setting on 
February 5, 2024, where the Respondent began to represent himself  pro se. Exhibit F. He 
filed a motion to reconsider the associate judge’s report for temporary orders on February 
9, 2024, which wasn’t set for hearing until March 14 due to unnecessary delay by the 
opposing counsel, Cooper Carter, who has not filed any pleadings in this case on behalf 
of the petitioner. Exhibit G 
E. Given that Dan Bacalis had been terminated, and that the associate judge’s 
report signed on February 1, 2024, had clear stipulations regarding its’ reduction to 
writing Exhibit G, p.5, the Respondent filed notice with the court on March 4th, 2024, 
stating that he would not be leaving the marital residence as it was not in the best 
interests of his children. Exhibit H

F. This decision prompted the petitioner to run inside the family residence on 
March 6th, 2024, while the Respondent was walking his daughters to school on her 
visitation time and lock the petitioner out of the home. Since this day, the Respondent has 
pursued relief to no avail, without argument, and without any response or findings of 
facts from either judge or Cooper Carter, petitioner’s counsel. 
G. On March 14, 2024, the parties appeared before Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer 
to address the Respondent's motion to reconsider. Just minutes prior to the hearing, the 
Respondent was served formally reduced temporary orders by Cooper L. Carter, which 
contained significant clerical discrepancies and deviated from the original orders signed 
on February 1, 2024. These orders are currently in effect today as ‘agreed orders’. Exhibit 
I. The orders also reference a hearing that was never conducted in this case. 
H. During the hearing, the Respondent was precluded from addressing the events 
leading up to February 1, 2024, due to sustained objections based on relevance. Despite 
signing off on the Associate Judge’s Report which non-suited the protective order, the 
opposing counsel was nonetheless permitted to elicit testimony from their client 
regarding her purported fear for safety should Respondent be allowed near the residency, 
which has not been supported by any evidence to date.   
I. Judge Kaitcer refused to admit the Respondent's exhibits, which included 
affidavits from business clients prepared to attest to his need for residency and his close 
relationship with his daughters. Exhibit J. Judge Kaitcer further stated in open court,

You just care about your business." This remark, devoid of any evidentiary basis, exposed 
a deep-seated bias that rendered impartial adjudication impossible. A neutral and 
impartial evaluator would have acknowledged the interconnected nature of the 
Respondent's business, residency, and familial relationships as well as the impact of the 
initial proceedings leading up to that point. Further, an impartial judge would have 
realized that there is no logical explanation to remove a parent who relies on the 
residency to provide for the children while simultaneously denying the evidence that 
would have corroborated this need.

requiring him to sign the temporary orders served just moments earlier by 1:30 p.m. that

Respondent's signature, was reduced outside of its’ own procedural requirements ordered

Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer remain unexplained, and the damage is ongoing. Their 
joint recusal is necessary to ensure a fair resolution of this matter and to ensure the 
persistent favoritism directed towards the petitioner is abolished.

participation from the opposing party, and all attempted communications have failed.  
There hasn’t been any explanation for the denials in the Second Court of Appeals, leaving 
the Respondent to continue seeking every remedy available to him to correct the 
decisions presented above or receive a valid legal basis that justifies them.  
 
B. The joint managing conservatorship that the current orders outline has put the 
Respondent in massive amounts of debt. He had to stay in hotels on Thursday nights in 
order to take his Children to school on Friday mornings for his visitation period, and for 
the extended summer visitation, rented an AIR BNB in order to provide the Children with 
a stable living space. The Respondent was able to have the owner of the AIRBNB located 
at 6608 Dewsbury St. that was only 1.3 miles from the Respondent’s home allow him to 
port forward the router, allowing him to work to some degree, where he stayed until 
September 14th, 2024. Given the requirements to operate his business, an alternative 
residency would take a fair amount of time to transition to, and likewise the petitioner 
would need equal amount of time to obtain full employment in order to maintain the

before the court on January 16th, 2024, but were not considered. Exhibit L, Exhibit M 
 
C. Since the March 14th hearing, the petitioner has moved additional family 
members into the home, has not paid rent, and has reduced her employment while 
significantly reducing the Respondents. On top of both James Munford and Jeffrey 
Kaitcer’s disregard for the law and the best interests of the children, the inadvertent

expense of the status quo of the children. An impartial judge is required in this matter to 
ensure that this one-sided favoritism does not continue at the expense of the children. 
 
 D. On June 2 of 2024, the petitioner’s grandmother  contacted the Respondent 
reiterating the above. She stated that the children were not being taken care of, that the 
petitioner was not acting like herself, and that she was not paying rent. This information 
was relayed to the Supreme Court of Texas, where the Respondent’s motion for rehearing 
on petition for writ of mandamus is still pending before the court, asking them to compel 
James Munford to vacate the current orders which were entered by Associate Judge 
Jeffrey Kaitcer as agreed without consent and referenced a hearing that has never taken

1. What dire circumstance compelled Judge James Munford to take up a case on

knowing the facts or considering the pleadings, particularly on a day the court was 
closed due to inclement weather when he had denied a similar request a month 
earlier?

VI. CONCLUSION 
This case, as detailed in the pending motion for rehearing before the Supreme 
Court of Texas, revolves around the core issue of accountability. What began with 
Morgan Michelle Myers attempting to avoid responsibility has now evolved into a 
troubling scenario where both judges have repeatedly failed to recognize and correct their 
serious missteps. Attorney Cooper Carter’s authority to represent the petitioner, currently 
being challenged through a Rule 12 motion, further deepens concerns about the integrity 
and fairness of these proceedings. 
Recusing both judges is not just a procedural necessity, but a crucial step toward 
ensuring that this case is reviewed impartially and that the facts are properly considered. 
This will allow the court to focus on the petitioner’s pattern of deception and, more 
importantly, what truly serves the best interests of the children. The petitioner’s actions 
have caused unnecessary delays, destabilized her family, and inflicted significant 
emotional and financial harm on all involved. The ongoing litigation, exacerbated by a 
lack of judicial transparency and accountability, has only added to the hardship. 
Despite these issues, the Respondent holds no ill will toward any party involved. 
His primary concern has always been, and continues to be, doing what is right for his 
children. The Respondent believes that with impartial judges and a renewed focus on 
fairness, this case can still be resolved justly, allowing all parties to move forward with 
dignity and integrity. The Respondent remains diligent in his commitment to securing a 
fair outcome that reflects the best interests of his children as the Family Code mandates.

3. I am submitting this affidavit in support of my Joint Motion for Recusal of District
Judge James Munford and Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer in the above-referenced
case due to their demonstrated inability to remain impartial and provide me a fair
trial.

4. As outlined in the Joint Motion for Recusal, I have encountered judicial
determinations in this case that have deprived me of due process, equitable
hearings, and my fundamental parental rights. The decisions rendered by both
Judge Munford and Judge Kaitcer have caused significant harm to my ability to

maintain stability for my children and have compounded my financial hardship.

5. I have attempted to address these concerns through all available legal avenues, yet 
I have received no adequate response or resolution. The continued judicial 
favoritism towards the petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, has resulted in undue 
hardship on me and my children, destabilizing our lives both emotionally and 
financially. 
6. I attest that all facts presented in the Joint Motion for Recusal are true and accurate 
based on my personal experience and knowledge. I have made every effort to act 
in the best interests of my children throughout these proceedings, and I believe 
that the recusal of both judges is necessary for an impartial review of this case. 
7. I further attest that the petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, has knowingly made 
false statements and misrepresented facts in order to benefit herself in these 
proceedings, which has inadvertently caused harm to our children. These false 
statements have contributed to the current instability and emotional distress they 
are experiencing. I affirm that all statements made herein regarding the welfare of 
the children are true, accurate, and made under penalty of perjury. 
8. I also affirm that my return to the family residence will be conducted with 
amicable honor and respect for all involved. I will take every step necessary to 
ensure a peaceful and respectful environment, with no conflict or disruptions. 
While residing in the home temporarily, I will pursue alternative living 
arrangements, allowing for a smooth transition, all while preserving the status quo 
for the sake of the children and their well-being.

Petitioner,

Emergency Motion to Reconsider
Evidence and to Vacate Temporary
Orders

Charles Dustin Myers,

Respondent

This motion urgently calls for the Court's intervention to address critical procedural
missteps in the matter of cause# 322-744263-23, aiming to reinstate the safety and stability
that our children rightfully deserve until due process and all facts of the case can be considered
by the Court. I am seeking immediate court intervention to correct procedural errors and
address the misuse of the legal system by the Petitioner. This motion highlights the significant
impact of the Petitioner's actions on our children's welfare and my unjust removal from our
home based on frivolous claims.

In pursuit of justice and the well-being of the children at heart, I respectfully request that
the Court reconsider all details, weighing the comprehensive scenario presented herein along
with the supporting evidence. I am committed to the highest interests of my children and
family, striving to resolve these matters efficiently and avoid unnecessary judicial expenditure.
This document seeks to unveil the Petitioner’s deliberate misrepresentation and misuse of the
legal system, which has gravely disrupted our children's stability and emotional well-being by
weaponizing the court system.

1 On December 1st, 2023, the Petitioner announced her desire for a divorce with no plan in place to preserve our
familial stability, with no desire for counseling or communication, and with no consideration of the timing around
the holiday season, nor any sign of marital discord warranting such a decision leading up to this announcement.

2 Between December 14th, 2023, and December 22nd, 2023, the Petitioner filed for an Emergency Protective
Order, a Divorce Petition, a Protective Order, and instigated an Eviction suit.

NATURE OF SUITS AND THIRD-PARTY INFLUENCE 
1. On December 1st, 2023, Petitioner announced the divorce with no plan in place for the 
children, no sign of marital discord leading up to this point to warrant such a decision, 
and no desire for counseling, communication, and no consideration for the time of year.  
 
2. Between December 1st, 2023, and December 12th, 2023, all efforts are exhausted in an 
attempt to communicate with the Petitioner which lead to the subsequent discovery of an 
alarming volume of text messages that were directed towards two individuals – Debbie 
Price and Damen Kazlauskas, showing a significant level of influence.³ 
 
 
3. On December 12th, 2023, After the discovery of the communications between these two 
individuals combined with the irrational behavior from the Petitioner during such a 
critical time of year, I reached out to the Petitioner’s grandfather via text message.⁴ 
 
4. On December 13th, 2023, Petitioner states she will be going to talk to her Grandparents 
alone. This conversation lasts between 9:55 and 1:30 A.M. 
 
 
5. On December 14th, 2023, Petitioner filed for an Emergency Protective Order. This order 
was denied by the court.  
 
6. On December 15th, 2023, Petitioner involves her family into the situation.       
Particularly, Dan Branthoover became involved. He is the boyfriend of the Petitioner’s 
Mother. Shortly thereafter, I received a notice from our joint bank account stating that 
$1,576 had just been withdrawn. As our bank statement for December 2023 will 
demonstrate – the transaction record shows the funds being transferred directly to Mr. 
Branthoover’s PayPal account.⁵

FRIVOLOUS CLAIMS AND FALSE STATEMENTS 
A. EMERGENCY PROTECTIVE ORDER 
1. As mentioned above, Petitioner filed for an Emergency Protective Order on 
December 14th, 2023. This protective order was denied by the courts. 
2. Due to the fact this order was not granted by the court, one could conclude that 
there was not a clear and present danger of family violence.¹ 
B. THE DIVORCE PETITION 
1. Petition was filed on 2024-12-18 under an Affidavit of Inability to pay.² 
2. The Petitioner's action of filing for divorce under an Affidavit of Inability to pay 
three days after transferring $1,576 to herself starkly contravenes the mandates 
set forth in Chapter 10, Section 10.001 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code. This 
section asserts that each claim or legal contention must be warranted by existing 
law or a nonfrivolous argument for the modification of existing law or the 
establishment of new law, and that each factual contention has or is likely to have 
evidentiary support after further investigation or discovery³.  
3. The Petitioner violated Chapter 10, Section 10.001 a second time within the 
same document when she intentionally elected to waive the 60-day waiting 
period claiming to have an active protective order against me that found family 
violence had occurred during our marriage⁴ despite being denied such an order 
just five days prior on December 14th, 2023.  
5. The final page of the Divorce Petition for service to the Office of the Attorney 
General was left unsigned by the Petitioner. 
 
 
 
¹ TEXAS FAMILY CODE, TITLE 4, SUBTITLE B, CHAPTER 83, Sec. 83.001 
² See attached EXHIBIT B.1 – A True and Accurate copy of the Divorce Petition for all references made in regard to 
this document. 
³ CIVIL PRACTICE AND REMEDIES CODE, TITLE 2, SUBTITLE A, CHAPTER 10, Sec. 10.001. 
⁴ TEXAS FAMILY CODE, Sec. 6.405 – The petitioner shall attach to the petition a copy of each order described by 
Subsection (a)(1). No such order, as required, was attached to the divorce petition, because no such order exists.

FRIVOLOUS CLAIMS AND FALSE STATEMENTS
A. EMERGENCY PROTECTIVE ORDER

1. As mentioned above, Petitioner filed for an Emergency Protective Order on
December 14", 2023. This protective order was denied by the courts.

2. Due to the fact this order was not granted by the court, one could conclude that
there was not a clear and present danger of family violence.!

B. THE DIVORCE PETITION
1. Petition was filed on 2024-12-18 under an Affidavit of Inability to pay.?

2. The Petitioner's action of filing for divorce under an Affidavit of Inability to pay
three days after transferring $1,576 to herself starkly contravenes the mandates
set forth in Chapter 10, Section 10.001 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code. This
section asserts that each claim or legal contention must be warranted by existing
law or a nonfrivolous argument for the modification of existing law or the
establishment of new law, and that each factual contention has or is likely to have
evidentiary support after further investigation or discovery?.

3. The Petitioner violated Chapter 10, Section 10.001 a second time within the
same document when she intentionally elected to waive the 60-day waiting
period claiming to have an active protective order against me that found family
violence had occurred during our marriage* despite being denied such an order
just five days prior on December 14", 2023.

5. The final page of the Divorce Petition for service to the Office of the Attorney
General was left unsigned by the Petitioner.

1 TEXAS FAMILY CODE, TITLE 4, SUBTITLE B, CHAPTER 83, Sec. 83.001

2 See attached EXHIBIT B.1 — A True and Accurate copy of the Divorce Petition for all references made in regard to

this document.
3 CIVIL PRACTICE AND REMEDIES CODE, TITLE 2, SUBTITLE A, CHAPTER 10, Sec. 10.001.

+ TEXAS FAMILY CODE, Sec. 6.405 — The petitioner shall attach to the petition a copy of each order described by
Subsection (a)(1). No such order, as required, was attached to the divorce petition, because no such order exists.

C. EVICTION SUIT 
1. The suit was unlawful by nature⁵, as the grounds for eviction were based on 
family status, referencing the divorce as well as a protective order that had been 
denied on December 14th, 2023. The suit was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction on 
January 17th, 2024.⁶ 
 
D. PROTECTIVE ORDER 
1. This suit was the second attempt by the Petitioner to have me removed from 
the home, which ultimately succeeded.  
2. The claims within this suit mentioned sexually aggressive comments and 
threatening behavior. These allegations are materially false, as the Petitioner 
possesses no evidence, and has presented no evidence in relation to these claims 
since the initiation of the suit. Despite this, as video and image evidence will show 
once a fair trial date is set, the Petitioner and I continued to maintain stability at 
our family home and preserved the sense of normalcy that our daughters have 
been accustomed to their entire lives up until January 16th, 2024. 
 
The Court's decision to remove me from my home and my children’s lives on January 
16th, 2024, albeit preliminary and unjustified, bypassed the safeguarding of the children's 
emotional, psychological, and physical well-being. This oversight is compounded by the 
Petitioner's actions. The juxtaposition of the Court's decision against the backdrop of the 
Petitioner's inattention to the children's needs illuminates a disconcerting disregard for the 
paramount principle that custody determinations should primarily serve the children's best 
interests. The final section of this motion will highlight the procedural aspects of the events 
unfolding between the dates of January 16th, 2024, and February 1st, 2024, and pray the court 
will rectify this situation by restoring the stability to our family by vacating the current 
temporary orders that are in place until a proper investigation can be completed by the courts.

THE PROTECTIVE ORDER HEARINGS 
1. In preparation for the Protective Order hearing on January 16th, 2024, I filed with the 
Court an answer to the Protective Order on January 2nd, 2024 as well as two motions – a 
motion to consolidate the divorce with the protective order, filed on January 4th, 2024, as 
well as a motion of continuance, filed on January 8th, 2024 for the purpose to acquire 
counsel due to the complex nature of the case.¹ All three filings were accepted by the 
court.  
 
2. On January 16th, 2024, both parties sought additional time to secure legal 
representation. Despite not reviewing any evidence, witness testimonies, or documents 
related to the motions, and acknowledging the denial of a previous Emergency Protective 
Order, the court mandated my departure from our home within four hours. This 
decision, unexpectedly made, awarded custody to the Petitioner, overlooking my 
concerns about the adverse effects on our children and my work from home. This ruling, 
which both parties did not sign, set the case to resume on January 22nd, 2024, to allow 
time for obtaining counsel.² 
 
3. Following the court's directive, I relocated to my father's residence in Flower Mound until 
the subsequent hearing. During this interval, the Petitioner did not take the initiative to 
have the children call once and did not provide any information as to how they were 
doing, showcasing her lack of empathy and concern for our children’s well-being and 
stability. After incurring substantial expenses to secure representation, I detailed my case 
and concerns to my attorney, preparing for the next court appearance. 
 
4. On January 22nd, 2024, the Petitioner chose to seek legal representation just minutes 
before the hearing was due to start, indicating a disregard for the process. My lawyer 
recommended agreeing to a continuance, thereby extending the period I couldn't work 
and impacting our established family dynamics. This resulted in a third hearing being set 
for February 1st, coinciding with my birthday, and a second rendition being ordered.³

THE PROTECTIVE ORDER HEARINGS

1.

In preparation for the Protective Order hearing on January 16", 2024, I filed with the
Court an answer to the Protective Order on January 24, 2024 as well as two motions — a
motion to consolidate the divorce with the protective order, filed on January 4", 2024, as
well as a motion of continuance, filed on January 8", 2024 for the purpose to acquire
counsel due to the complex nature of the case.! All three filings were accepted by the
court.

On January 16th, 2024, both parties sought additional time to secure legal
representation. Despite not reviewing any evidence, witness testimonies, or documents
related to the motions, and acknowledging the denial of a previous Emergency Protective
Order, the court mandated my departure from our home within four hours. This
decision, unexpectedly made, awarded custody to the Petitioner, overlooking my
concerns about the adverse effects on our children and my work from home. This ruling,
which both parties did not sign, set the case to resume on January 22nd, 2024, to allow
time for obtaining counsel.”

Following the court's directive, I relocated to my father's residence in Flower Mound until
the subsequent hearing. During this interval, the Petitioner did not take the initiative to
have the children call once and did not provide any information as to how they were
doing, showcasing her lack of empathy and concern for our children’s well-being and
stability. After incurring substantial expenses to secure representation, I detailed my case
and concerns to my attorney, preparing for the next court appearance.

On January 22™, 2024, the Petitioner chose to seek legal representation just minutes
before the hearing was due to start, indicating a disregard for the process. My lawyer
recommended agreeing to a continuance, thereby extending the period I couldn't work
and impacting our established family dynamics. This resulted in a third hearing being set

5. On February 1st, 2024, during the third hearing, the substantive issues I had raised were 
not addressed, nor was there any exchange of evidence between our legal representatives. 
Despite the focus of the hearing supposed to be on the protective order, the discussions 
veered into custody and child support matters. My lawyer presented the sole option of a 
temporary return to the family home for 30 days with expanded visitation rights, coupled 
with a child support obligation starting in April. This outcome, which diverged significantly 
from the case's core issues, compelled me to reconsider my legal representation. 
Consequently, I decided to terminate my attorney's services and embarked on drafting this 
motion myself, aiming to bring the court's attention back to the pivotal elements of the case 
that had thus far been neglected while able to legally reside in my home. 
 
CONCLUSION AND PRAYER 
In conclusion, this motion has laid bare the stark realities and procedural aberrations that have 
marred the essence of justice and due process in the matter of Cause No. 322-744263-23. 
Through the course of these proceedings, it has become abundantly clear that the actions taken 
by the Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, have not only disregarded the welfare and best 
interests of our children but have also illuminated her unfitness as a parent. Her actions speak 
to a pattern of deceit, manipulation, and an unsettling willingness to leverage the judicial 
system for personal vendettas, all at the expense of the emotional and psychological well-being 
of our children. 
 
The court, in its decisions, inadvertently facilitated this troubling trajectory by removing me, 
Charles Dustin Myers, from the lives of our children based on unsubstantiated claims and 
without due consideration of my role as a devoted and stable parent. This oversight has not 
only disrupted the lives of our children but has also significantly impaired my ability to provide 
for them, casting a long shadow over their future stability and welfare. 
 
Moreover, the conduct of my Counsel involved has further compounded these issues, 
demonstrating a distressing disregard for the intricate dynamics and facts of this case. This has 
culminated in a situation where the paramount importance of the children's best interests and 
the fundamental principles of fairness and justice have been overshadowed by procedural 
missteps and a lack of thorough investigation into the Petitioner's fitness as a parent.

Therefore, it is with a heavy hearted yet unwavering resolve that I implore the Court to take 
immediate and decisive action to rectify these wrongs. Specifically, I respectfully request the 
Court to: 
1. Vacate the existing temporary orders that unjustly removed me from my home and 
separated me from my children, restoring the status quo ante until a thorough and 
unbiased evaluation of the facts can be conducted, as the Texas Constitution requires. If 
left as it stands, these orders will further compound the issues at hand, and will 
exacerbate the chaos introduced into the children’s lives. 
2. Set a fair hearing date to delve into the substantive issues at hand, ensuring that all 
parties are given an equitable opportunity to present their case and that the best 
interests of our children are placed at the forefront of all considerations. 
3. Scrutinize any response or new claims from the Petitioner or her counsel with the utmost 
diligence, given the established pattern of deceitful and manipulative behavior exhibited 
by the Petitioner throughout these proceedings. 
4. Consider awarding me full custody of our children, ensuring their continued access to a 
stable, nurturing environment, and the consistent provision of their needs, which I am 
fully committed to upholding. Furthermore, in alignment with my enduring belief in the 
importance of both parents in the lives of our children, I pledge to facilitate and 
encourage a healthy, constructive relationship between the children and their mother, 
provided she demonstrates a genuine commitment to their well-being and stability. 
5. In seeking these remedies, I do so not out of vindictiveness but from a place of deep 
concern for the welfare of our children and a steadfast belief in the principles of justice 
and fairness. Despite the pain and turmoil of these proceedings, my ultimate desire is for 
peace and the best possible outcome for all parties involved, most importantly, our 
children. It is my sincere hope that the Court will recognize the gravity of the situation 
and act in a manner that prioritizes the well-being of our children, ensuring their return 
to a life marked by stability and love. 
 
I affirm under penalty of perjury that all claims herein are true and accurate to the best of my 
knowledge.

Dear Clerk of the Court, 
This letter is submitted on behalf of the Respondent in the above-referenced case to 
provide the court with an update on the Respondent's efforts to uphold the well-being of 
the children under the current agreed arrangements pending review and to navigate the 
complexities of this case. The following reasons why it is impossible for the Respondent 
to vacate the family home under the current agreement pending review are as follows: 
1. Since the inception of the case, the Respondent's primary focus has been to reset 
the status quo ante for the benefit of the children, ensuring their lives remain as 
normal and uninterrupted as possible during this transitory period after it was 
significantly disrupted beginning on January 16th, 2024. Despite the challenges 
posed by the non-suited protective order and the dropped allegations of family 
violence which were the foundations of all decisions made within this case, the 
Respondent has respected the orders pending review, and has strived to provide a 
stable and supportive environment for his children during his designated time, all 
while planning a transition that best suits his children. 
 
2. During the short amount of time the Respondent has been re-instated to his home, 
the Petitioner has, on multiple occasions, entered the residence unannounced and 
without prior consent, actions which stand in stark contrast to her prior requests 
for protection which have governed this case.

3. The Petitioner has changed employers since the signing of the agreement. 
 
4. Petitioner has relinquished custody of the children to the Respondent on multiple 
days during her scheduled time, showcasing the Respondent’s ability to care for 
his children at any time given his at-home work schedule specifically crafted to 
ensure participation in every aspect of his children’s lives remains possible. 
 
 
5. The Respondent must dedicate substantial time to researching and understanding 
legal procedures to ensure compliance with court rules and to advocate effectively 
for the best interests of his children. He is prepared to present all relevant facts 
and evidence at the upcoming hearing on March 14th, should his partial summary 
judgment not be accepted. 
 
6. The Respondent has made efforts over the past 30 days to maintain normalcy for 
his children, showcasing his dedication to their well-being. The Respondent has

Affidavit

However, since December 2023, there has been a notable decline in the
reliability and efficiency of the service provided. This shift coincides with Mr.
Myers facing significant personal and legal challenges, including a divorce
proceeding that has drastically impacted his ability to operate his business
effectively. A particularly distressing development for Mr. Myers has been his
inability to access the physical location where his business equipment and
data connections are housed. This situation has not only disrupted the service
but has also imposed significant financial difficulties on Mr. Myers, threatening
the sustainability of the business and the quality of service that customers
have come to expect.

The repercussions of these challenges have been felt deeply by both Mr.
Myers and his clientele. While the community understands and sympathizes
with Mr. Myers’ personal struggles, the increasing service disruptions have
raised concerns among users about the future reliability and viability of the
service. We are hopeful for a resolution that will allow Mr. Myers to regain
access to his business infrastructure, thereby restoring the service quality and
reliability that we have valued highly. It is in the interest of both Mr. Myers and
his customers to find a solution that addresses these operational challenges
while supporting him through his personal difficulties, ensuring the long-term
success and sustainability of the service. :

This statement serves as a formal declaration of my support for Mr. Charles Myers in light

of recent challenges that have resulted in him being unjustly denied access to his home, where
his business equipment and operations are based. As a paying client for two years prior to this
incident, Mr. Myers maintained a flawless record of uninterrupted service, reflecting his
hardworking nature and commitment to excellence. Mr. Myers's dedication to improving both his
personal capabilities and the quality of his products has been the comerstone of his reputation.
The denial of Mr. Myers's access to his home has not only caused significant service

disruptons but has also resulted in considerable financial losses for Mr. Myers, myself, and other
paying clients that rely on the services that he offers. As someone directly affected by this

situation, | have witnessed firsthand the stress and financial strain placed on Mr. Myers, compounded

Affidavit

THE STATE OF __ Texas

The person who signed this affidavit, appeared in person, before me, the
undersigned notary, and stated under oath:

Christian Michael Vroom

| am of sound mind and capable of making this statement. | have personal knowedge of
the facts written in this statement. | understand that if | lie in this statement, | may be held

My name is

criminally responsible. This statement is true and correct.

I'm signing this affidavit to attest to the work ethic and
dedication of Charles Myers. I've come to rely on the
services he provides in order to gather the required data to
make educated decisions on what and when to enter/exit
options positions. Recently due to him not being at his
normal location of operations the services have had multiple
down times in which Charles was not in a position to be able
to remedy. Some of these down times have led to significant
losses due to making decisions without the necessary data
after already being entered in a position.

Charles' work ethic is unlike anything I've seen in anyone _
l've ever met and h verythi he future of hi |
family. I'm constantly amazed at the feats he is able to pull

off as a one man show. Some things he is able to create

| didn't think were possible but he figures it out through

his endless research and personal development efforts.

Again, everything I've seen him do, he does to give his

|
irls the best life he can and wants the world for them.
I've seen videos of him with his children out at man |
different parks/recreational areas and | can tell that the |

love their father to death and that he would die for them.
| hope his situation is resolved for not only my benefit but
for the sakes of his children and the life he is trying to

provide them with. Charles Myers is both a good person and

amazing father and | would hate to see him and his daughters
robbed of the life he is building that they need and deserve.

EXHIBIT A: TEMPORARY VISITATION ADJUSTMENT PROPOSAL

Respondent: Charles Dustin Myers

Understanding the intricate nature of our family's current situation and the legal complexities involved, |,
Charles Dustin Myers, propose a thoughtful adjustment to the visitation schedule that aligns with our
cohabiting status and the abrupt changes brought about by the divorce announcement.

1. Co-habitation Acknowledgement:

It is acknowledged that both parents currently cohabit, which com plicates traditional custody
arrangements. Therefore, the immediate priority is to facilitate a transition where both parties can
establish their respective independent living and working arrangements without disrupting the children's
lives.

2. Transition Period:

Morgan's Employment: Provide Morgan with the necessary support and time to secure stable
employment, which is vital for her to contribute to the children's needs and establish her own residence,

Stable Housing for Charles: As | seek stable housing to maintain my significant role in our daughters’
lives, flexibility in visitation is essential to ensure | continue to fulfill my parental duties.

3. Work and Research Commitments:

The concurrent legal proceedings, particularly those based on unverified claims, demand a substantial
amount of my time for research and preparation to protect the children's wel l-being.

My ability to work has been affected by the proceedings, necessitating an adjustment in my day-to-day
routine to accommodate these new responsibilities.

4. Interim Custody Logic:

Continuity for Children: While we navigate these proceedings, it is critical to maintain stability and
continuity for our children. Any temporary custody arrangements should reflect the least disruptive path
for them.

Counseling and Mediation: | strongly advocate for counseling or mediation to reconcile and navigate the
divorce process, emphasizing the children's best interests rather than abrupt and contentious changes.

5. Court's Facilitation:

The court's facilitation in endorsing a temporary and flexible visitation framework is crucial. This
framework must account for the current living situation and the significant emotional and logistical
upheaval that the divorce proceedings have caused.

This proposal is made in the spirit of cooperation, with a focus on minimizing the impact of our marital
dissolution on our children. It is with a sincere hope that we can transition into a stable co-parenting
arrangement that keeps our children's welfare as the priority.

Respectfully submitted,

Background Report for Case Consolidation

Case Details:

Divorce Case (Cause No. 322-744263-23) in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County, filed on
December 18, 2023.

Protective Order Case (Cause No. 322-744538-23) in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County.

Reasons for Consolidation:

Interconnected Issues:

The divorce case and the protective order case involve overlapping issues concerning family violence
allegations, which are central to the divorce proceedings and directly affect custody and visitation rights.
The protective order case includes allegations of family violence, which are also a pivotal point in the
divorce case in determining the waiver of the standard waiting period for the divorce.

Consistency in Rulings:

Consolidating the divorce and protective order cases would ensure consistency in the court's findings,
particularly regarding any allegations of family violence and their impact on the dissolution of marriage,
custody, and visitation rights.

Judicial Economy:

Hearing both cases together would promote judicial economy by avoiding duplication of legal
proceedings, as both cases are likely to involve similar witnesses, evidence, and legal arguments,

Claims of False Statements:

There have been claims of false statements and perjury related to the protective order, which could have
significant implications for the divorce case. For instance, the claim that the plaintiff intentionally lied
about being unable to pay court fees and made false allegations of family violence to gain an advantage
in the divorce proceedings suggests that a single judge should hear both matters for a clear
understanding of the facts.

--- OCR TEXT ---
Evidence of Misrepresentation and False Statements:

Evidence provided suggests that there have been misrepresentations to the court, including the transfer
of funds from the joint account and the plaintiff's interaction with third parties, which could affect both
the protective order and the divorce outcome. The protective order — which was based on claims of
family violence — are entirely baseless as | have no record of family violence, and no evidence from the
Plaintiff has been provided to substantiate these claims.

Landlord-Tenant Relationship:

The eviction case, although not directly related to family law matters, stems from claims and actions that
are deeply intertwined with the divorce and protective order cases, suggesting that the alleged family
violence and the actions of the plaintiff have been used to justify an eviction that coincides with the
timing of the divorce and protective order filings.

Conclusion:

Given the overlapping factual and legal issues in the divorce and protective order cases, consolidation
would serve the interests of justice and efficiency. It would ensure that the court has a comprehensive
understanding of the intertwined nature of the family's circumstances, which is vital for fair and
equitable resolution of these matters. While the eviction case may not be directly consolidated due to
jurisdictional differences, it should be considered in context with the other cases to provide a com plete
picture of the ongoing disputes and to keep the best interests of our children intact,

Respectfully submitted,
Charles Myers

IN THE 322ND DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
To the Honorable Judge of the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County: 
REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION
There is a general presumption that an attorney is acting with authority; 
however, that presumption is rebuttable. Breceda v. Whi, 187 S.W.3d 148, 152 
(Tex. App.--El Paso 2006, no pet.); Kelly v. Murphy, 630 S.W.2d 759, 761 
(Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1982, writ ref'd n.r.e.); see also City of San 
Antonio v. Aguilar, 670 S.W.2d 681, 684 (Tex. App.--San Antonio 1984, writ 
dism'd) ("[A]n attorney who has conducted a case in the trial court is 
presumed to have authority to pursue an appeal, although this presumption can 
be rebutted."). Here, however, this presumption is to be rebutted for the 
foregoing reasons:

REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION

There is a general presumption that an attorney is acting with authority;
however, that presumption is rebuttable. Breceda v. Whi, 187 S.W.3d 148, 152
(Tex. App.--El Paso 2006, no pet.); Kelly v. Murphy, 630 S.W.2d 759, 761

presumed to have authority to pursue an appeal, although this presumption can
be rebutted."). Here, however, this presumption is to be rebutted for the

foregoing reasons:

I. Legal Basis for Rule 12 Motion
2. Pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. § 12, a party may challenge an attorney’s
authority to act on behalf of a party in a proceeding. When such a challenge is 
raised, the burden of proof shifts to the challenged attorney to demonstrate 
their authority to represent the party. Id. The attorney must appear before the 
trial court and show sufficient authority to prosecute or defend the suit on 
behalf of their client. (Breceda v. Whi (2006) 187 S.W.3d 148, 152; Kelly v. 
Murphy (1982) 630 S.W.2d 759, 761). 
3. Rule 12 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure permits any party to
challenge an attorney’s authority to prosecute or defend a lawsuit. (See Nolana 
Open MRI Ctr., Inc. v. Pechero (2015) No. 13-13-00552-CV, at *15). The 
purpose of a Rule 12 motion is to protect parties from groundless suits and to 
permit dismissal of suits instituted without authority. (See Nicholas v. Envtl. 
Sys. (Int’l) Ltd. (2016) 499 S.W.3d 888, 895; Angelina Cty. v. McFarland 
(1964) 374 S.W.2d 417, 422–23). 
4. Here, the procedural inconsistencies, lack of formal notice, and
submission of documents by other parties on behalf of Ms. Carter raise 
substantial doubts about whether she possesses the necessary authority to 
represent the Petitioner. Despite being allegedly retained on January 22, 2024, 
Ms. Carter has not filed a formal notice of appearance, leaving her role 
ambiguous. Further complicating matters, filings under her name have been 
submitted by others, including the founder of Marx Altman & Johnson, her 
purported former employer. Coupled with her suspiciously timed State Bar 
profile update and lack of meaningful engagement, these facts compel the 
Respondent to seek clarification and challenge her authority under Rule 12.

II. Procedural Basis
5. No Formal Notice of Appearance Filed. Although Cooper Carter
was allegedly retained on January 22, 2024, she has not filed a formal Notice 
of Appearance in this case. The absence of a Notice of Appearance creates 
substantial ambiguity regarding her authority to represent the Petitioner, 
especially given the procedural irregularities discussed below.  
6. Lack of engagement. Throughout the proceedings, Ms. Carter
has consistently failed to engage in any meaningful way and has failed 
to respond to any pleadings in the suit. 
7. Filings Submitted on Behalf of Cooper Carter. All court
documents and pleadings attributed to Ms. Carter have been submitted "on her 
behalf" by Roderick Marx, the founder of Marx Altman & Johnson. There 
is no indication that Ms. Carter is directly involved in this matter, raising 
significant questions about whether she is properly authorized to act as 
counsel for Morgan Michelle Myers.  
8. Discrepancies in employment. On Ms. Carter’s public social
media, she claims to be a former attorney for Marx Altman & Johnson and 
claims to be employed currently with Cantey Hanger LLP.1 The timeliness of 
her profile aligns with the public article released by Cantey Hanger LLP

current and up-to-date profile. Tex. Gov’t Code § 81.115. Notably, Ms. 
Carter’s profile was updated on March 13th, 2024, one day prior to the only 
hearing that has occurred in this matter3 to her former employer. The 
Respondent has actively been seeking relief from the result of the 
aforementioned hearing for nearly seven months without any engagement or 
any authoritative activity from Ms. Carter, thus warranting this motion. 
III. Prayer and Relief
9. Given the ongoing procedural irregularities and the apparent lack of
clarity surrounding Cooper Carter’s authority to represent Petitioner Morgan 
Myers, the Respondent respectfully requests the following: 
i.
The Court should schedule a hearing requiring Cooper Carter to
personally appear and definitively prove her authority to represent
Morgan Myers, and to provide clarification as to who is involved in
the case, and in what capacity Morgan Michelle Myers is being
represented  in this matter.
ii.
"Upon [her] failure to show such authority, the court shall refuse
to permit the attorney to appear in the cause, and shall strike the
pleadings if no person who is authorized to prosecute or defend
appears." (Tex. R. Civ. P. 12; see Kindle v. Wood Cnty. Elec. Co-op, Inc.
