ARGUMENT
A. Pending Mandamus in the Second Court of Appeals.4
On April 8th, 2024, Relator filed with the Second Court of Appeals 
a Petition for Writ of Mandamus, which was denied with a general denial 
on April 10th, 2024. 
The Second Court of Appeals is currently deliberating on a Motion 
for Rehearing concerning a Petition for Writ of Mandamus filed by the 
Respondent on April 18th, 2024, that corrected procedural defects in 
the initial petition. 
The appellate court's forthcoming decision could significantly alter 
the legal landscape of the underlying issues in this case. Proceeding

redundant judicial efforts and conflicting judicial directives.
