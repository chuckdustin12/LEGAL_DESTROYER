Statement of the Case 
Nature of Underlying Proceeding: This original proceeding arises from a Suit 
Affecting the Parent-Child Relationship ("SAPCR") involving two minor children, 
M.E.M. and C.R.M., in which Relator filed an emergency ex parte application for 
temporary restraining order ("TRO") in the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County, 
Texas. The underlying SAPCR (Cause No. 233-765358-25) was a new proceeding 
initiated by Relator on March 19, 2025, and was answered on March 20, 2025. 
There is a related divorce matter (322-744263-23) that has not been prosecuted 
since April 24, 2024, and no final orders have been rendered. Relator seeks 
declaratory and injunctive relief preventing the Real Party in Interest from barring 
Relator’s from accessing his home, business, and children until valid orders are 
rendered that reflect the children’s best interests. 
Respondent Judge: The Respondent Judge, Kate Stone, is the presiding Associate 
Judge of the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County, Texas. Her office is located at 
200 E. Weatherford St. 5th Floor Fort Worth, TX 76196-0227. 
Respondent’s Challenged Actions and inaction: The trial court refused to hear 
an emergency motion before it on March 28, 2025, and used out-of-court 
statements made by the opposing counsel regarding a forward looking 
consolidation motion that would be filed at a later date, and denied to hear the 
motion after a full hearing date was agreed upon by both parties for April 10, 2025.

Issues Presented 
 
B. Are the March 14, 2024, temporary orders rendered by an Associate 
Judge void ab initio because they explicitly state that all parties agree to 
the terms of the order yet only contain the signatures of the opposing 
party and were never properly adopted by the referring court? 
 
C. Did the Respondent abuse her discretion by failing to perform a clear 
ministerial duty when she refused to consider and rule on Relator's 
properly filed ex parte emergency Application for TRO? 
 
D. Did the Respondent further abuse her discretion un-setting the matter for 
a hearing, and favoring a forward-looking consolidation motion as the 
grounds for denying to hear the emergency TRO before a transfer was 
filed? 
 
E. The Relator has been left without an adequate remedy for an appeal 
because no order resulted from the Respondent judge’s refusal to act on 
Relator’s emergency TRO. 
 
F. Did the Respondent clearly abuse her discretion by excluding any 
exhibits related to the emergency TRO?

ARGUMENT 
A. Mandamus Standard 
Mandamus relief is not merely appropriate but imperative in this case 
because the trial court's inaction and the continued enforcement of a void order 
constitute a clear abuse of discretion for which Relator has no adequate remedy at 
law. The Texas Supreme Court has consistently and unequivocally held that to 
obtain mandamus relief, a Relator must show (1) the trial court clearly abused its 
discretion or violated a duty imposed by law, and (2) there is no adequate remedy 
by appeal. In re Bass, 113 S.W.3d 735, 738 (Tex. 2003) (orig. proceeding); Walker 
v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 839 (Tex. 1992). 
Texas jurisprudence firmly establishes that mandamus will lie to correct a 
void order, even without a traditional showing of inadequate appellate remedy. As 
the Supreme Court of Texas definitively stated in Urbish v. 127th Judicial Dist. 
Court, 708 S.W.2d 429, 431 (Tex. 1986) (orig. proceeding), mandamus will issue 
to correct a void order, i.e., an order the trial court had no power or jurisdiction to 
render. The Court has further emphasized in In re Sw. Bell Tel. Co., 35 S.W.3d 602, 
605 (Tex. 2000) (orig. proceeding) that if an order is void, the Relator need not 
show he lacks an adequate appellate remedy, and mandamus relief is appropriate. 
This principle was recently reaffirmed in In re J.R., No. 02-21-00060-CV, 2021

court explicitly stated: "A trial court abuses its discretion if it enters a void order, 
and mandamus will issue to remedy the void order regardless of whether the relator 
has an adequate remedy by appeal." 
B. The temporary orders rendered on March 14, 2024, are void ab initio 
A fundamental and inviolable principle in Texas jurisprudence is that a 
judgment based on a settlement requires the consent of both parties at the time it is 
rendered by the court. The Texas Supreme Court's seminal decision in Burnaman v. 
Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 (1951) established the bedrock principle that a party 
is free to withdraw their consent to a settlement at any time before the judgment is 
rendered. The Court's language was unambiguous and leaves no room for 
interpretation: "A valid consent judgment cannot be rendered by a court when 
consent of one of the parties thereto is wanting. It is not sufficient that a party's 
consent may at one time have been given; consent must exist at the very moment 
the court undertakes to make the agreement the judgment of the court." Id. This 
principle has been consistently reaffirmed, as in Carter v. Carter, 535 S.W.2d 215 
(Tex. Civ. App. 1976), which emphasized that "the law seems to be clear that a 
consent judgment cannot be rendered by a trial court when consent of one of the 
parties is lacking, even though that consent may have been previously given."

explicitly state "As evidenced by the signatures below, all parties agree to the terms

CONSENTED TO AS TO BOTH FORM AND SUBSTANCE" yet crucially lacks 
the signature of the Relator and his prior counsel. APP 2.38. The Court must 
recognize that the absence of the Relator’s signature is not a mere technical 
deficiency but a fatal jurisdictional flaw that renders the orders void ab initio. 
Because his signature was required to effectuate consent, and the orders themselves 
acknowledge this requirement, the orders are unquestionably void. 
C. Outright refusing to hear the emergency TRO is a clear abuse of discretion  
It is well-settled and beyond legitimate dispute that a trial court has a 
ministerial duty to consider and rule on motions that have been properly filed and 
brought to the court's attention. The Texas Court of Appeals has emphatically 
stated, "When a motion is properly filed and pending before the trial court, the act 
of giving consideration to and ruling upon that motion is a ministerial act, and 
mandamus may issue to compel the trial judge to act." Safety-Kleen Corp. v. 
Garcia, 945 S.W.2d 268, 269 (Tex. App.- San Antonio 1997, orig. proceeding). To 
establish an abuse of discretion for refusal to rule, the relator must show: (1) the 
trial court had a legal duty to perform a nondiscretionary act, (2) the relator 
requested performance of that act, and (3) the trial court failed or refused to do so.

In re Shredder Co., L.L.C., 225 S.W.3d 676, 679 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2006, orig. 
proceeding). 
Here, the Relator properly filed his emergency TRO application in the 233rd 
District Court, meticulously followed all procedural requirements, and appeared at 
the scheduled time to present at 9:00 A.M. on March 28, 2025. SUPP 2.11 The 
Court must recognize that the court's refusal to even consider the application—
based solely on an opposing counsel's unverified, informal representation about a 
future filing in another court—constitutes a clear and inexcusable failure to 
perform a ministerial duty – especially when no response or opposition to the TRO 
was filed by the opposing party and that same party was permitted to interfere with 
the proceedings without being present in the courtroom. SUPP 2.19 
The refusal is particularly troubling because 1) The TRO application 
involved un-opposed allegations of immediate harm to children, which courts are 
obligated to address promptly; 2) the refusal was due to a forward looking 
consolidation motion; 3) even if a motion to consolidate had been filed, it would 
not automatically divest the 233rd Court of jurisdiction until actually granted; and 
4) the proper procedure would have been a motion to transfer, not consolidation. 
See Tex. Fam. Code § 6.407. This misapplication of the law resulted in the refusal 
to hear a properly filed motion to favor a procedurally improper motion that hadn’t 
even been filed yet.

In In re Blakeney, 254 S.W.3d 659, 661 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2008, orig. 
proc.), the court held that mandamus is appropriate when a trial court refuses to 
rule on a properly filed motion and the relator has no adequate remedy by appeal. 
That is precisely the situation here. The 233rd Court's refusal to even consider 
Relator's emergency TRO application has left him with no forum to address his 
urgent concerns about the children's welfare, as the case before the 322nd has been 
procedurally abandoned and Relator has been seeking relief from facially void 
temporary orders to no avail since March 14, 2024, without any opposition from 
the opposing counsel. SUPP 3.2 
D. Improper consolidation does not justify the refusal to act 
The 233rd Court’s refusal to act was based on a fundamentally flawed legal 
premise: that the 322nd District Court had continuing exclusive jurisdiction over 
the children. Under Texas Family Code § 155.001, a court acquires continuing 
exclusive jurisdiction over children only when it renders a “final order” in a 
SAPCR. It is undisputed that the 322nd Court never rendered any final order 
regarding the children. Without a final order, the 322nd Court never acquired 
continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the children. Therefore, the 233rd Court 
was entirely within its authority to hear and rule on Relator’s emergency TRO 
application pursuant to § 155.001.

Moreover, even if the 322nd Court had continuing exclusive jurisdiction 
(which it does not), the proper procedure would have been a motion to transfer 
under the Family Code, not consolidation. Consolidation is appropriate for related 
cases within the same court, not for transferring jurisdiction between courts. By 
refusing to act based on an anticipated consolidation motion, the 233rd Court 
fundamentally misapplied the law, as consolidation cannot be effectuated prior to 
the transfer of the action. Tex. Fam. Code § 6.407. 
Rather, opposing counsel could have filed a plea in abatement but instead 
chose to Respond to the SAPCR after not prosecuting the divorce case since April 
24, 2024. 
E. Relator has been left with no adequate remedy by an appeal 
 
Because the 233rd District Court outright refused to hear the emergency 
TRO before it and the appearance before the court produced no order, the Relator 
has been left without an adequate remedy for an appeal. The Texas Supreme Court 
has recognized that mandamus relief is appropriate when "a party's ability to 
present a viable claim or defense is vitiated or severely compromised." In re 
Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 136 (Tex. 2004). That is precisely the 
situation here. The Relator has diligently sought relief in a one-sided case to no 
avail, and the 233rd SAPCR was opened to escape the abandoned divorce suit that 
hasn't been prosecuted since April 24th, 2024, and has no valid orders in effect.

F. Refusal to accept relevant exhibits central to the emergency TRO 
 
On April 9th, 2025, Relator attempted to file a NOTICE OF INCLUSION 
with the trial court, which included critical exhibits related to the emergency TRO. 
The Judge refused outright to permit Relator to include any exhibits related to the 
TRO in the rejection comments. SUPP 2.13, 2.16 When contacting the clerk's 
office, no substantive response was received from the court coordinator. The 
returned comment stated: "Judge’s request. Please resubmit without the attached 
exhibits" without citing any legal authority, statute, rule, or local procedure 
justifying this rejection. SUPP 1.1. 
This rejection by the clerk constitutes a clear violation of the Texas Rules of 
Civil Procedure. Rule 21(f)(11) states: "The clerk may not refuse to file a 
document that fails to conform with this rule." Instead, the rule provides that the 
clerk "may identify the error to be corrected and state a deadline for the party to 
resubmit the document in a conforming format." Here, the clerk provided no 
specific error to be corrected, and no legal basis for the rejection outside of “we are 
unable to accept any exhibits into the case”. SUPP 1.1 By doing so, the Relator has 
been deprived of essential privileges to make a record pursuant to Tex. Const Art.

that the real party in interest ever intended to move the dormant divorce proceeding

APP 1.2
The children are suffering daily from their father being prevented
access to the marital home. The Respondent has prevented access
since March 6, 2024, knowing the Petitioner's need for the residence to work.
This has left the children without the care of either parent for the majority
of the time, and are being told that the divorce has been finalized
and that their father is a bad person.
Prior to the Respondent's removal, the Children were cared for both emotionally and financially by the Petitioner. The Respondent
knowingly and willingly sabotaged this relationship to further her own agenda with a separate relationship.
The emotional well-being and stability of the children have been destroyed, and their stable life has been dismantled
by the Respondent in bad faith. There exists no legal basis for the current situation to persist,
and the children are already showing signs of distress, emotional trauma, and are beginning to struggle academically.
The children need the Petitioner's stable, nurturing care during this difficult time, and they will soon lose all access to their Father who will be homless given the circumstances.
The Petitioner has been fighting for over a year to get back into his residence to no avail. The Respondent has refused to participate, and 
continues to prioritize her new relationship over the children. Notice would only spark more deceptive legal actions from the Respondent to try and subvert justice.

Texas Family Code - FAM § 155.001. Acquiring Continuing,
Exclusive Jurisdiction

Current as of January 01, 2024 | Updated by FindLaw Staff

(a) Except as otherwise provided by this section, a court acquires continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the
matters provided for by this title in connection with a child on the rendition of a final order.

(b) The following final orders do not create continuing, exclusive jurisdiction in a court:
(1) a voluntary or involuntary dismissal of a suit affecting the parent-child relationship;

(2) in a suit to determine parentage, a final order finding that an alleged or presumed father is not the
father of the child, except that the jurisdiction of the court is not affected if the child was subject to the
jurisdiction of the court or some other court in a suit affecting the parent-child relationship before the
commencement of the suit to adjudicate parentage; and

(3) a final order of adoption, after which a subsequent suit affecting the child must be commenced as
though the child had not been the subject of a suit for adoption or any other suit affecting the parent-
child relationship before the adoption.

(c) If a court of this state has acquired continuing, exclusive jurisdiction, no other court of this state has
jurisdiction of a suit with regard to that child except as provided by this chapter, Section 103.001(b), or
Chapter 262.

(d) Unless a final order has been rendered by a court of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction, a subsequent suit
shall be commenced as an original proceeding.
