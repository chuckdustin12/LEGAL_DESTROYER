Respondent.

TO THE HONORABLE COURT:

Respondent Charles D. Myers files this Plea to the Jurisdiction, seeking dismissal of this

matter in its’ entirety, and in support thereof, shows the following:
I. INTRODUCTION

The Court’s temporary orders in this matter—beginning with a January 16, 2024 order
that compelled Respondent to vacate his residence without statutory authority or due process—
are void ab initio. At no point did the Court lawfully acquire jurisdiction to enter the
extraordinary relief imposed. All subsequent orders (including “agreed” temporary orders
entered without Respondent’s consent) derive from the initial void act and are likewise null.
Respondent therefore requests that the Court dismiss the case and vacate all temporary orders
and associate judge’s reports as legally null and void, so that any further proceedings, if
watranted, occur only under proper jurisdiction and due process of law. The Court has
repeatedly exceeded its lawful authority — including removing Respondent from his residence

without the

required findings or protective order, and signing a “consent” Temporary Order that Respondent 
never agreed to. Because the Court’s actions transcended its statutory jurisdiction and 
constitute procedural fraud, Respondent respectfully prays that the Court dismiss this case in its 
entirety for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. 
II. Factual and Procedural Background
The record reveals a pattern of the Court acting beyond its jurisdiction: on January 16, 
2024, the Court ousted Respondent from the marital residence without any finding of family 
violence or protective order; on March 26, 2024, the Court entered “Agreed” Temporary 
Orders without Respondent’s consent, flouting the statutory procedures for entry of such 
orders. These actions violate Respondent’s due process rights and the Texas Family Code. Under 
Texas law, orders issued without jurisdiction or in the absence of a party’s consent are void 
and cannot confer jurisdiction. Respondent asks the Court to recognize these fundamental defects 
and dismiss this proceeding as a matter of law. 
On January 16, 2024, at a show-cause setting, the District Judge ordered Respondent to 
vacate the marital residence by 2:00 p.m. that same day, awarded the residence to Petitioner, and 
gave Petitioner temporary possession of the parties’ children. This “kick-out” order was issued 
without any evidentiary hearing or testimony – indeed, the matter was continued – and with 
no findings of family violence. The court did not issue a protective order under Title 4 of the 
Texas Family Code, nor did it enter any written findings of fact or conclusions of law to justify 
excluding Respondent from his home. Respondent did not consent to this order, which was 
rendered unilaterally by the court in the absence of the procedural safeguards required by 
law. (TAB A)

This order was issued without the statutory findings required by Tex. Fam. Code 
§§ 83.006 and 85.001, and no Protective Order was ever obtained. The January 16 order
consolidated the separate protective order proceeding into this divorce cause, yet at no point did 
the Court find that family violence occurred or issue a Protective Order as mandated by law. It 
simply extended these unlawful orders. 
A. Extensions and Temporary Orders Proceedings
The January 16 exclusion order was subsequently extended and carried forward. At a 
January 22, 2024, hearing before the Associate Judge, the temporary orders hearing was again 
continued, but the exclusion of Respondent from the home remained in effect. The court did 
permit Respondent a short period of visitation with the children on January 26–28, 2024, but 
Respondent had to ask his attorney to have that provision added. (TAB B) 
B. February 1, 2024 – Associate Judge’s Hearing and Report with Agreed Terms
On February 1st, 2024, an Associate Judge was drafted by Dan Bacalis, not the presiding 
judge, and the Report was signed by counsel for all parties that had specific requirements 
regarding the agreement’s reduction to writing. They included: 
1. “A typed written Order conforming to this Report will follow within 20 days from the
date this Report is signed.” The Report was signed on February 1, 2024; thus a
written order was due by February 21, 2024
2. “The Temporary Order shall be prepared by Dan Bacalis.” At the time, Dan Bacalis
was Respondent’s attorney of record, and the Court specifically assigned him to draft
the order.

B. February 1, 2024 — Associate Judge’s Hearing and Report with Agreed Terms

On February 1*', 2024, an Associate Judge was drafted by Dan Bacalis, not the presiding
judge, and the Report was signed by counsel for all parties that had specific requirements

regarding the agreement’s reduction to writing. They included:

1. “A typed written Order conforming to this Report will follow within 20 days from the
date this Report is signed.” The Report was signed on February 1, 2024; thus a
written order was due by February 21, 2024

2. “The Temporary Order shall be prepared by Dan Bacalis.”’ At the time, Dan Bacalis
was Respondent’s attorney of record, and the Court specifically assigned him to draft

the order.

3. “Each attorney should approve the Order. The parties do not need to approve the
Order. The attorney reviewing the proposed Order shall have five (5) days to do so.
There are no ten (10) day letters.” In other words, once Mr. Bacalis prepared the
draft, opposing counsel (Cooper L. Carter for Petitioner) would have 5 days to review
and approve or object. The approval was to be attorney-only; the parties themselves
were not required to sign off.
4. “If an agreement is not reached, a Motion to Sign shall be filed and set within thirty
(30) days from the signing of this Report.” Thus, by approximately March 2, 2024 (30
days from Feb 1), if the attorneys could not agree on the form of the order, the proper 
procedure was to file a Motion to Enter (Sign) the temporary order and obtain a ruling 
from the Court.  
Both parties and their attorneys signed the Feb 1st Associate Judge’s Report, expressly 
agreeing to its terms and the process outlined for entering the written Temporary Orders. The 
Report was marked “AGREED” and signed by Petitioner (through counsel Cooper Carter) and 
Respondent (through counsel Dan Bacalis) as “Agreed as to Form and Substance,” and was 
approved by the Associate Judge on February 1, 2024. (TAB C) 
C. March 14, 2024 – Further due process violaitons
Following February 1, 2024, the responsibility to draft the Temporary Orders fell to 
Respondent’s then-attorney, Mr. Bacalis, per the court’s directive. However, Mr. Bacalis couldn’t 
have prepared and circulated any draft within the 20-day period (by Feb. 21, 2024) because he 
was specifically terminated by the Respondent to prevent the fraudulent basis for this agreement 
from ever being formalized. (TAB D)

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
After Bacalis’s exit, Respondent challenged the orders via an emergency motion, and 
Petitioner’s attorney, Cooper L. Carter, never responded. (TAB E) Instead, she took it upon 
herself to draft the temporary orders despite the Feb 1st AJR’s directive that Respondent’s 
attorney would draft it. Moreover, Ms. Carter’s eventual draft did not conform in all respects to 
the Feb 1st agreement. Notable discrepancies (material differences) in the draft Temporary 
Orders included, for example: 1) different times that the parties would remain in the home, 2) 
temporary injunctions not present in the February 1st report, and 3) did not have the correct email 
address or residential address. These terms went beyond or conflicted with what was pronounced 
and agreed in the Feb 1 hearing, effectively rewriting portions of the parties’ agreement to 
Petitioner’s advantage. (TAB F)  
Finally, despite an agreement clearly not being met, the Associate Judge compelled 
Respondent to sign them in violation of the prior agreement and without explanation. Such a 
gross miscarriage of justice and disregard for Respondent’s constitutional violations cannot be 
overlooked. Crucially, page one of the orders claim that all parties consent to the terms, that the 
court heard a motion on February 1st for temporary orders, yet are missing crucial signatures 
from both Respondent and his prior counsel, and are based off of a hearing that never took place 
and that cannot be found on the case docket. 
III. Lack of Statutory Authority for Excluding Respondent From Home and Children
Texas Family Code § 83.006 strictly limits a court’s authority to exclude a party from 
their residence. A person may only be excluded from their residence if the applicant: (1) files a 
sworn affidavit with a detailed description of the facts requiring exclusion, and (2) appears in 
person to testify at the hearing to justify issuance. Tex. Fam. Code § 83.006(a). Moreover, before 
rendering such an order, the court must find from the affidavit and testimony that:

from both Respondent and his prior counsel, and are based off of a hearing that never took place

and that cannot be found on the case docket.

Ill. Lack of Statutory Authority for Excluding Respondent From Home and Children

Texas Family Code § 83.006 strictly limits a court’s authority to exclude a party from
their residence. A person may only be excluded from their residence if the applicant: (1) files a
sworn affidavit with a detailed description of the facts requiring exclusion, and (2) appears in
person to testify at the hearing to justify issuance. Tex. Fam. Code § 83.006(a). Moreover, before

rendering such an order, the court must find from the affidavit and testimony that:

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
1. The applicant resides on the premises (or did within the past 30 days);
2. The person to be excluded committed family violence within the past 30 days; and
3. There is a clear and present danger that the excluded person is likely to commit
family violence in the immediate future.
See Tex. Fam. Code § 83.006(b)(1)–(3). 
Likewise, Texas Family Code § 85.001 requires that at “the close of a hearing on an 
application for a protective order, the court shall find whether family violence has occurred.” 
Tex. Fam. Code § 85.001(a). If such a finding is made, a protective order must issue against the 
perpetrator of family violence. Id. § 85.001(b)(1). In this case, however, no protective order was 
ever issued. At the subsequent hearing dates (January 22, 2024 and beyond), the court did not 
make the required finding that family violence occurred and indeed granted a continuance 
instead of conducting a full hearing on the merits to continue the deprivation. Ultimately, rather 
than issue a protective order as the law mandates upon a finding of family violence or deny the 
application outright, the court transitioned to ordinary temporary orders under the divorce 
proceeding – without ever fulfilling the requirements of Chapter 85.  
In short, the statutory process designed to lawfully divest a parent of home possession or 
child custody (via a protective order) was never completed. Without a valid protective order in 
place, the court lacked jurisdiction to continue enforcing the extreme relief originally granted to 
the Mother. Any further exercise of power over the Respondent’s residence or parenting rights 
was ultra vires and void. 
Because the trial court failed to follow the Texas Family Code’s jurisdictional safeguards, 
the initial and subsequent orders were entered without lawful authority. A trial court “lacks

Tex. Fam. Code § 85.001(a). If such a finding is made, a protective order must issue against the
perpetrator of family violence. Jd. § 85.001(b)(1). In this case, however, no protective order was
ever issued. At the subsequent hearing dates (January 22, 2024 and beyond), the court did not
make the required finding that family violence occurred and indeed granted a continuance

jurisdiction” to enter an order that does not comply with explicit statutory prerequisites for that 
order. The proper remedy is to declare such orders void and dismiss the claims that gave rise to 
them. Respondent respectfully demands the Court to do so here. 
IV. Violation of Respondent’s Constitutional Rights to Due Process and Family Integrity 
The trial court’s actions not only violated statute but also trampled Respondent’s 
fundamental constitutional rights. By evicting the Respondent from his home and effectively 
separating him from his children with no prior notice or opportunity to be heard, the court 
deprived him of liberty and property without due process of law. This violates Article I, § 19 of 
the Texas Constitution (the “due course of law” guarantee) and the Fourteenth Amendment to 
the U.S. Constitution. Now, the court seeks to finalize this fundamental error amidst an ongoing 
appeal, showing a continuous and complete disregard for the Respondent’s rights.  
A. Deprivation of Property Without Due Process 
The January 16 order forced Respondent to vacate his own home on the same day it was 
issued. A person’s right to occupy their home is a significant property interest, protected by due 
process. Yet Respondent was ousted immediately, with no notice that such relief would be sought 
and no chance to contest the allegations. The Texas Constitution and the 14th Amendment both 
forbid the State from depriving any person of property without due process of law. Fuentes v. 
Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 81-82 (1972) (even temporary, non-final deprivations of property require 
notice and hearing absent extraordinary circumstances). While Texas law does allow ex parte 
orders in truly exigent circumstances, those orders must be narrowly tailored and followed 
promptly by a full hearing. Here, the statutory requirements for an ex parte kick-out were 
disregarded, and Respondent was left homeless and separated from his belongings based on one-

deprived him of liberty and property without due process of law. This violates Article I, § 19 of

A. Deprivation of Property Without Due Process

The January 16 order forced Respondent to vacate his own home on the same day it was
issued. A person’s right to occupy their home is a significant property interest, protected by due
process. Yet Respondent was ousted immediately, with no notice that such relief would be sought
and no chance to contest the allegations. The Texas Constitution and the 14° Amendment both
forbid the State from depriving any person of property without due process of law. Fuentes v.

promptly by a full hearing. Here, the statutory requirements for an ex parte kick-out were

disregarded, and Respondent was left homeless and separated from his belongings based on one-

sided assertions. This is precisely the kind of state action that due process is meant to guard 
against. 
B. Deprivation of Parental Rights Without Due Process 
Even more critically, the court’s orders infringed Respondent’s fundamental right to 
parent his children, also without due process. A parent’s interest in the care, custody, and control 
of their children is fundamental. The United States Supreme Court has recognized that “the 
interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children…is perhaps the oldest of the 
fundamental liberty interests recognized by this Court.” Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 
(2000) (plurality op.). Likewise, the Texas Supreme Court has affirmed that “the fundamental 
right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children” is 
constitutionally protected. In re C.J.C., 603 S.W.3d 804, 811 (Tex. 2020) (citing Troxel, 530 U.S. 
at 66). Governmental interference with this right is subject to strict scrutiny and must be 
accomplished only with rigorous procedural safeguards. 
Here, Respondent’s removal from the home effectively altered custody of the children 
without any hearing or finding of unfitness. Respondent went from being an equal managing 
conservator of the children to having zero possession or access (by virtue of being excluded from 
the home and the children’s presence) overnight and without notice. This is a profound 
deprivation of parental rights. As the U.S. Supreme Court held in Stanley v. Illinois, an unwed 
father could not be presumed unfit and have his children taken without a hearing – “the Due 
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that [a father] be given a hearing on 
his fitness as a parent before his children are removed from his custody.” Stanley v. Illinois, 405 
U.S. 645, 649 (1972) (emphasis added). The State “cannot, consistently with due process, 
merely presume” a parent’s unfitness or danger and bypass a hearing; “parental unfitness

sided assertions. This is precisely the kind of state action that due process is meant to guard

against.

B. Deprivation of Parental Rights Without Due Process

Even more critically, the court’s orders infringed Respondent’s fundamental right to
parent his children, also without due process. A parent’s interest in the care, custody, and control
of their children is fundamental. The United States Supreme Court has recognized that “the
interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children...is perhaps the oldest of the
fundamental liberty interests recognized by this Court.” Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65
(2000) (plurality op.). Likewise, the Texas Supreme Court has affirmed that “the fundamental
right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children” is
constitutionally protected. In re C.J.C., 603 S.W.3d 804, 811 (Tex. 2020) (citing Troxel, 530 U.S.
at 66). Governmental interference with this right is subject to strict scrutiny and must be

accomplished only with rigorous procedural safeguards.

Here, Respondent’s removal from the home effectively altered custody of the children
without any hearing or finding of unfitness. Respondent went from being an equal managing
conservator of the children to having zero possession or access (by virtue of being excluded from
the home and the children’s presence) overnight and without notice. This is a profound
deprivation of parental rights. As the U.S. Supreme Court held in Stanley v. Illinois, an unwed
father could not be presumed unfit and have his children taken without a hearing — “the Due
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that [a father] be given a hearing on
his fitness as a parent before his children are removed from his custody.” Stanley v. Illinois, 405
U.S. 645, 649 (1972) (emphasis added). The State “cannot, consistently with due process,

merely presume” a parent’s unfitness or danger and bypass a hearing; “parental unfitness

must be established on the basis of individualized proof” before a child is taken away. Id. at 
647, 649. Yet in Respondent’s case, the court did exactly what Stanley forbids – it presumed the 
necessity of removing the father, without any adversarial testing of the evidence or finding of 
actual misconduct and left the determination for later (a hearing that kept getting postponed). 
This violated Respondent’s procedural due process rights to be heard before being deprived of 
custody of his children. 
Moreover, the substantive aspect of due process was violated. There is a “strong 
presumption that the best interest of a child is served by remaining with a fit parent.” Troxel, 
530 U.S. at 68-69. The government may not “infringe on the fundamental right of parents to 
make child rearing decisions simply because a state judge believes a ‘better decision’ could 
be made.” Id. at 72 (plurality op.). In the absence of any evidence or finding that Respondent 
was an unfit or dangerous parent, removing his children from him was an arbitrary infringement 
on his fundamental liberty interest. The orders entered in this case prioritized a one-sided 
allegation over a father’s constitutional rights, in a manner repugnant to both the Texas and U.S. 
Constitutions. Article I, Section 19 of the Texas Constitution guarantees that no citizen shall be 
deprived of liberty or property except by the due course of the law of the land – here, 
Respondent was deprived of both without the lawful procedures or any adjudication of 
wrongdoing. 
In sum, the process (or lack thereof) employed by the court fell far short of constitutional 
requirements. This constitutional infirmity is independently sufficient to render the court’s orders 
void. A judgment entered in violation of due process is void and subject to collateral attack. 
Peralta v. Heights Medical Center, Inc., 485 U.S. 80, 84-85 (1988) (judgment rendered without 
proper notice violates due process and is void). The proper remedy for a void order that stems

Peralta v. Heights Medical Center, Inc., 485 U.S. 80, 84-85 (1988) (judgment rendered without

proper notice violates due process and is void). The proper remedy for a void order that stems

from a due process violation is to declare it a nullity and dismiss any action that cannot proceed 
without it. 
V. The January 16 Order Was Void Ab Initio – Subsequent Orders Cannot Cure Its Defects 
Because the January 16, 2024, eviction order was void from the outset (for the reasons 
above), all later orders flowing from it are likewise null. It is a fundamental principle that a void 
order has no force or effect, and any orders predicated on a void order are themselves void. See 
In re C.L., 933 S.W.2d 402, 405 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1996, no writ) (orders that are void ab 
initio cannot form the basis for any valid subsequent judgment). Here, the entire temporary order 
structure of this case rests on the initial, illegally obtained kick-out order that set the stage for all 
future proceedings. By removing Respondent and giving Petitioner sole possession of the 
children and home, the January 16 order fundamentally reshaped the status quo without 
jurisdiction. Every interim “agreement” or order thereafter was simply an extension of that initial 
improper removal: 
i. 
The Associate Judge’s temporary orders and continuances in late January and February 
2024 were aimed at maintaining or slightly modifying the arrangements created by the 
Jan. 16 order (e.g. permitting limited visitation to Respondent, while he remained 
excluded from the home and primary custody). These too lack validity because they 
derive from an initial void act and never rectified the absence of a family-violence 
finding or due process. 
ii. The March 26, 2024 “Agreed” Temporary Orders are likewise void. Not only do they 
flow from the void January 16 order, but they also fail on their own merits due to lack of 
actual consent. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 11 provides that no agreement between

ii. The March 26, 2024 “Agreed” Temporary Orders are likewise void. Not only do they
flow from the void January 16 order, but they also fail on their own merits due to lack of

actual consent. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 11 provides that no agreement between

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
attorneys or parties is enforceable unless it is in writing and signed by the parties (or 
their attorneys) and filed with the court, or made in open court on the record. Here, the 
March 26 order purports to be “Approved and Consented to as to both form and 
substance,” yet Respondent never signed it. The signature block for “CHARLES 
MYERS, Respondent” and his prior attorney are blank. There is also no indication that 
Respondent personally agreed to its terms in open court. While the parties did agree to 
the terms set forth in the February 1st, 2024, agreement, those terms were grossly violated 
by the same judge that memorialized them. 
In effect, the March 26 order attempted to paper over the void January 16 order by 
getting the parties to agree to temporary terms. But a void order cannot be retroactively cured by 
agreement, especially not an agreement that is itself procedurally defective. If a gunman forces 
someone to “agree” to hand over their property, the law does not recognize that coerced 
agreement as valid consent. Likewise, here, Respondent’s so-called agreement, coming on the 
heels of an unlawful eviction and under threat of continued loss of his children, is no true 
agreement at all – and in any event was never properly memorialized under Rule 11 or any valid 
legal authority. 
Because the initial and subsequent temporary orders are void, they do not bar 
Respondent’s challenge. Void orders may be challenged at any time, and a plea to the 
jurisdiction is a proper mechanism to bring such a challenge, as a court has no “jurisdiction” to 
enforce or continue a void order. Travelers Ins. Co. v. Joachim, 315 S.W.3d 860, 863 (Tex. 
2010) (a judgment may be void for lack of jurisdiction or due process, and such issues can be 
raised at any time). Respondent has not “waived” any objection by purportedly agreeing to

VI. Fundamental Parental Rights Demand Dismissal of this Suit 
Finally, the Court should view this case through the lens of the fundamental 
constitutional right at stake – a parent’s right to raise his children. This is not a typical dispute 
between private parties that the court can resolve in equity; it is a situation where the machinery 
of the State has, without lawful basis, inserted itself into the private realm of the family and 
disrupted a father-child relationship. The Fourteenth Amendment protects the parent-child 
relationship as a liberty interest against unwarranted state intrusion. Troxel, 530 U.S. at 65. Texas 
law echoes that protection: “the natural right which exists between parents and their children is 
of constitutional dimension.” Wiley v. Spratlan, 543 S.W.2d 349, 352 (Tex. 1976). Courts must 
be especially vigilant that any interference with this right strictly comports with due process and 
statutory authority. 
In this case, the court’s jurisdiction was invoked (via Petitioner’s filings) to address 
allegations of family violence and to determine conservatorship of the children. But when the 
court failed to follow the required procedure and instead issued orders in excess of its power, it 
lost the legitimate ability to adjudicate those issues. The remedy is dismissal – to clear the slate 
of this legally unauthorized proceeding. Dismissing the case will vindicate Respondent’s 
constitutional rights by confirming that the State cannot, even temporarily, take away a parent’s 
rights without due process and proper cause. Petitioner is not left without options – she may 
pursue lawful remedies in compliance with the Family Code and constitutional norms – but this 
proceeding, tainted from the start, cannot continue.

Most disturbing is that this record is filled with evidence supporting the basis for this case 
is fraudulent, yet the court continues to proceed as if the Respondent hasn’t been seeking relief 
from the very start of this case. The court has significantly prejudiced the Respondent, and this 
case must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. A court cannot hear a case that was 
void from the very beginning. Therefore, if a judge orders a parent to vacate the residence 
without making the mandatory findings under the Texas Family Code, it would exceed the 
statutory authority afforded to it. Here, that is what occurred. 
VII. RULING AS A MATTER OF LAW
The relevant jurisdictional facts in this case are not in dispute. The trial court issued its 
January 16, 2024, exclusion order without holding an evidentiary hearing, without entering 
findings of family violence, and without issuing a protective order pursuant to Title 4 of the 
Texas Family Code. The March 26, 2024 “Temporary Orders” were entered without 
Respondent’s consent or signature, in violation of Rule 11 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. 
The record plainly reflects that Respondent objected to the terms of the proposed agreement and 
refused to approve the order either as to form or substance. There is no genuine issue of material 
fact on these points. 
On February 22, 2024, Respondent filed and served a motion for partial summary 
judgment raising these same jurisdictional and constitutional defects. (TAB G) That motion is 
the earliest dispositive pleading on file and remains unrebutted. It details, with supporting 
exhibits, that the underlying allegations of family violence were dismissed by non-suit, that no 
hearing was ever held prior to Respondent’s removal from the home, and that the temporary 
orders issued thereafter continued to impose unlawful restrictions on Respondent’s residence and 
custodial rights without any adjudication or due process.

The standard governing this plea is well established. In Texas Department of Parks & 
Wildlife v. Miranda, the Texas Supreme Court held that when the relevant evidence is undisputed 
or fails to raise a fact question on the jurisdictional issue, the trial court must rule on a plea to the 
jurisdiction as a matter of law. See Tex. Dep’t of Parks & Wildlife v. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d 217, 
228 (Tex. 2004). This standard mirrors that of a traditional summary judgment under Texas Rule 
of Civil Procedure 166a(c), and has been affirmed in subsequent appellate decisions such as 
Jenkins v. TKC Management Services, Inc., 307 S.W.3d 854, 857 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2010, no 
pet.). 
Because the record is devoid of any controverting evidence regarding the lack of a 
protective order, the absence of findings, the lack of a hearing, and the unauthorized nature of the 
orders entered, Respondent’s jurisdictional challenge must be sustained. No factual development 
is needed. The trial court is obligated to rule as a matter of law and cannot proceed further on the 
merits without first resolving this jurisdictional defect in writing. To do otherwise would 
contravene both Rule 166a and the constitutional requirement that courts act only within the 
bounds of their lawful authority.  
Accordingly, Respondent respectfully notifies the Court and all parties that he will not 
appear at or participate in any further proceedings in this matter until the Court resolves this 
jurisdictional challenge in writing. Proceeding on the merits while this plea remains pending 
would not only be legally improper under Miranda but would also constitute a continuing denial 
of Respondent’s due process rights under Article I, Section 19 of the Texas Constitution and the 
Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The court must provide its’ written 
explanation or dismiss the case.

VIII. Prayer
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Respondent Charles Myers respectfully 
prays that the Court grant this Plea to the Jurisdiction and dismiss all pending claims with 
prejudice and orders in this matter for want of jurisdiction.  
Respondent further prays that this Court acknowledge that its prior orders—entered 
without findings, without consent, and without due process—cannot be laundered into legitimacy 
by mere passage of time or mischaracterized agreement. The Court may not allow what began as 
a jurisdictionally void exclusion from the marital home and children to evolve into a presumed 
“settlement” by silence, while simultaneously ignoring Respondent’s repeated objections and 
procedural challenges. 
The judiciary cannot finalize fraud. Nor can it exceed its lawful authority to impose 
injunctive relief, conservatorship restrictions, and possession orders without jurisdiction, 
evidence, or statutory compliance. Respondent prays that this Court restore the constitutional 
order, vacate all void temporary and associate judge’s orders, and reaffirm that even in family 
law, due process and the rule of law are not optional. 
Respondent prays for all such other and further relief, in law or in equity, to which he 
may be justly entitled. 
Respectfully submitted,

Petitioner,

Emergency Motion to Reconsider
Evidence and to Vacate Temporary
Orders

Charles Dustin Myers,

Respondent

This motion urgently calls for the Court's intervention to address critical procedural
missteps in the matter of cause# 322-744263-23, aiming to reinstate the safety and stability
that our children rightfully deserve until due process and all facts of the case can be considered
by the Court. I am seeking immediate court intervention to correct procedural errors and
address the misuse of the legal system by the Petitioner. This motion highlights the significant
impact of the Petitioner's actions on our children's welfare and my unjust removal from our
home based on frivolous claims.

In pursuit of justice and the well-being of the children at heart, I respectfully request that
the Court reconsider all details, weighing the comprehensive scenario presented herein along
with the supporting evidence. I am committed to the highest interests of my children and
family, striving to resolve these matters efficiently and avoid unnecessary judicial expenditure.
This document seeks to unveil the Petitioner’s deliberate misrepresentation and misuse of the
legal system, which has gravely disrupted our children's stability and emotional well-being by
weaponizing the court system.

1 On December 1st, 2023, the Petitioner announced her desire for a divorce with no plan in place to preserve our
familial stability, with no desire for counseling or communication, and with no consideration of the timing around
the holiday season, nor any sign of marital discord warranting such a decision leading up to this announcement.

2 Between December 14th, 2023, and December 22nd, 2023, the Petitioner filed for an Emergency Protective
Order, a Divorce Petition, a Protective Order, and instigated an Eviction suit.

NATURE OF SUITS AND THIRD-PARTY INFLUENCE 
1. On December 1st, 2023, Petitioner announced the divorce with no plan in place for the 
children, no sign of marital discord leading up to this point to warrant such a decision, 
and no desire for counseling, communication, and no consideration for the time of year.  
 
2. Between December 1st, 2023, and December 12th, 2023, all efforts are exhausted in an 
attempt to communicate with the Petitioner which lead to the subsequent discovery of an 
alarming volume of text messages that were directed towards two individuals – Debbie 
Price and Damen Kazlauskas, showing a significant level of influence.³ 
 
 
3. On December 12th, 2023, After the discovery of the communications between these two 
individuals combined with the irrational behavior from the Petitioner during such a 
critical time of year, I reached out to the Petitioner’s grandfather via text message.⁴ 
 
4. On December 13th, 2023, Petitioner states she will be going to talk to her Grandparents 
alone. This conversation lasts between 9:55 and 1:30 A.M. 
 
 
5. On December 14th, 2023, Petitioner filed for an Emergency Protective Order. This order 
was denied by the court.  
 
6. On December 15th, 2023, Petitioner involves her family into the situation.       
Particularly, Dan Branthoover became involved. He is the boyfriend of the Petitioner’s 
Mother. Shortly thereafter, I received a notice from our joint bank account stating that 
$1,576 had just been withdrawn. As our bank statement for December 2023 will 
demonstrate – the transaction record shows the funds being transferred directly to Mr. 
Branthoover’s PayPal account.⁵

include Meme, Papaw, Damen, Debbie, and Dan. Dates and times surrounding the case will corroborate with other

7. On December 16th, 2023, Petitioner’s transaction under the advice of Mr. Branthoover 
lead to our joint bank account becoming $-800 overdrawn. I requested from Mr. 
Branthoover via text message that he needs to return the funds immediately, where he 
subsequently admits to this transaction having occurred.⁶ 
 
8. On December 17th, 2023, Petitioner’s grandmother, Margie Wilson, initiates an Eviction 
Suit by serving me an eviction notice around 11:00 AM CST.

12. On December 28th, 2023, I am served the Protective Order, followed by the Eviction 
shortly thereafter by the Constable.  
 
The Protective Order (Show Cause) hearing was set for January 16th, 2024, and the Eviction 
hearing for January 17th, 2024. 
The documented timeline of events, particularly during the holiday season, underscores a 
notable disregard for our children's welfare. This has enabled the Petitioner to inappropriately 
utilize the judicial system to disrupt the stable environment our children have known, 
influenced significantly by third-party actions as previously detailed. The forthcoming section of 
this motion will highlight the specific frivolous claims and false statements found within each 
filing initiated by the Petitioner.

FRIVOLOUS CLAIMS AND FALSE STATEMENTS 
A. EMERGENCY PROTECTIVE ORDER 
1. As mentioned above, Petitioner filed for an Emergency Protective Order on 
December 14th, 2023. This protective order was denied by the courts. 
2. Due to the fact this order was not granted by the court, one could conclude that 
there was not a clear and present danger of family violence.¹ 
B. THE DIVORCE PETITION 
1. Petition was filed on 2024-12-18 under an Affidavit of Inability to pay.² 
2. The Petitioner's action of filing for divorce under an Affidavit of Inability to pay 
three days after transferring $1,576 to herself starkly contravenes the mandates 
set forth in Chapter 10, Section 10.001 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code. This 
section asserts that each claim or legal contention must be warranted by existing 
law or a nonfrivolous argument for the modification of existing law or the 
establishment of new law, and that each factual contention has or is likely to have 
evidentiary support after further investigation or discovery³.  
3. The Petitioner violated Chapter 10, Section 10.001 a second time within the 
same document when she intentionally elected to waive the 60-day waiting 
period claiming to have an active protective order against me that found family 
violence had occurred during our marriage⁴ despite being denied such an order 
just five days prior on December 14th, 2023.  
5. The final page of the Divorce Petition for service to the Office of the Attorney 
General was left unsigned by the Petitioner.

C. EVICTION SUIT 
1. The suit was unlawful by nature⁵, as the grounds for eviction were based on 
family status, referencing the divorce as well as a protective order that had been 
denied on December 14th, 2023. The suit was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction on 
January 17th, 2024.⁶ 
 
D. PROTECTIVE ORDER 
1. This suit was the second attempt by the Petitioner to have me removed from 
the home, which ultimately succeeded.  
2. The claims within this suit mentioned sexually aggressive comments and 
threatening behavior. These allegations are materially false, as the Petitioner 
possesses no evidence, and has presented no evidence in relation to these claims 
since the initiation of the suit. Despite this, as video and image evidence will show 
once a fair trial date is set, the Petitioner and I continued to maintain stability at 
our family home and preserved the sense of normalcy that our daughters have 
been accustomed to their entire lives up until January 16th, 2024. 
 
The Court's decision to remove me from my home and my children’s lives on January 
16th, 2024, albeit preliminary and unjustified, bypassed the safeguarding of the children's 
emotional, psychological, and physical well-being. This oversight is compounded by the 
Petitioner's actions. The juxtaposition of the Court's decision against the backdrop of the 
Petitioner's inattention to the children's needs illuminates a disconcerting disregard for the 
paramount principle that custody determinations should primarily serve the children's best 
interests. The final section of this motion will highlight the procedural aspects of the events 
unfolding between the dates of January 16th, 2024, and February 1st, 2024, and pray the court 
will rectify this situation by restoring the stability to our family by vacating the current 
temporary orders that are in place until a proper investigation can be completed by the courts.

THE PROTECTIVE ORDER HEARINGS 
1. In preparation for the Protective Order hearing on January 16th, 2024, I filed with the 
Court an answer to the Protective Order on January 2nd, 2024 as well as two motions – a 
motion to consolidate the divorce with the protective order, filed on January 4th, 2024, as 
well as a motion of continuance, filed on January 8th, 2024 for the purpose to acquire 
counsel due to the complex nature of the case.¹ All three filings were accepted by the 
court.  
 
2. On January 16th, 2024, both parties sought additional time to secure legal 
representation. Despite not reviewing any evidence, witness testimonies, or documents 
related to the motions, and acknowledging the denial of a previous Emergency Protective 
Order, the court mandated my departure from our home within four hours. This 
decision, unexpectedly made, awarded custody to the Petitioner, overlooking my 
concerns about the adverse effects on our children and my work from home. This ruling, 
which both parties did not sign, set the case to resume on January 22nd, 2024, to allow 
time for obtaining counsel.² 
 
3. Following the court's directive, I relocated to my father's residence in Flower Mound until 
the subsequent hearing. During this interval, the Petitioner did not take the initiative to 
have the children call once and did not provide any information as to how they were 
doing, showcasing her lack of empathy and concern for our children’s well-being and 
stability. After incurring substantial expenses to secure representation, I detailed my case 
and concerns to my attorney, preparing for the next court appearance. 
 
4. On January 22nd, 2024, the Petitioner chose to seek legal representation just minutes 
before the hearing was due to start, indicating a disregard for the process. My lawyer 
recommended agreeing to a continuance, thereby extending the period I couldn't work 
and impacting our established family dynamics. This resulted in a third hearing being set 
for February 1st, coinciding with my birthday, and a second rendition being ordered.³

5. On February 1st, 2024, during the third hearing, the substantive issues I had raised were 
not addressed, nor was there any exchange of evidence between our legal representatives. 
Despite the focus of the hearing supposed to be on the protective order, the discussions 
veered into custody and child support matters. My lawyer presented the sole option of a 
temporary return to the family home for 30 days with expanded visitation rights, coupled 
with a child support obligation starting in April. This outcome, which diverged significantly 
from the case's core issues, compelled me to reconsider my legal representation. 
Consequently, I decided to terminate my attorney's services and embarked on drafting this 
motion myself, aiming to bring the court's attention back to the pivotal elements of the case 
that had thus far been neglected while able to legally reside in my home. 
 
CONCLUSION AND PRAYER 
In conclusion, this motion has laid bare the stark realities and procedural aberrations that have 
marred the essence of justice and due process in the matter of Cause No. 322-744263-23. 
Through the course of these proceedings, it has become abundantly clear that the actions taken 
by the Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, have not only disregarded the welfare and best 
interests of our children but have also illuminated her unfitness as a parent. Her actions speak 
to a pattern of deceit, manipulation, and an unsettling willingness to leverage the judicial 
system for personal vendettas, all at the expense of the emotional and psychological well-being 
of our children. 
 
The court, in its decisions, inadvertently facilitated this troubling trajectory by removing me, 
Charles Dustin Myers, from the lives of our children based on unsubstantiated claims and 
without due consideration of my role as a devoted and stable parent. This oversight has not 
only disrupted the lives of our children but has also significantly impaired my ability to provide 
for them, casting a long shadow over their future stability and welfare. 
 
Moreover, the conduct of my Counsel involved has further compounded these issues, 
demonstrating a distressing disregard for the intricate dynamics and facts of this case. This has 
culminated in a situation where the paramount importance of the children's best interests and 
the fundamental principles of fairness and justice have been overshadowed by procedural 
missteps and a lack of thorough investigation into the Petitioner's fitness as a parent.

Therefore, it is with a heavy hearted yet unwavering resolve that I implore the Court to take 
immediate and decisive action to rectify these wrongs. Specifically, I respectfully request the 
Court to: 
1. Vacate the existing temporary orders that unjustly removed me from my home and 
separated me from my children, restoring the status quo ante until a thorough and 
unbiased evaluation of the facts can be conducted, as the Texas Constitution requires. If 
left as it stands, these orders will further compound the issues at hand, and will 
exacerbate the chaos introduced into the children’s lives. 
2. Set a fair hearing date to delve into the substantive issues at hand, ensuring that all 
parties are given an equitable opportunity to present their case and that the best 
interests of our children are placed at the forefront of all considerations. 
3. Scrutinize any response or new claims from the Petitioner or her counsel with the utmost 
diligence, given the established pattern of deceitful and manipulative behavior exhibited 
by the Petitioner throughout these proceedings. 
4. Consider awarding me full custody of our children, ensuring their continued access to a 
stable, nurturing environment, and the consistent provision of their needs, which I am 
fully committed to upholding. Furthermore, in alignment with my enduring belief in the 
importance of both parents in the lives of our children, I pledge to facilitate and 
encourage a healthy, constructive relationship between the children and their mother, 
provided she demonstrates a genuine commitment to their well-being and stability. 
5. In seeking these remedies, I do so not out of vindictiveness but from a place of deep 
concern for the welfare of our children and a steadfast belief in the principles of justice 
and fairness. Despite the pain and turmoil of these proceedings, my ultimate desire is for 
peace and the best possible outcome for all parties involved, most importantly, our 
children. It is my sincere hope that the Court will recognize the gravity of the situation 
and act in a manner that prioritizes the well-being of our children, ensuring their return 
to a life marked by stability and love. 
 
I affirm under penalty of perjury that all claims herein are true and accurate to the best of my 
knowledge. 
Respectfully submitted on this 9th day of February 2024,

IN THE 322nd DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY 
STATE OF TEXAS 
Morgan Michelle Myers, 
Cause No. 322-744263-23 
Petitioner, 
v. 
RESPONDENT’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL 
SUMMARY JUDGEMENT 
Charles Dustin Myers, 
Respondent 
Pursuant to Rule 166a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure¹, the Respondent, Charles 
Dustin Myers, firmly seeks a partial Summary Judgment in regard to the upcoming 
hearing scheduled for March 14th, 2024. He categorically asserts that the evidence on file 
with the Court definitively demonstrates there is no genuine issue as to any material fact 
related to the allegations against him which have led to his unwarranted removal from 
his home, significantly disrupted his business operations, and unjustly granted the 
Petitioner full custody of their children and possession of the family home on a 
temporary basis. 
The Respondent has meticulously and persistently contested the baseless allegations of 
family violence that have unjustly prejudiced the custody resolution to the detriment of 
the children's interests. The absence of substantive evidence supporting these claims has 
been made clear through detailed submissions.²  This unwarranted influence on custody 
¹ Rule 166a specifically allows for summary judgment when "the pleadings, depositions, answers to 
interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine

IN THE 322™ DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY
STATE OF TEXAS
Morgan Michelle Myers, Cause No. 322-744263-23

Petitioner,

RESPONDENT’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL

SUMMARY JUDGEMENT
Charles Dustin Myers,

Respondent

Pursuant to Rule 166a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure!, the Respondent, Charles
Dustin Myers, firmly seeks a partial Summary Judgment in regard to the upcoming
hearing scheduled for March 14", 2024. He categorically asserts that the evidence on file
with the Court definitively demonstrates there is no genuine issue as to any material fact
related to the allegations against him which have led to his unwarranted removal from
his home, significantly disrupted his business operations, and unjustly granted the

Petitioner full custody of their children and possession of the family home on a
temporary basis.

The Respondent has meticulously and persistently contested the baseless allegations of

family violence that have unjustly prejudiced the custody resolution to the detriment of
the children's interests. The absence of substantive evidence supporting these claims has
been made clear through detailed submissions.2 This unwarranted influence on custody

1 Rule 166a specifically allows for summary judgment when "the pleadings, depositions, answers to
interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine
issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." This
provision is utilized here to highlight the lack of factual dispute regarding the allegations of family
violence which have led to the continuation of unlawful temporary orders currently in place.

2 Submissions on record filed by the Respondent: Motion of Continuance (granted), Motion of
Consolidation (granted), Protective Order Answer (ignored), Counter Petition for Divorce (ignored),
Motion of Withdrawal for Attorney (granted), Emergency Motion of Reconsideration of Evidence and to
Vacate Temporary Orders (Scheduled for March 14", 2024). See attached EXHIBIT A.

arrangements negate the principles of fairness and due process. The subsequent 
dismissal of the Protective Order suit not only vindicates the Respondent but also 
invalidates the current custody orders, revealing that the initial award of custody was 
grounded solely in unsubstantiated claims of family violence.³ 
 
BACKGROUND 
The documents on record filed by the Respondent, by virtue of their acceptance, 
inherently meet the threshold for self-authentication, thereby bolstering the legal 
foundation for the requested partial Summary Judgment. Detailed herewith are the 
enumerated facts underpinning this motion: 
1. On December 14th, 2023, the Petitioner sought an EX-PARTE Order of 
Protection from the Court, which was judiciously denied, affirming the 
absence of immediate threat or harm that warranted such an extraordinary 
measure. Undeterred by this judicial determination, the Petitioner proceeded 
to file for divorce on December 18th, 2023, misleadingly alleging the existence 
of an active Order of Protection against the Respondent. This deliberate 
misrepresentation constitutes not merely an attempt to skew the legal process 
in the Petitioner’s favor but represents a flagrant abuse of the judicial system 
designed to secure an undue advantage in the divorce proceedings, which has 
ultimately been successful. 
 
2. On December 22nd, 2023, the Petitioner initiated a subsequent application for 
a Protective Order, forming the cornerstone of litigation since the initial 
hearing on January 16th, 2024.  
 
3. On January 16th, 2024, the Court rendered Temporary Orders which required 
the Respondent to vacate his family home and give up custody of his children 
on the presumption of family violence. The Court’s decision did not meet the 
statutory requirements of the Texas Family Code, Sec. 6.502.⁴ 
 
³ The non-suit of the protective order entitles the Respondent to this Partial Summary Judgement as a 
matter of law, as there is now no genuine dispute over the baselessness of the allegations made against 
him which are the foundation of the current temporary orders in place. 
⁴ Sec. 6.502 mandates that a Court may make such a decision while a suit for dissolution of a marriage is 
pending and on the motion of a party or on the court's own motion after notice and hearing. No hearing 
took place, and no reasonable notice was given prior to the decision rendered on January 16th, 2024.

4. On January 22nd, 2024, before the start of the reset hearing, the Petitioner   
acquired legal counsel at the last minute, delaying the case further until the 
reset date of February 1st, 2024. 
 
5. On February 1st, 2024, both parties entered into an agreement which allowed 
the respondent back into the home on a temporary basis, yet still awarded the 
Petitioner with full custody of the children. The Respondent was given 30 days 
per the agreement to remain in the home. Despite having the ability to stay 
next door, and after dropping the Protective Suit that initiated and are the 
foundation for this agreement, the Petitioner chose to stay with her friend 9 
miles away and remove the children from their stable environment. 
 
6. On February 5th, 2024, the Respondent discharged his Legal Counsel for failure 
to address any of the issues mentioned herewith, and for failure to diligently 
represent the Respondent, as no genuine effort was made to make the court 
aware of these errors. The Protective Order suit was non-suited on this day, 
invalidating the current agreement, and requiring by law that the Court reset 
the case back to the status quo ante until a fair discovery process can be 
conducted on relevant matters to the divorce proceeding, and restoring order 
back into the lives of the Respondent and his Children. 
 
7. The Petitioner's decision to reside outside the family home, despite alternatives 
that would minimize disruption during this transitional period, is a deliberate 
choice. This choice, made independently, should not facilitate the continuation 
of unfounded claims that have since been dismissed. Such actions have unduly 
influenced the living arrangements and well-being of the children at the heart 
of this case. 
 
8. The Respondent explicitly refrains from pursuing any sanctions or penalties 
against the Petitioner, emphasizing instead a heartfelt plea for a reasonable 
transition period. This adjustment period is advocated as crucial for 
safeguarding the welfare of his children, himself, and the Petitioner, ensuring 
their collective long-term well-being. Furthermore, the Respondent 
underscores that the prevailing custody determinations were unjustly 
predicated on unsubstantiated allegations of family violence—a point 
underscored by the unequivocal dismissal of the Protective Order, which 
confirms the absence of any contested material facts.

LEGAL BASIS 
The legal foundation for this Partial Summary Judgment is firmly rooted in the principles 
and mandates of the law, notably where the current temporary orders are predicated on 
unsubstantiated claims of family violence, for which no concrete evidence has been 
presented. This lack of evidence fundamentally challenges the integrity and validity of 
the orders affecting the lives and welfare of the children involved. The necessity for the 
court to vacate these orders and revert to the status quo ante is underscored by the 
following critical legal arguments: 
1 . Misalignment with Texas Family Code Sec. 105.001:  
 
1.1 The orders issued on January 16th, 2024, and continued on January 
22nd, 2024, starkly conflict with Texas Family Code Sec. 105.001, which 
unequivocally necessitates notice and a hearing prior to the issuance of 
such orders. This statute ensures that parties are given a fair opportunity to 
be heard, a fundamental aspect of due process, which was conspicuously 
absent in this case. 
 
2. Contravention of Texas Family Code Sec. 105.005:  
2.1 The initial rendering of temporary orders on January 16th, 2024, did 
not adhere to Texas Family Code Sec. 105.005, requiring that court's 
findings be grounded in a preponderance of the evidence before making 
any child custody determination affecting the parent-child relationship.  
 
2.2 The absence of evidence from the Petitioner, juxtaposed with the 
disregard for the Respondent's timely submissions, underscores a 
significant deviation from this legal requirement. 
 
3. Violation of Texas Family Code Sec. 153.002:  
 
3.1 The proceedings failed to prioritize "The best interest of the child," as 
mandated by Texas Family Code Sec. 153.002. This principle, deemed 
paramount in determining issues of conservatorship, possession, and 
access, was overlooked.

lives were disregarded, further exacerbating the impact of the Petitioner’s 
actions and the court’s decisions on the children’s stability and well-being. 
4. Equal Opportunity and Fair Hearing (Sec. 152.205 & Sec. 105.003): 
4.1 The Texas Family Code Sec. 152.205 and Sec. 105.003 enshrine the 
necessity for equitable procedural rights, mandating that all parties are 
granted a fair opportunity for notification and a meaningful hearing. The 
Respondent’s ability to engage fully in the hearing process and to present a 
comprehensive defense was significantly impeded, a deviation from the 
due process envisaged by these statutes. Consequently, the temporary 
orders issued lack the foundational fairness that is central to the justice 
system and contravene the legal safeguards intended to ensure balanced 
participation by all parties in family law proceedings. 
 
5. Managing Conservatorship Considerations (Sec. 153.005 & Sec. 153.007): 
5.1 In deliberations of conservatorship, Texas Family Code Sec. 153.005 
obligates the court to deliberate thoroughly on the child’s best interest, 
including the living circumstances and stability provided by the parents. 
Additionally, Sec. 153.007 advocates for the establishment of a mutually 
agreed parenting plan, prioritizing the child’s welfare and the continuity of 
their established routine. The current custodial provisions do not 
correspond with a collaboratively designed parenting plan that satisfies 
these essential criteria. Given the disproven allegations of family violence 
and the unnecessary protective measures imposed during this period of 
change, it is imperative for the Court to rescind these provisional measures. 
The immediate restoration of the status quo ante is crucial to uphold the 
children’s best interest, allowing for a planned and considerate period of 
adjustment that acknowledges the absence of any immediate risk or harm 
to their well-being and without disruption to the Respondent’s business 
operations at-home.

fairness and efficiency of the legal process, particularly in this case where 
the Respondent, has faced significant challenges and disruptions based on 
temporary orders and allegations without the foundation of substantiated 
evidence or the proper procedural disclosures as outlined by Rule 4.02. The 
absence of such critical documentation and summaries from the Petitioner 
has not only impaired the Respondent's ability to prepare and present a 
comprehensive defense but has also deprived the Court of essential 
information necessary for a fair and informed decision-making process. 
 
7. Rule 60. Relief from a Judgment or Order (Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure): 
7.1 In accordance with Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 
this motion seeks relief from the temporary orders previously granted, and 
which are the basis of the current orders, which have unjustifiably removed 
the Respondent from his residence and disrupted his custodial rights 
without substantial evidence. Rule 60(b) expressly allows for such relief 
under conditions including, but not limited to, mistake, inadvertence, 
surprise, excusable neglect, and most pertinently, fraud or 
misrepresentation by an opposing party. Given the demonstrated lack of 
evidence supporting the allegations of family violence and the procedural 
discrepancies noted throughout the initiation and execution of these 
temporary orders, it is imperative that the court immediately vacate the 
current arrangements as their basis no longer exists. The circumstances 
surrounding the issuance of these orders align with the instances wherein 
Rule 60(b) provides clear recourse for relief, underscoring the necessity for 
their immediate reevaluation to restore fairness and ensure justice is served

STATEMENTS OF FACT 
Below are the enumerated statements of fact with no genuine dispute of material fact 
that entitle the Respondent to this Partial Summary Judgement: 
1. The Petitioner has not provided any evidence of Family Violence.⁶ These claims 
unjustly removed the Respondent from his home starting on January 16th, 2024 
and significantly impaired his at-home business operations, and are the basis for 
the current custodial arrangements which are unlawful and founded on false 
claims.⁷ 
 
2. No basis exists for the current arrangements, as the Court has not considered the 
best interests of the children throughout this case, but rather has operated solely 
on the accusations of family violence, which are now non-suited.⁸ 
 
3. The deadline approaching March 1st to vacate, and the current custodial 
arrangements are void of any lawful basis. Any custodial arrangements are 
required to consider the best interests of the children involved. 
 
4. Respondent’s parenting plan has been overlooked by the Court, filed January 6th, 
2024.⁹ 
 
5. The Court’s basis for conservatorship was based solely on the claims of Family 
Violence, which are now void. 
 
6. The respondent is entitled to this Partial Summary Judgement as a matter of law, 
which will rightfully restore the status quo ante given no genuine dispute of 
material fact exists regarding family violence, which are the basis for the ongoing 
and current orders.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF 
WHEREFORE, Charles Dustin Myers, the Respondent herein, respectfully requests this 
Honorable Court to: 
1. Annul the current temporary custody and visitation arrangements premised on 
allegations now proven to be baseless, taking into account the critical urgency 
imposed by the Respondent’s work-from-home requirements and the ongoing 
detriment to his familial relationships. 
 
2. Recognize that the initial accusations of family violence, which underpinned 
the imposition of these temporary measures, were not substantiated by 
credible evidence. This failure has unjustly prejudiced the Respondent, 
undermining his right to an equitable adjudication and rendering the imposed 
measures legally untenable. 
 
 
3. Acknowledge the absence of substantial evidence for the allegations levied 
against the Respondent. Command a thorough reevaluation of both procedural 
and substantive legal missteps observed in the prevailing proceedings, with a 
view to rectifying the inequitable temporary orders that have adversely 
impacted the Respondent’s familial and professional life. 
 
4.  In accordance with Rule 166a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule 
60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, award relief predicated on 
identifiable mistakes, errors, and the conspicuous lack of evidential foundation 
for the accusations faced by the Respondent. 
 
 
5. Uphold Fairness and Due Process: Reorient the ongoing legal process to align 
strictly with the principles of fairness, due process, and the paramount 
interests of the children involved. This reorientation is essential to ensure the 
administration of justice, uphold the Respondent’s inalienable right to a fair 
trial, and ameliorate the unwarranted disruptions to his familial life. 
 
6. Consideration of Respondent’s Efforts: Reflect on the substantial time and 
effort dedicated by the Respondent in pursuit of equitable treatment under the
