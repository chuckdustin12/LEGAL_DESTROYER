TO THE HONORABLE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS: 
The Relator, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, respectfully submits this Second  
Amended Motion to Consolidate, and in support of the motion, would show this Court the 
following: 
I. Introduction
Within the last 23 days, four mandamus petitions have been docketed involving the 
same parties but identify distinct legal errors made by the trial courts below. In sum, the 
respondents include two Associate Judges, a District Judge, and a Regional Presiding 
Judge currently presiding over recusal proceedings. Each of the Respondents, the Real 
Party, her counsel, and the Office of the Attorney General were duly notified of all 
intentions to initiate these actions, the relief sought, and to date no input has been 
provided. 
The legal errors identified are significant and multifaceted: (1) an issuance of a 
void order by rendering a consent judgment where consent was lacking and in excess 
statutory authority; (2) a refusal to hear a properly filed emergency Temporary 
Restraining Order (TRO); (3) a swift and improper consolidation of cases without a 
hearing; and (4) a failure to adhere to Rule 18a regarding recusal proceedings. These 
actions have not only violated procedural norms but have also exacerbated the legal and 
personal hardships faced by the petitioner, and consolidation would serve the interest of 
judicial efficiency in providing a more wholistic view of these issues.

TO THE HONORABLE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS:

The Relator, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, respectfully submits this Second

Amended Motion to Consolidate, and in support of the motion, would show this Court the

Amended Statement of Facts 
 
Relator, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, is referred to herein as “Father.” 
Real Party in Interest, MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS, is referred to herein at 
“Mother”. Each record citation marked with (R. X-X) is referencing the 
concurrently filed Amended Consolidated Mandamus Record. 
 
A. The Precipitating Event and Background Facts 
 
The events giving rise to these proceedings began on December 12, 2023, 
when the father discovered a series of text message exchanges between the mother 
and two individuals outside the marriage—identified in the record as Damen 
Kazlauskas and Debbie Price (R. 253–711). This discovery occurred shortly after 
the mother’s abrupt announcement of her intent to divorce and raised concerns 
regarding the children’s well-being and emotional environment. In an effort to 
address the matter constructively, the father contacted the mother’s grandfather— 
who resides next door to the marital home—via text message to request a family 
meeting to discuss the situation (R. 717–720). 
The following day, however, when Father confronted Mother with the 
discovery—presenting his concerns in the form of data visualizations (R. 255– 
257)—she began distancing herself, starting by redirecting the planned family 
conversation into a private meeting solely between herself and her grandparents (R. 
1716). On December 14, 2023, Mother initiated text communication with her

stepfather, Dan Branthoover, who resides in Yukon, Oklahoma (R. 274–278). Mr. 
Branthoover then contacted Father via text message, stating that he wanted to help 
both parties and requested a phone conversation (R. 1703). That conversation 
resulted in an arrangement for Mother to travel to Mr. Branthoover’s residence over 
the weekend beginning December 15, 2023, where Mr. Branthoover later 
acknowledged that he would be assisting with the divorce paperwork (R. 1710). 
During this same period, Mother also sought an ex parte emergency protective 
order against Father from the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County, as referenced 
in her divorce petition (R. 78 at 9B). 
B. Travel, Influence and Conversion of Marital Assets 
 
While en route to, or upon arrival at, Mr. Branthoover’s residence, Mother 
withdrew the entirety of the funds from the joint marital bank account, totaling 
$1,576 (R. 723; 1716–1717). The transaction was facilitated by Mr. Branthoover, 
who used his PayPal account—identified as “dmb575” (R. 1707)—as an 
intermediary to transfer the funds. This identifier corresponds to the relevant 
December 2023 bank statement (R. 1706). Both Mr. Branthoover and Mother later 
admitted that the transaction had occurred (R. 1709, 1716). 
As a result, on December 16, 2023, Father was notified that the joint account 
had been overdrawn, which caused the suspension of his business’s advertising 
services due to a failed payment (R. 726–727). Father subsequently contacted Mr.

Branthoover in writing to request the return of the funds, explaining that the money 
was needed to cover essential family expenses and to purchase Christmas presents 
for the children (R. 728–729). During this exchange, Mr. Branthoover explicitly 
informed Father that Mother’s visit was for the purpose of receiving assistance 
with the preparation of divorce paperwork (R. 730). 
C. The Eviction 
 
The situation escalated further on December 17, 2023, when Father was 
served with an eviction notice by Mother’s grandmother, Margie Wilson. The 
notice cited a protective order and a divorce petition as the basis for eviction, 
despite those documents not having been formally filed at the time (R. 735). The 
case was later heard by the Honorable Judge Swearingin Jr. and was dismissed for 
lack of subject matter jurisdiction (R. 736–737) on January 17, 2024. 
D. The Divorce Petition 
 
On December 18, 2023, Mother formally filed for divorce (R. 71–81) and 
requested an “Uncontested Cases” form from the court (R. 101). In her divorce 
petition, she claimed that the parties had stopped living together as spouses on or 
around December 1, 2023 (R. 74 at 4). She also asserted financial indigence, 
stating that she had only $21 in her bank account (R. 91) while being responsible 
for $1,610 in monthly expenses (R. 92). Contradicting the timeline established by 
the eviction notice served the previous day, the petition further alleged that an

active protective order was already in place against Father, and that a finding of 
family violence had been made during the marriage—thereby waiving the 
statutory 60-day waiting period (R. 78 at 10). 
Mother further claimed that the marital property would be divided by 
agreement yet designated both family vehicles as her separate property (R. 79). 
She requested joint managing conservatorship (R. 75 at 6D) and sought standard 
visitation rights for Father (R. 76 at 6F), while simultaneously alleging that she 
and the children could face abuse or serious harm if Father were provided with her 
contact information (R. 81 at 15). 
E. The Protective Order 
Four days after filing for divorce, on December 22, 2023, Mother filed an 
application for a protective order (R. 103–109). In supporting documents, 
including an affidavit (R. 108) and an unsworn declaration, she alleged that family 
violence occurred on December 18, 2023—the same day she filed for divorce (R. 
109). 
However, evidence indicates that on that same day, Mother was present at the 
family home with Father, exhibiting no signs of being in a state of emergency (R. 
1692). Mother continued to cohabit with Father intermittently following these 
filings, as evidenced by her presence at the family home on December 29, 2023, 
participating in a typical evening with Father and the children (R. 1716). Father

was formally served with the protective order suit on December 27, 2023 (R. 117-
118). 
Within the protective order application, Mother requested that Father be 
prohibited from approaching within 200 feet of the children’s school, that he cease 
all communication with her, and that he complete a battering intervention and 
prevention program (R. 105). She acknowledged the joint ownership of the 
matrimonial residence but nonetheless requested spousal support, child support, 
and Father’s immediate removal from the home (R. 106). Adding another layer to 
the situation, the day after the divorce was filed—on December 19, 2023—Mr. 
Branthoover contacted Father via text message, claiming to represent Mother in the 
legal proceedings (R. 1712). Despite these filings and allegations, Father continued 
to cohabit with Mother leading up to the first scheduled legal proceeding: a show 
cause hearing set for January 16, 2024. During this interim period, Father 
prioritized the children and spent time with them during their holiday break (R. 
826–829). 
F. Father Prepares His Defense 
 
In response to the series of legal actions initiated by Mother, Father waited 
until after the children’s Christmas holiday to formally begin preparing his defense. 
He first filed an original answer to the protective order application, denying all 
allegations of family violence (R. 129–133). In his answer, Father raised the

affirmative defenses of fraud, illegality, and duress, asserting that Mother was 
attempting to misuse the legal process (R. 131). To support his position, Father 
attached two exhibits: the first was a copy of his Texas Department of Public 
Safety (TxDPS) record, demonstrating no history of violence (R. 134–136); the 
second highlighted inconsistencies within Mother’s divorce petition (R. 137–140). 
Subsequently, on January 3, 2024, Father filed a motion to consolidate the 
protective order proceedings with the divorce case (R. 142–145). He also 
submitted a background report intended to provide the court with context regarding 
the children’s familial circumstances (R. 146–148). Father later filed a motion for 
continuance to obtain legal representation (R. 149–151), accompanied by 
additional documentation related to the family situation (R. 152–155), including 
text message evidence from Mr. Branthoover intended to refute Mother’s claim of 
indigency (R. 161–164). Finally, on January 13, 2024, Father submitted an 
unsworn declaration detailing the sequence of events leading up to that point (R.

Father to vacate the family residence effective immediately—without conducting 
an evidentiary hearing, making specific findings, or considering Father’s 
submitted pleadings. This resulted in a de facto temporary termination of Father’s 
custodial rights, and the case was reset for January 22, 2024, to be heard by the 
Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer (R. 182–185). 
Faced with the sudden loss of his residence and access to his children, Father 
sought legal representation immediately and retained attorney Daniel R. Bacalis on 
January 19, 2024—just three days before the rescheduled hearing (R. 818 at 9). 
Father promptly briefed Mr. Bacalis on the situation, providing insights into the 
family dynamics through a comprehensive statement of context (R. 168–174). 
H. Reset #1 – Show Cause 
 
On the rescheduled date of January 22, 2024, the parties appeared at the 
courthouse for the second setting. Mother initially appeared without legal counsel 
but retained attorney Cooper L. Carter in the courthouse lobby just prior to the 
hearing. This prompted a further delay, as the Honorable Judge Kaitcer granted a 
continuance sua sponte, resetting the case once more to February 1, 2024 (R. 185– 
187). 
In the period between settings, both Mr. Bacalis, representing Father, and 
Mr. Carter, representing Mother, filed amended pleadings in the divorce 
proceedings (R. 188-207, R. 208-219).

At the third scheduled setting on February 1, 2024, both parties arrived 
with their respective counsel and announced they were ready to proceed.1 
However, instead of the matter being heard by Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer, father’s 
counsel, Mr. Bacalis, drafted an “Agreed Associate Judge’s Report” which was 
presented to father in the hallway outside the courtroom. (R. 228-234). This 
proposed agreement included terms to non-suit (dismiss) the protective order 
application, grant father residency in the family home only until March 1, 2024, 
and outline the division of financial responsibilities (R. 231-232). 
Father expressed significant reservations and initially refused to sign the 
agreed order, stating his desire to proceed to trial to address mother's allegations 
directly and hold her accountable, where he was told by his counsel, “I know the 
judge, this is the best we can get,” and felt pressured into signing the agreement as 
the only presented option, which is corroborated by father’s witness in an 
affidavit (R. 1367-1369). Feeling frustrated by this outcome, father paid 
particular attention to the procedural requirements highlighted in bold text within 
the agreement signed on February 1, 2024 (R. 233). The Father then realized that 
if he terminated his attorney, he wouldn’t be able to prepare the written order and 
made the decision to terminate his counsel and represent himself moving forward.

Shortly after the court setting, Father terminated the services of his attorney, 
Dan Bacalis, and notified the court (R. 220–222). An agreed motion for withdrawal 
of counsel was subsequently filed (R. 223–227). 
On February 8, 2024, the associate judge’s report dated February 1, 2024, 
was filed into the record (R. 228-234). Around the same time, an agreed order of 
consolidation was entered—consolidating the protective order suit with the divorce 
matter—without Father’s knowledge or signature (R. 235–238). 
In response, Father prepared an Emergency Motion to Vacate, which he filed 
the following day (R. 239–243). The motion included a supporting brief 
summarizing the procedural history and outlining what Father described as 
Mother’s unlawful campaign against him (R. 244–252), and sought a de novo 
hearing on specific issues. The exhibits accompanying the motion included text 
message evidence and data visualizations involving Mother, Damen Kazlauskas, 
and Debbie Price, originally discovered on December 12, 2023 (R. 253–714); text 
messages between Father and Mother’s grandfather indicating the divorce was 
unexpected (R. 715-720); evidence of marital asset conversion between Mother 
and Daniel Branthoover (R. 721–723); documentation of the overdrawn joint bank 
account and related communications from Branthoover (R. 724–731); a copy of 
the eviction notice served by Margie Wilson, which Mother later tore in half and 
marked “VOID” (R. 732-735);

A few days later, the court issued the order granting Attorney Bacalis’s

L. Setting #4 – Emergency Motion to Vacate and Reconsider Evidence 
 
Father appeared for the scheduled hearing on his Emergency Motion (R. 
793).2 Upon entering the courtroom, he was handed a document titled “Temporary 
Orders,” which was a modified version of the February 1, 2024, agreement 
previously prepared by Father’s former counsel (R. 887). These orders were 
prepared by Cooper L. Carter after the 20-day deadline stipulated in the original 
agreement. No agreement had been reached, as evidenced by the parties’ presence 
in court to contest the matter, and no motion to sign had been set or filed—contrary 
to the judge’s prior directive (R. 233) and agreement of the parties. 
The proposed orders also claimed that a hearing had been held on February 
1, 2024, for “Mother’s Motion for Temporary Orders,”3 and that all parties were in 
agreement with the terms “as evidenced by the signatures below” (R. 888). In 
reality, the February 1 setting resulted only in an associate judge’s report, drafted 
informally in the hallway by Father’s prior counsel. Despite this, the proposed 
order stated that the court “heard evidence and argument”—a statement Father 
asserts was inaccurate (R. 888). At that time, the only other scheduled hearing was

explanation, and he was ordered to sign the very agreement he had appeared 
in court to contest (R. 794-795). Notably, the order itself contained two distinct sets 
of handwriting, was prepared by the opposing counsel, and Father refused to sign the 
document because he did not agree to its terms (R. 795). Notably, Father also 
refused to sign the Temporary Orders claiming his consent (R. 925). No order was 
ever issued regarding Father’s Emergency Motion to Vacate. 
Following the setting, Father began exploring his appellate remedies and 
drafted a Preparatory Notice for Judicial Review, which he later amended twice 
(R. 797–846). The document provided a detailed account of the parties’ family 
background (R. 807), employment history, and household dynamics (R. 808–815). 
It included a statement of facts segmented into background facts (R. 816–817), 
procedural facts (R. 817–821), and undisputed evidentiary facts (R. 822–825). The 
pleading also contained video evidence of Father with the children during the 
Mother’s initial campaign to have him removed from the residence (R. 826-829).

mandamus relief by April 8, 2024 (R. 902–905). 
M. The Appellate Proceedings 
In April 2024, Father prepared a Motion for Emergency Relief directed to the 
Second Court of Appeals (R. 979–1007) and a Petition for Writ of Mandamus (R. 
931–978). The Petition was accepted by the appellate court under cause number 02- 
24-00149-CV on April 8, 2024, and the trial court was notified of the filing that same 
day (R. 1009-1010). 
Two days later, Father’s Motion for Emergency Relief and Petition for Writ 
of Mandamus were denied per curiam (R. 1011–1012). Father then submitted a 
Motion for Rehearing on April 18, 2024 (R. 1028–1044). Six days later, on April 24, 
2024, Cooper L. Carter filed a Motion for Pre-Trial Conference (R. 1013–1016), to 
which Father promptly objected (R. 1017–1023). The following day, Father’s 
Motion for Rehearing was denied by the Second Court of Appeals (R. 1045). 
Father moved for en banc reconsideration on April 26, 2024 (R. 1052–1066). 
On April 30, 2024, although Father continued to disagree with the Temporary Orders 
and the hardship they imposed, he abided by the court’s directives and filed a Notice 
of Completion regarding the court-ordered parenting class, which both parties were 
required to complete by May 1, 2024 (R. 1046–1050).5 The en banc reconsideration

motion was denied the following day (R. 1067). 
Father then prepared a second Petition for Writ of Mandamus before this 
Court, which was accepted under cause number 24-0395. The trial court was notified 
of the filing by postcard (R. 1068–1073). 
On May 9, 2024, Cooper L. Carter emailed Father requesting his signature on 
an Income Withholding Order and claimed that the orders were agreed (R. 
1115). Father reviewed the proposed order, determined that it was defective (R. 
1117–1122), and communicated his objections to Ms. Carter (R. 1116). 
N. Intervention From the Texas Attorney General’s Office 
Subsequently, an intervention pleading was filed by the Office of the 
Attorney General, seeking relief from the trial court regarding child support 
obligations (R. 1098–1104). Father objected to this intervention (R. 1105–1113). 
Notably, upon examining the pleading purportedly filed by “Holly Hayes,” Father 
observed that the signature line did not match the name of the listed attorney of 
record. Additionally, the font sizes in the document appeared inconsistent, 
suggesting that the signature may have been irregular (R. 1102). No further 
correspondence was filed by the Attorney General’s Office in this matter. 
By July 2024, during Father’s designated month for visitation under the 
disputed orders, he stayed in an Airbnb near the marital home to maintain stability

business revenue (R. 1736–1746).

On August 30, 2024, this Court declined to hear Father’s mandamus petition, 
and the trial court was notified (R. 1157–1162). Immediately following the denial, 
Father prepared a Motion for Rehearing, which he submitted and later amended in 
mid-September (R. 1135–1156). The court was notified of the rehearing filing (R. 
1163–1168).  
O. Challenge to Opposing Counsel’s Authority Under Rule 12 
 
After filing the Motion for Rehearing with this Court, Father served 
discovery requests on the opposing party, including Requests for Production of 
Documents (R. 1410–1411) and Requests for Admissions (R. 1411–1415). In 
addition, Father filed a motion under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12, 
challenging Cooper L. Carter’s authority to represent Mother in the trial court (R. 
1169–1177). 
This challenge was based on ambiguity surrounding Ms. Carter’s 
employment status and the fact that her pleadings were being filed by Roderick 
D. Marx—an individual who was not listed as counsel of record and not a party 
to the case (R. 219, R. 1016). 
P. Declining Resources and Exhaustion of Remedies 
 
Facing rapidly declining credit, reduced income (R. 1717–1718), and limited 
housing options, Father filed an Emergency Motion for Temporary Orders on

filed a motion seeking the joint recusal of Judge James Munford and Associate 
Judge Jeff Kaitcer. The motion asserted that the nature of Mother’s initial 
allegations had created an appearance of bias that could undermine fairness in the 
proceedings (R. 1196–1220). 
Q. The First Recusal – Procedural Abnormalities 
 
Two days after the recusal motion was filed, Judge James Munford declined 
to recuse himself without explanation and referred the matter to the Honorable 
David L. Evans, the 8th Administrative Regional Judge of Fort Worth (R. 1221– 
1243). Upon reviewing this referral, Father observed that the version of the motion 
submitted to Judge Evans differed significantly from the one he originally filed. 
Father’s original filing was a single, 20.21 MB hyperlinked PDF submitted via the 
re:SearchTX platform (R. 1253-1254). The version transmitted to Judge Evans 
was missing exhibits and the supporting affidavit. Father notified the court 
coordinator of the discrepancy and noted that the file was approximately 18 MB 
smaller (R. 1254–1255). Receiving no response, Father filed a formal notice with 
the court outlining these procedural irregularities (R. 1245–1252). 
The following day, Judge Munford issued an amended order of referral and 
again declined to recuse, without explanation (R. 1281–1283). This time, the 
recusal motion was divided into three separate files, with the court citing the "size 
of the motion" as justification (R. 1356-1357). Father objected to the handling of 
the recusal process (R. 1268–1280), noting that the Tarrant County District

file was well within the platform’s approximately 30 MB capacity and that 
fragmenting the submission contradicted the court’s standard electronic filing 
protocol (R. 1271 at 6–7).

Activity paused until October 18, 2024, when the parties received postcard 
notification that Father’s Supreme Court Motion for Rehearing had been denied 
(R. 1292–1297). Three days later, Judge David L. Evans issued an order setting a 
video conference regarding the recusal motion for October 30, 2024 (R. 1298– 
1301). On the day before the conference, Judge Evans appointed retired Justice 
Lee Gabriel to preside over the recusal matter (R. 1305–1308). 
During the scheduled video conference, internet connectivity issues arose, 
and the hearing was rescheduled to November 7, 2024, to be held in person at the 
322nd District Court. In anticipation of possible objections from opposing 
counsel—who had not filed a response to the recusal motion—Father filed a Pre- 
Trial Motion in Limine to prevent unnecessary interruptions during his 
presentation and to reiterate key facts of the case (R. 1309-1315). 
Two days later, Father submitted a Request for Confirmation of Procedural 
Requirements, respectfully asking the district clerk to provide a certified copy of

video conference regarding the recusal motion for October 30, 2024 (R. 1298—
1301). On the day before the conference, Judge Evans appointed retired Justice
Lee Gabriel to preside over the recusal matter (R. 1305-1308).

During the scheduled video conference, internet connectivity issues arose,
and the hearing was rescheduled to November 7, 2024, to be held in person at the
322nd District Court. In anticipation of possible objections from opposing
counsel—who had not filed a response to the recusal motion—Father filed a Pre-
Trial Motion in Limine to prevent unnecessary interruptions during his
presentation and to reiterate key facts of the case (R. 1309-1315).

Two days later, Father submitted a Request for Confirmation of Procedural

Requirements, respectfully asking the district clerk to provide a certified copy of

Justice Gabriel’s oath of office, in an effort to ensure procedural transparency (R. 
1319–1324). 
S. The First Recusal – Dental Emergency 
 
On the morning of the rescheduled in-person hearing, November 7, 2024, 
Father awoke experiencing significant dental distress, which he promptly 
communicated to his father (R. 1391–1392), opposing counsel and the court 
coordinator via email (R. 1394), and to Mother directly (R. 1395). Opposing 
counsel agreed in writing to reschedule the hearing due to the emergency (R. 
1393). 
Nonetheless, four days later, on November 11, 2024, the court coordinator 
disseminated via email an order signed by Justice Gabriel denying Father’s recusal 
motion. The order specifically referenced Father’s absence from the November 7 
hearing but made no mention of the dental emergency (R. 1397). In response, 
Father filed a Motion to Enter Judgment on November 13, 2024, in which he 
articulated objections to the procedural irregularities surrounding the recusal 
proceedings (R. 1325–1369). This motion was supported by an affidavit 
elaborating upon those irregularities (R. 1346–1349). 
Shortly thereafter, Father filed a Notice of Intent to Remove the case to 
federal court, citing exhaustion of state judicial remedies and setting forth 
jurisdictional grounds for removal to the U.S. District Court for the Northern 
District of Texas (R. 1371–1397).

On November 18, 2024, Father also submitted a Motion to Compel 
Discovery (R. 1398–1407) pertaining to discovery requests initially served on 
Mother on September 17, 2024, attached as Exhibit A (R. 1408–1418). He 
requested that the court deem the requested admissions conclusively established by 
operation of law due to Mother’s failure to respond (R. 1405). 
The recusal proceedings concluded when the court formally documented and 
served the order denying Father’s recusal motion on November 19, 2024 (R. 1422– 
1423). At that point, the parties awaited formal confirmation of the termination of 
Justice Lee Gabriel’s assignment, as such termination would not effectuate “…until 
the undersigned Presiding Judge has terminated this assignment in writing.” (R. 
1306.) 
 
T. Federal Removal, Remand, and Initiation of Proceedings Against Daniel 
Kenneth Branthoover 
Following the denial of the recusal motion, Father spent the next two weeks 
compiling the necessary record in preparation for federal removal. On December 2, 
2024, he filed a Notice of Removal with the state trial court (R. 1425–1444). Two 
days later, however, the United States District Court remanded the matter back to 
state court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.6 
On December 14, 2024, Dan Branthoover sent Father a threatening text

message (R. 1719–1720). At that point, Father’s financial losses had exceeded 
$75,000 (R. 1460–1462), prompting him to initiate separate federal litigation against 
Daniel Branthoover in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma. 
That action sought damages arising from Mr. Branthoover’s involvement in the 
events underlying this case, and was later amended (R. 1450–1464). 
Father provided notice of the related federal case to the state trial court on 
December 31, 2024 (R. 1445–1449). The federal complaint was filed pursuant to 
28 U.S.C. § 1332(a) (R. 1428), and its statement of facts closely mirrored those 
presented in the current matter (R. 1452–1455). 
U. Case Abandonment 
 
The divorce case remained largely inactive until January 16, 2025, when 
Father submitted a comprehensive Case Memorandum and served copies upon 
Judges James Munford and Jeff Kaitcer of the 322nd Judicial District Court, 
Visiting Retired Justice Lee Gabriel, Regional Judge David L. Evans, and opposing 
counsel Cooper L. Carter (R. 1465–1519). On January 26, 2025, Father filed a 
Motion to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution, citing the lack of activity in the case by 
the opposing party and the Court’s time standards for divorce proceedings (R. 
1526–1533). 
 
On January 29, 2025, facing the imminent repossession of his primary

vehicle. Inside, he discovered numerous personal items that Mother had placed in

the vehicle. He temporarily relocated these items to the porch (R. 1628–1629). 
Upon returning the next day to collect the children for his scheduled possession, 
Father observed that Mother had moved the items from the porch to the curb (R. 
1630-1631). 
No further docket activity occurred until February 25, 2025, when Father 
filed a Notice of Loss of Employment, notifying the court of a significant reduction 
in income (R. 1520–1525). At the same time, he submitted a Motion to Sign, 
requesting a ruling on his long-pending Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, 
which had remained unresolved since its original filing on February 22, 2024 (R. 
1636–1656), and which the court acknowledged during the March 14, 2024, 
hearing (R. 1369). Father also filed an Objection and Request for Judicial Notice, 
recapping relevant procedural history and identifying pending matters requiring 
rulings (R. 1660–1677). 
On February 28, 2025, Father filed a Request for Ruling on his outstanding 
motions (R. 1678–1685). On March 5, 2025, he submitted a Notice of New 
Information, documenting Watauga Police Department involvement regarding his 
personal property being placed at the curb by Mother (R. 1686–1695). On March 
12, 2025, Father filed a Notice of Continued Obstruction, itemizing pending,

a Notice of Submission, restating the uncontested factual background and the 
judicial inaction on multiple unresolved filings (R. 1943–1955). 
By March 18, 2025, Father contacted the court coordinator via email, 
highlighting that neither Judge Munford nor Judge Kaitcer had been formally 
reinstated to preside over the case, despite Justice Gabriel’s denial of recusal being 
entered nearly four months earlier (R. 1506-1507). In light of the continued 
judicial inactivity, and being confident in his understanding of dominant 
jurisdiction based on the extensive record, Father initiated a new Original Suit 
Affecting the Parent- Child Relationship (SAPCR) in the 233rd District Court of 
Tarrant County, submitting a cover letter explaining his need for immediate relief 
for himself and his minor children (R. 2259–2277). 
V. The SAPCR Suit and the Sudden Reappearance of Counsel 
On March 18, 2025, the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County accepted 
Father’s original SAPCR petition (R. 2053–2064). Shortly thereafter, Mother 
reappeared in the litigation after several months of inactivity and filed a general 
denial in response to the SAPCR petition (R. 2278–2282). This pleading was 
submitted on behalf of Cooper L. Carter by Roderick D. Marx (R. 2282). Mr. Marx 
subsequently filed a motion to consolidate the SAPCR matter back into the original 
divorce case in the 322nd District Court (R. 2283–2286), again purporting to act 
on Ms. Carter’s behalf (R. 2286).

(R. 1956–1965), and attached an exhibit showing that opposing counsel was 
registered under a different law firm than what appeared on her pleadings. (R. 
1962–1963). Father also filed a second Rule 12 Motion challenging Cooper L. 
Carter’s authority to represent Mother in the 233rd District Court, citing Ms. 
Carter’s continued failure to formally appear and the repeated filings by Mr. Marx 
in her name (R. 2287–2300). As of the date of this filing, no response has been 
submitted to any of these pleadings by Ms. Carter. 
W. The Emergency TRO 
On March 24, 2025, Father filed an Objection to Consolidation in the 
second-filed case (R. 1880–1888) and an Emergency Motion for Temporary 
Restraining Order (TRO), seeking to prevent Mother from restricting his access to 
the family residence and to safeguard the children (R. 2301–2326). The TRO 
incorporated the same statement of facts that remains unopposed in multiple 
pleadings (R. 2304–2312). Father then coordinated with court staff to schedule the 
presentation of his emergency motion and documented all communications (R. 
2333–2365) regarding these interactions. 
 
In those communications, Father first inquired about the status of his request 
and informed the court that the opposing party had been notified of the substance 
of the relief sought (R. 2338). The clerk advised that in-person presentation was 
required, and Father requested to appear between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. on March 28, 
2025, again confirming that the opposing party had been served (R. 2339). Father

delivered the intended materials to opposing counsel in advance of that 
presentation (R. 2351), and the clerk confirmed the scheduled time (R. 2339-
2340). 
On March 28, 2025, Father appeared before the court coordinator, who 
assisted in securing opposing counsel’s agreement to set the TRO hearing for April 
10, 2025, from the available dates provided (R. 2358). The coordinator initialed the 
scheduling notice to reflect that agreement (R. 2360-2361). Father then proceeded 
to present the motion to the Honorable Kate Stone, who summarily declined to 
even hear it based solely on a prospective objection communicated by Mother’s 
counsel—who was not even present in court (R. 2352). Even the coordinator 
acknowledged that the motion could have been heard on the spot, and noted that it 
could have been transferred after the emergency was addressed (R. 2356). Instead, 
the Associate Judge declined entirely to entertain the motion, ultimately triggering 
cause number 25-0367, now pending before this Honorable Court. 
On April 1, 2025, Father filed a Pre-Objection in the 322nd court addressing 
opposing counsel’s anticipated motion to consolidate (R. 1889–1915). He also 
submitted a Respondent’s Statement in the 322nd District Court (R. 1916–1919) 
and a separate Petitioner’s Statement in the 233rd District Court (R. 1920–1928). 
Father then filed a Petitioner’s Notice in the 233rd, presenting a side-by-side 
analysis of the children’s best interests and relevant procedural considerations (R. 
1995–2004).

On April 3, 2025, Roderick Marx filed the Motion to Consolidate on behalf 
of Mother’s counsel that had been used to block the emergency hearing in the 
322nd District Court, which failed to acknowledge Father’s prior objection (R. 
2366–2369). In response, Father filed a Pre-Objection to Transfer in the 233rd 
District Court (R. 2084–2087) realizing that the case would need to be transferred 
at some point along with a Notice of New Information advising the court that 
Mother was now engaged to Damen Kazlauskas—the individual with whom she 
exchanged extensive messages at the outset of this case (R. 2019–2024). Father 
also submitted a Comprehensive Legal Analysis in Support of Dismissal in the 
322nd District Court, setting forth grounds to dismiss the original divorce matter so 
that the SAPCR could proceed independently (R. 1975–1994). 
X. The Dragon in Triplicate 
 
A few days later, Father filed a Notice of Intent to File Mandamus in the 
233rd District Court (R. 2065–2083) and a Notice of Intent to File Prohibition in 
the 322nd District Court (R. 2005–2018). On April 10, 2025, Father filed an 
Emergency Motion for Declaratory Relief (R. 1775–1786) and a Petition for Writ 
of Mandamus in the Second Court of Appeals, naming the Honorable Kate Stone 
as Respondent under cause number 02-25-00164-CV (“the SAPCR Mandamus”) 
(R. 2025–2052). Directly after this mandamus was submitted to the Second Court

with the 322nd District Court. (R. 2392-2395). The following day, the first-filed 
petition (“the SAPCR mandamus”) was denied per curiam in the Second Court of 
Appeals. 
On April 15, 2025, Father filed a Dominant Jurisdiction Analysis in the 
322nd District Court (R. 2088–2100), along with a second memorandum titled 
Procedural Irregularities with Temporary Orders realizing that he was dealing 
with three potential abuses of discretion from three separate judges (R. 2172–

Second Court of Appeals, this time naming the Honorable Jeff Kaitcer as 
Respondent under cause number 02-25-00166-CV (“the Void Order Mandamus”) 
(R. 2396–2447) and filed an Emergency Motion for Stay to halt the proceedings

contested motion without a hearing (R. 2223–2253). On the same day, Father’s 
second mandamus petition was denied per curiam. By April 17, 2025, all three 
mandamus petitions had been denied per curiam, and Father moved for 
reconsideration en banc in all three matters (R. 2448–2467; R. 2203–2217; R.

with the 322" District Court. (R. 2392-2395). The following day, the first-filed
petition (“the SAPCR mandamus”’) was denied per curiam in the Second Court of
Appeals.

On April 15, 2025, Father filed a Dominant Jurisdiction Analysis in the
322nd District Court (R. 2088-2100), along with a second memorandum titled
Procedural Irregularities with Temporary Orders realizing that he was dealing
with three potential abuses of discretion from three separate judges (R. 2172—
2202). That same day, Father filed a second Petition for Writ of Mandamus in the

Second Court of Appeals, this time naming the Honorable Jeff Kaitcer as

Respondent under cause number 02-25-00166-CV (“the Void Order Mandamus’)
(R. 2396-2447) and filed an Emergency Motion for Stay to halt the proceedings
given the extraordinary circumstances of this matter. (R. 2106-2123). See No. 02-
25-00166-CV

The following day, Father filed a third Petition for Writ of Mandamus,
naming the Honorable Kenneth Newell as Respondent under cause number 02-25-
00171-CV (“the Consolidation Mandamus’’) for his arbitrary grant of Mother’s
contested motion without a hearing (R. 2223-2253). On the same day, Father’s

implicated in three distinct abuses of discretion within the same family law matter. 
Y. The Sudden Move to Final Trial 
 
On April 23, 2025, with all three mandamus petitions pending, Father 
received a Notice of Court Proceeding scheduling a conference for April 29, 2025, 
purposed for setting the matter for final trial (R. 1772–1772). That same day, 
Father filed a formal objection to the setting (R. 2218–2222). The following day, 
Father’s first filed en banc motion for reconsideration (the “Void Order” 
mandamus) was denied per curiam by the appellate court. 
To address the unresolved issues regarding subject-matter jurisdiction over 
these orders, Father filed a Plea to the Jurisdiction asking the Honorable James 
Munford to clarify the legal basis for the current orders (R. 2468–2479). In a 
further effort to protect his procedural rights, Father filed a Second Motion to 
Recuse Judge Munford on April 25, 2025 (R. 1787–1859). Later that same day, 
Mother notified Father that the emergency circumstance which had formed the 
original basis for Father’s urgent push for the Emergency TRO petition had now 
materialized (R. 1766–1771). 
With this new development, Father filed a Notice of Non-Appearance and 
Objection to Trial Setting (R. 2480–2486) and amended his pending Motion to 
Recuse (R. 2487–2608). Despite the allegations and the procedural defects raised, 
Judge Munford declined to recuse himself for a second time without any 
substantive explanation (R. 2609–2613).

Separately, the Honorable Jeff Kaitcer—though not named in the recusal 
motion—filed a voluntary recusal from the case (R. 2614–2618). In response, 
Father filed an Objection to Procedural Handling of the Recusal Proceedings, 
explaining that Judge Kaitcer’s referral order was improper and specifically 
objected to the court coordinator managing the recusal process (R. 2619–2625). 
On May 1, 2025, the appellate court denied Father’s two remaining en banc 
motions per curiam (R. 2626-2627; 2628-2629). That same day, Father filed his 
second Petition for Writ of Mandamus before this Court under cause number 25- 
 
0361.7 He filed a third petition the next day, May 2, 2025, under cause number 25- 
0367, followed by a fourth on May 7, 2025, under cause number 25-0378. There 
 
are now three concurrent mandamuses before this Honorable Court, but the risk of 
compounding error continues down below. 
Z. Risk of Future Error 
 
An Order of Assignment was forwarded by the coordinator from the 
Honorable David L. Evans appointing Senior Chief Justice John Cayce to oversee 
the recusal matters on May 6, 2025 (R. 3148-3150). Because the Order of 
Assignment still incorrectly named the Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer and the 
coordinator was still handling the matters, Father filed a second objection (R. 
3151-3166).

AA. The Need for Relief Continues 
On May 12, 2025, Father filed an Affidavit in cause number 25-0361 
reiterating the need for an emergency stay of the trial court proceedings (R. 3488-
3500). Three days later, the Honorable David L. Evans overruled the Father’s 
objections regarding the involvement of the court coordinator and the Hon. Kaitcer 
motion which was never filed (R. 3506-3508). The next day, Father filed an 
emergency notice with the Court reiterating that the date by which he requested 
relief was approaching, and he reiterated the need for an emergency stay and 
reminded the Court that no opposition to the relief being sought had been raised. 
(R. 3501-3505). 
AB. Mandamus #4 
On May 19, 2025, the Father filed a Petition for Writ of Mandamus 
before this Court as an Original Proceeding which was docketed as case 
number 25-0426 on the grounds that the Regional Presiding Judge’s refusal to 
comply with Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure was an abuse of 
discretion (R. 3509-3559). Father then prepared a Case Memorandum and filed 
it in that cause number (R. 3837-3876). The next day, Father filed an 
Emergency Motion to Stay reiterating the need for a stay of the proceedings 
below given errors continue to compound. (R. 3877-3896).

the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County (R. 3897-3900). An order was also 
issued denying the recusal of Hon. Jeff Kaitcer, referring to a motion that was 
never filed. (R. 3901-3904). The next day, Father filed a Notice of Intent to 
File Mandamus, raising the issue “…that the record, on its face, demonstrates a 
clear deviation from procedural due process and established Texas 
jurisprudence regarding recusal proceedings, warranting immediate corrective 
action to uphold this court’s impartiality and public confidence in the 
judiciary.” (R. 3905-3914). 
AD. Striking the OAG 
Finally, on May 22, 2025, Father filed a Motion to Strike the Intervention 
of the Office of the Attorney General requesting that  “[i]f a justiciable interest 
cannot be demonstrated or if a response is not filed by a future date deemed 
appropriate by the Court, order that the intervention pleading from the Office of

II. Legal Analysis 
 
The Texas Supreme Court’s authority to consolidate multiple mandamus 
petitions stems primarily from its constitutional responsibility for judicial 
administration. The Texas Constitution explicitly states that “The Supreme Court is 
responsible for the efficient administration of the judicial branch and shall 
promulgate rules of administration not inconsistent with the laws of the state as 
may be necessary for the efficient and uniform administration of justice in the 
various courts.” Tex. Const. art. 5 § 31. This constitutional provision establishes 
the Supreme Court's fundamental responsibility to ensure that the judicial system 
operates efficiently, and that justice is administered uniformly across Texas courts. 
This constitutional mandate grants the Texas Supreme Court broad authority 
to develop and implement administrative procedures that promote judicial 
efficiency. The consolidation of multiple mandamus petitions involving the same 
parties represents a procedural mechanism that directly serves this constitutional 
objective by allowing the court to address related issues in a single proceeding 
rather than through separate, potentially duplicative proceedings.

Court is the failure of the trial court to apply the law correctly and bias toward the 
Relator. There is no basis for this matter’s fact pattern to exist – yet it does. 
Between four mandamus petitions, not a single response has been filed. This is not 
by strategy – but because there is no explanation for these collective actions. Each 
case should be consolidated into cause number 25-0361 because all subsequent 
mandamuses extend from this abuse of discretion. In sum, the issues presented 
reflect an associate judge who disregarded due process and exceeded his statutory 
authority under the Texas Family Code, a second Associate Judge who refused to 
hear a properly filed TRO after securing a hearing date, a District Judge who 
improperly sua sponte granted the opposing party’s Motion to Consolidate to 
prevent mandamus review, and a Regional Presiding Judge who refused to follow 
the mandatory requirements of 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. In total, 
this breakdown of justice warrants consolidated mandamus review and will 
continue to compound without a stay put in place. 
2. Judicial Efficiency 
Consolidating the cases could promote judicial efficiency by allowing the 
Supreme Court to address the systemic issues raised across multiple petitions in a 
single proceeding. This includes the alleged abuse of discretion by lower courts to 
follow mandatory procedures such as consolidation and recusal proceedings and 
the need for mandamus relief to correct these errors. (25-0378 & 25-0426).

3. Consistency in Rulings 
 
Given the similar nature of the legal questions and the involvement of the 
same parties, consolidation would help ensure consistent rulings and avoid 
conflicting decisions from different courts. This is particularly important in cases 
involving fundamental rights, such as parental rights, where uniformity in legal 
standards is crucial. Here, fundamental rights to property and custody of one’s 
children are at issue. 
4. Extraordinary Circumstances  
 
The petitions argue that extraordinary circumstances exist, warranting the 
Texas Supreme Court's intervention. These include the ongoing irreparable harm to 
the relator's parental rights, parent-child relationship, business, and highlight the 
inadequacy of ordinary appellate or administrative remedies due to procedural 
violations and judicial inaction as evidenced by the compounding errors and lack 
of response. (25-0361, 25-0367, 25-0378, and 25-0426) 
CONCLUSION 
For all these reasons, the Court should consolidate cause numbers 25-0367, 
25-0378, and 25-0426 into the first-filed case 25-0361. The Relator prays this court 
uphold its’ laws, protect the parent-child relationship, and hopes it refuses to 
permit the conduct that’s occurred in this case from going un-checked. Otherwise, 
what good are the laws of this State if a trial court can selectively uphold them?
