II. LEGAL VIOLATIONS BY FAILURE TO RULE ON MOTIONS 
1. Failure to Rule on Unopposed Motions Violates Texas Law 
A. Texas courts have a duty to rule on properly filed motions within a reasonable 
time (In re Blakeney, 254 S.W.3d 659 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2008)). 
B. Courts cannot ignore motions indefinitely, especially when they remain 
unopposed (In re Bonds, 57 S.W.3d 456 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2001)). 
2. Due Process Violations (14th Amendment, U.S. Constitution; Article I, § 19, Texas 
Constitution) 
A. The Court’s refusal to issue rulings or set hearings deprives Respondent of due 
process rights. 
B. The failure to act on Rule 12 Motion to Show Authority means opposing 
counsel may be practicing unlawfully, rendering all their filings void.

Il. LEGAL VIOLATIONS BY FAILURE TO RULE ON MOTIONS

1. Failure to Rule on Unopposed Motions Violates Texas Law

A. Texas courts have a duty to rule on properly filed motions within a reasonable

time (/n re Blakeney, 254 S.W.3d 659 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2008)).

B. Courts cannot ignore motions indefinitely, especially when they remain

unopposed (Jn re Bonds, 57 S.W.3d 456 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2001)).

2. Due Process Violations (14th Amendment, U.S. Constitution; Article I, § 19, Texas

Constitution)

A. The Court’s refusal to issue rulings or set hearings deprives Respondent of due

process rights.

B. The failure to act on Rule 12 Motion to Show Authority means opposing

counsel may be practicing unlawfully, rendering all their filings void.

3. Failure to Act on Emergency Motions & Summary Judgment

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
6 
 
A. The Court’s inaction on emergency motions for custody and residence is a 
direct failure of its duty to prioritize the best interest of children (Tex. Fam. 
Code § 153.002). 
B. The Court has no discretion to ignore properly filed summary judgment 
motions, especially when unopposed (Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c)). There is no 
genuine issue of material fact, and the Respondent is entitled to relief as a matter 
of law. 
III. CONTINUED SILENCE FROM OPPOSING PARTY DESPITE GLARING MISUSE 
OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM 
1. The opposing party in this case has refused to prosecute for over four months. 
2. The Petitioner in this case has unquestionably deceived this court into relying on 
false claims of indigency and false claims for protection. 
3. The Respondent has filed over 4,700 pages of documents that have been ignored 
outright by the court, the opposing party, and court staff. 
4. The Petitioner continues to neglect the children medically, continues to escape 
accountability for her egregious actions, and has offered no rebuttal or defense 
against any of the claims made against her. 
5. The Respondent continues to suffer monetary damages each day this situation 
persists without resolution. 
6. The court has been given ample information to justify an immediate ruling as 
required by law, yet the Respondent continues to be stonewalled.

7. The current temporary orders state all parties agree to the terms of the order, 
reference a hearing not found on the docket sheet, yet continue to remain in effect 
despite several pleas for correction being submitted and reviewed by court staff. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
 
Respondent reasserts that Texas Law prevents such scenarios such as what is occurring in 
this case from happening, yet it continues unaddressed. Respondent only asks of this court, the 
reviewing staff, and any reviewing judicial officer that Texas laws be followed, and that this 
situation be immediately corrected. The systemic abuse faced by the Respondent has damaged 
the children’s well-being and permitted the Petitioner to continue to get away with her immoral 
actions that have placed fraud upon this court without consequence. 
 
Respondent urges this court to make swift, corrective decisions that are warranted by 
setting immediately ruling upon the pending motions before it and granting the long overdue 
relief that is both necessary and justified.
