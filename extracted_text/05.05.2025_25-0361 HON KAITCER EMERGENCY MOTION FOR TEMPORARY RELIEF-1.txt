TO THE HONORABLE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS:  
Relator Charles Dustin Myers, pro se, respectfully moves under Tex. R. App. P. 
52.10 for temporary relief pending resolution of his petition for writ of mandamus. 
Specifically, Relator seeks a stay of the March 26, 2024, temporary orders in Cause 
No. 322-744263-23, pending this Court’s consideration of the mandamus petition. 
This Motion is based on the following facts and authorities: 
1. Background and Urgency 
On March 26, 2024, the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County entered 
temporary orders (in No. 322-744263-23) imposing custody and possession terms 
over Relator’s children and directing Relator’s compliance with an associate 
judge’s proposed order. Relator contested these orders and timely requested a 
de novo hearing under Tex. Fam. Code § 201.015. The orders were not signed by 
the referring judge and, Relator contends, were entered without his valid consent or 
hearing, making them void and beyond the court’s authority. Meanwhile, the orders 
have gone into effect: Relator has already been locked out of his home and denied 
access to his children under the terms of those orders. This situation is urgent and 
causing irreparable harm. Specifically, loss of access to his residence and the 
children’s caregiving routine cannot be undone later. The children’s routines and 
family stability are disrupted, and Relator’s parental rights are being effectively

TO THE HONORABLE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS:

Relator Charles Dustin Myers, pro se, respectfully moves under Tex. R. App. P.
52.10 for temporary relief pending resolution of his petition for writ of mandamus.
Specifically, Relator seeks a stay of the March 26, 2024, temporary orders in Cause
No. 322-744263-23, pending this Court’s consideration of the mandamus petition.
This Motion is based on the following facts and authorities:

1. Background and Urgency

On March 26, 2024, the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County entered
temporary orders (in No. 322-744263-23) imposing custody and possession terms
over Relator’s children and directing Relator’s compliance with an associate
judge’s proposed order. Relator contested these orders and timely requested a
de novo hearing under Tex. Fam. Code § 201.015. The orders were not signed by
the referring judge and, Relator contends, were entered without his valid consent or
hearing, making them void and beyond the court’s authority. Meanwhile, the orders
have gone into effect: Relator has already been locked out of his home and denied
access to his children under the terms of those orders. This situation is urgent and
causing irreparable harm. Specifically, loss of access to his residence and the
children’s caregiving routine cannot be undone later. The children’s routines and

family stability are disrupted, and Relator’s parental rights are being effectively

suspended indefinitely. These harms are irreparable and immediate, as a mere 
damages remedy on appeal would be inadequate to restore the status quo. 
2. Irreparable Harm 
Relator’s loss of home access and parental contact is irreparable. Once 
physically removed from his own home and daily parenting roles, the damage 
cannot be fully remedied by a later appeal. The children are growing up without 
their father’s care, and the family home is effectively beyond Relator’s reach. Such 
injuries — to parental rights and family integrity — constitute irreparable harm in 
equity. Relator will suffer these harms continuously until the orders are vacated or 
stayed. By contrast, granting a temporary stay will merely maintain the status quo 
that existed immediately before March 26, 2024, pending review, and will cause no 
substantial injury to any party. 
3. No Opposition Filed 
Relator is not aware of any objection to this motion. The petition for mandamus 
was filed on May 1, 2025, and to date neither the respondent judge nor the real 
party in interest has filed any opposition to the request for extraordinary relief. 
Given this absence of opposition, there is no prejudice in granting the stay, and the 
benefits afforded to the Relator and the Children would outweigh the detriments 
caused by these orders remaining in effect.

suspended indefinitely. These harms are irreparable and immediate, as a mere

4. Notice to Parties.  
Relator has given notice of this Emergency Motion to all necessary parties by 
expedited means, as required by Tex. R. App. P. 52.10(a). On May 1, 2025, Relator 
sent an email to Judge Kaitcer through his court coordinator, informing the court 
that this motion was being filed and requesting prompt consideration. Relator also 
emailed Cooper L. Carter, attorney for Real Party in Interest, at the contact 
information on file to notify her of the motion. To Relator’s knowledge, no party 
objects to the requested relief, nor has opposed this relief on the record.  
    5. Requested Relief 
Relator respectfully requests that the Court grant a temporary stay of all 
provisions of the March 26, 2024 temporary orders in Cause No. 322-744263-23, 
pending resolution of the mandamus petition. Immediate relief is necessary to 
prevent ongoing and irreparable injury resulting from the Relator being prevented 
access to his family home. Relator therefore requests that this Court enter its order 
as soon as practicable, without waiting for the 10-day waiting period. The Court’s 
prompt action is appropriate under Tex. R. App. P. 52.10(b), which authorizes the 
Court to “grant any just relief pending the court’s action on the petition.” Granting 
the stay will preserve the status quo and protect the children’s welfare and 
Relator’s rights during the pendency of this petition.
