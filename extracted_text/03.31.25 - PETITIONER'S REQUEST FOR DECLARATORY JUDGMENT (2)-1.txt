Northern District of Texas on December 6, 2024.

2. The case was remanded on December 8, 2024, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

4. This places the obligation on COOPER L. CARTER to file with the clerk of the state court a 
certified notice of remand, which she has failed to do as of March 31, 2025, nearly three months 
later. 
5. COOPER L. CARTER’s authority to represent MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS has been in question  
since September 20, 2024, over six months ago and is in question in this matter. 
6. COOPER L. CARTER has never filed a pleading on MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS’ behalf in either 
this court or the 322nd district court since she was allegedly retained on January 22, 2024, over fourteen 
months ago. 
7. RODERICK D. MARX has filed every pleading on behalf of COOPER L. CARTER in both this matter  
and the divorce matter. 
8. RODERICK D. MARX has not made an appearance or otherwise been named as a party in either suit. 
9. Neither RODERICK D. MARX nor COOPER L. CARTER have filed any response to any pleadings 
served to them by CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS. 
10. Neither RODERICK D. MARX nor COOPER L. CARTER have filed any pleading since April 24, 
2024 in the divorce matter, nearly twelve months ago. 
11. COOPER L. CARTER has left the 322nd District Court without jurisdiction and has no ability 
to reinstate it, thereby resulting in an inevitable dismissal for want of prosecution. 
12. COOPER L. CARTER cannot reinstate jurisdiction because her EFM is registered to her 
prior employer’s email address, which has been pointed out several times by Petitioner. 
13. Therefore, the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County has lost continuous exclusive 
jurisdiction of the minor children in this suit and this SAPCR is properly before this court. 
14. On March 28, 2025, the Petitioner arrived at the 233rd District Court to present his 
emergency TRO as scheduled with the Court Coordinator on March 27, 2025.

instead file the pleading with the 322nd District Court.

23. At the close of business on March 28, 2025, nothing was ever filed with the 322nd District 
Court by COOPER L. CARTER.

II. ARGUMENT 
The statement of facts, unless promptly rebutted by COOPER L. CARTER, warrant 
immediate relief as duly requested in the emergency TRO through a declaratory 
judgement, and this court should proceed with the hearing date originally set for April 
10th, 2025, and the emergency TRO should be GRANTED without further delay. 
COOPER L. CARTER disrupted much needed relief for the minor children in this 
case with false promises delivered to the tribunal that directly undermined the 
Petitioner’s due process rights.  
Petitioner reasserts his position that COOPER L. CARTER is acting without 
authority, has no ability to reinstate jurisdiction to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant 
County, and cannot explain how she is able to abandon a case for nearly a full calendar 
year, yet can suddenly show up to defend before this court for the sole purpose to 
prevent Petitioner’s emergency TRO from being heard. 
It may be a needle in the haystack, but this case defies the initial presumption that 
pro-se litigants are not as equipped or as capable as licensed attorneys, and it is no fault 
of COOPER L. CARTER. The Petitioner reminds the court that the true culprit 
responsible for this remains the puppet master hiding in the background – the 
Respondent – and yet Petitioner wishes no harm to her because this litigation is about 
the children. The children need their mother, but they also need their father.  
Perhaps the zealous passion has been misunderstood for contempt by the tribunal, 
but Petitioner’s motive runs parallel to that set forth in the Texas Family Code. 
However, despite the procedural quagmire, the anomalies, the pro-se status, the 
solution remains simple:

Il. ARGUMENT

The statement of facts, unless promptly rebutted by COOPER L. CARTER, warrant
immediate relief as duly requested in the emergency TRO through a declaratory
judgement, and this court should proceed with the hearing date originally set for April
10", 2025, and the emergency TRO should be GRANTED without further delay.

COOPER L. CARTER disrupted much needed relief for the minor children in this
case with false promises delivered to the tribunal that directly undermined the
Petitioner’s due process rights.

Petitioner reasserts his position that COOPER L. CARTER is acting without
authority, has no ability to reinstate jurisdiction to the 322" District Court of Tarrant
County, and cannot explain how she is able to abandon a case for nearly a full calendar
year, yet can suddenly show up to defend before this court for the sole purpose to
prevent Petitioner’s emergency TRO from being heard.

It may be a needle in the haystack, but this case defies the initial presumption that
pro-se litigants are not as equipped or as capable as licensed attorneys, and it is no fault
of COOPER L. CARTER. The Petitioner reminds the court that the true culprit
responsible for this remains the puppet master hiding in the background — the
Respondent — and yet Petitioner wishes no harm to her because this litigation is about
the children. The children need their mother, but they also need their father.

Perhaps the zealous passion has been misunderstood for contempt by the tribunal,
but Petitioner’s motive runs parallel to that set forth in the Texas Family Code.
However, despite the procedural quagmire, the anomalies, the pro-se status, the

solution remains simple:

Grant the relief. Nobody has argued against it, Texas law allows it, and the 
best interests of the Children encourage it and depend on it. I welcome any response 
from COOPER L. CARTER to the contrary. 
 
If approached from a logical standpoint, the situation can be interpreted as 
such: 
i. 
COOPER L. CARTER is shackled by Rule 12 and Rule 237a of the 
Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. 
ii. 
The 322nd District Court is shackled from proceeding due to never 
being reinstated jurisdiction. 
iii. 
The Petitioner is shackled from his home, his children’s daily lives, 
and his place of business under facially void orders. 
iv. 
Most critically, the children are shackled in a situation that is not in 
their best interests and continue to suffer irreparable harm without 
any opportunity for relief. 
 
Indeed, that leaves just one party un-chained from this situation:  
the Respondent. Petitioner rests his case. 
 
 
Respectfully submitted,

such:

If approached from a logical standpoint, the situation can be interpreted as

iil.

COOPER L. CARTER is shackled by Rule 12 and Rule 237a of the
Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.

The 322" District Court is shackled from proceeding due to never
being reinstated jurisdiction.

The Petitioner is shackled from his home, his children’s daily lives,
and his place of business under facially void orders.

Most critically, the children are shackled in a situation that is not in
their best interests and continue to suffer irreparable harm without

any opportunity for relief.

Indeed, that leaves just one party un-chained from this situation:

the Respondent. Petitioner rests his case.

Respectfully submitted,
