Returning home around 1:30 A.M. CST, the text records show that Petitioner began 
communicating via text message with her Stepfather, Daniel Kenneth Branthoover of Yukon, 
Oklahoma at approximately 3:29 A.M. CST. See CMR. p.278. 
10. 
These communications escalated the following day on December 14, 2023, totaling to 
over 90 text messaged exchanged, which is the same day that the Petitioner sought her first ex-
parte order of protection from this Court. See CMR. p.274-278. See also CMR. p.78 ¶ 9B. 
11. 
Over the weekend of December 15, 2023, Petitioner traveled to Yukon, Oklahoma, where 
she received assistance in drafting the initial documents submitted to this Court on December 18, 
2023, acquired a secondary phone registered under 817-940-0852 which was used in these 
proceedings, and transferred $1,576 of marital funds to herself using Daniel Branthoover’s 
PayPal as a medium. See CMR. p.1706. (bank statement showing monetary transfer). See also 
CMR. p.2866. (unanswered request for admissions). See also CMR. p.1715. (text message from 
Petitioner admitting to monetary transfer on December 17, 2023).

iii. 
The Petitioner claimed to be financially responsible for the 2023 Mazda CX-5 and 
 
 
a 2021 Mazda CX3 which the couple never owned despite this amount exceeding  
 
 
her alleged monthly income. See CMR. p.93 ¶ 8. 
15. 
Finally, Petitioner submitted a Request for Uncontested Cases Form which 
misrepresented that this matter is uncontested. See CMR. p.102. 
16. 
Four days later on December 22, 2023, Petitioner filed for another protective order 
despite claiming to already have an existing order of protection. See CMR. p.103-109. 
17. 
In the application for protective order, Petitioner made the following misrepresentations: 
 
i. 
The Petitioner claimed family violence occurred on December 18, 2023, yet  
 
 
waited four days to inform the Court despite filing for divorce on that same day.  
 
 
See CMR. p.108-109. 
 
ii. 
The Petitioner has failed to produce any evidence for these allegations in nearly  
 
 
two years of litigation. 
 
iii. 
The Petitioner can be seen at home with the Respondent and the Children on the  
 
 
same day she filed for protection in no state of emergency. See CMR. p.1716.  
 
 
(image of petitioner at home with Respondent getting the Children ready for bed;

19. 
After this initial decision was made, Petitioner began to leverage her advantage against 
the Respondent as he was thrusted into a situation where he had to acquire legal representation 
on very short notice, only having until January 22, 2024, to do so. 
20. 
On this day, which was the reset hearing before Associate Judge Kaitcer regarding 
Petitioner’s Application for Protective Order, no appearances can be found in the docket, no 
hearing took place, and the Respondent’s deprivation was extended until February 1, 2024, 
because the Petitioner waited until right before the hearing to allegedly retain the services of 
Cooper L. Carter (“Carter”) in the lobby of the courtroom. See CMR. p.186. (associate judge’s 
report resetting the case to February 1, 2024, where Carter’s signature first appears in this matter) 
21. 
Despite communicating with his attorney regarding his goals, the children’s needs, and 
his reliance on the home for generating income for the family, Dan Bacalis proved to be 
ineffective in his representation. See CMR. p. 818, ¶¶ 9–11, 13. (communications with Dan 
Bacalis) 
22. 
After little communication from Dan Bacalis, Respondent reached out and informed him 
that he would be terminating his services and shared his feelings regarding the quality of service 
that was being provided. See CMR. p.819 ¶ 14. 
23. 
Despite these concerns, and with no recorded appearances within the case docket, the 
parties appeared on February 1, 2024, where the Respondent was presented with the sole option 
of a settlement agreement and was given a month back in the home. See CMR. p.229-234. 
(‘agreed’ associate judge’s report signed February 1, 2024)

(‘agreed’ associate judge’s report signed February 1, 2024)
24. — Respondent “...disagreed with the conditions in the document and advised Mr. Bacalis

violence. Mr. Bacalis advised Mr. Myers that he “knows this Judge and this is the best we can

get”. Mr. Bacalis stated in whining manner “We’ll be here all day; we can come back and change 
it later”. Mr. Bacalis stated “no one will put a gun to your head if you are not out by March 1st.” 
See CMR. p.1368. (affidavit of Steve Myers, witness) 
25. 
This is when Respondent paid special attention to the following provisions of the 
agreement found on CMR. p.233: 
 
 
A typed written Order conforming to this Report will follow within 20 days from 
 
the date this Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be prepared by Dan Bacalis. 
 
Each attorney should approve the Order. The parties do not need to approve the Order. 
 
The attorney reviewing the proposed order shall have five (5) days to do so. There are no 
 
ten (10) day letters. If an agreement is not reached, a Motion to Sign shall be filed and 
 
set within thirty (30) days from the signing of this Report. (emphasis added) 
 
26. 
Therefore, we can gather based on the language that this agreement: 
 
 
i.  
Required Dan Bacalis to prepare the typed written order; 
 
 
ii. 
The attorney  reviewing the proposed order would therefore be Cooper L.  
 
 
 
Carter, attorney for Petitioner. 
 
 
iii. 
If an agreement was not reached, a motion to sign was required to be filed  
 
 
 
and set within 30 days of February 1, 2024. 
27. 
Given these provisions, the Respondent signed the agreement, and immediately 
terminated his attorney thereafter and provided notice to the Court and opposing parties on 
February 5, 2024. See CMR. p.221-222. (notice of termination of legal counsel) 
28. 
Following his termination, Respondent prepared an EMERGENCY MOTION TO 
RECONSIDER EVIDENCE AND VACATE TEMPORARY ORDERS. See CMR. p.240-243. 
This was filed alongside a brief and several exhibits that highlighted the Petitioner’s dishonesty. 
See CMR. p.244-252. (brief in support of emergency motion); See also CMR. p.254-714 (text 
records highlighting mothers extensive communications with Damen Kazlauskas); CMR. p.716-

27. Given these provisions, the Respondent signed the agreement, and immediately
terminated his attorney thereafter and provided notice to the Court and opposing parties on

February 5, 2024. See CMR. p.221-222. (notice of termination of legal counsel)

28. — Following his termination, Respondent prepared an EMERGENCY MOTION TO

RECONSIDER EVIDENCE AND VACATE TEMPORARY ORDERS. See CMR. p.240-243.

This was filed alongside a brief and several exhibits that highlighted the Petitioner’s dishonesty.

The opposing counsel, Cooper L. Carter, sent correspondence informing the Respondent 
that she would be filing a counter motion on February 14, 2024. See CMR. p.2794. 
30. 
By March 4, 2024, Respondent filed a notice with the Court informing the opposing side 
and the Court that he would not be leaving the matrimonial residence as it would not be in the 
best interests of the children. 
31. 
Two days later, while walking the Children to school, Petitioner took it upon herself to 
lock the Respondent out of the marital residence and left a sign on the door. See CMR. p.829 at 
2024-03-06. (video of Respondent taking the children to school that morning and the sign on the 
door left by Petitioner) 
32. 
It’s noteworthy that this action came without any response being filed to the emergency 
motion served on her nearly a month prior. 
33. 
Respondent stayed in Flower Mound, Texas, with his father until the March 14, 2024, 
hearing on his emergency motion.

On March 14, 2024, the parties both appeared before Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer, 
despite only the Respondent making an appearance on the case docket. See Exhibit 1, p.3 at

that she would be filing a counter motion on February 14, 2024. See CMR. p.2794.

30. — By March 4, 2024, Respondent filed a notice with the Court informing the opposing side
and the Court that he would not be leaving the matrimonial residence as it would not be in the
best interests of the children.

31. Two days later, while walking the Children to school, Petitioner took it upon herself to
lock the Respondent out of the marital residence and left a sign on the door. See CMR. p.829 at
2024-03-06. (video of Respondent taking the children to school that morning and the sign on the
door left by Petitioner)

32. It’s noteworthy that this action came without any response being filed to the emergency
motion served on her nearly a month prior.

33. Respondent stayed in Flower Mound, Texas, with his father until the March 14, 2024,
hearing on his emergency motion.

34. On March 14, 2024, the parties both appeared before Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer,
despite only the Respondent making an appearance on the case docket. See Exhibit 1, p.3 at

DKT. No. 78.

Without responding to the motion, and in violation of the provisions outlined above, 
Cooper L. Carter handed the Respondent the typed written “Temporary Orders” with actual 
knowledge that: 
 
i.  
Dan Bacalis did not prepare the order; 
 
ii. 
An agreement was not reached and no motion to sign was ever filed or set within  
 
 
the agreed upon timeframe. 
36. 
Upon inspection of this document, which was signed by both the Petitioner and her 
Counsel, the following misrepresentations were made to the Court: 
 
i. 
That on February 1, 2024, a hearing occurred regarding a motion for temporary  
 
 
orders when this setting was a reset hearing from the initial protective order  
 
 
setting on January 16, 2024, later extended to January 22, 2024, and then   
 
 
February 1, 2024.  
 
ii. 
That the Court heard arguments and evidence from both sides when in reality the  
 
 
parties had a hallway settlement conference and no evidence was presented. See  
 
 
CMR. p.888. 
 
iii. 
That the orders were in the best interests of the children and the prerequisites of  
 
 
the law have been met. 
 
iv. 
That the parties agree to the terms of the order ‘as evidenced by the signatures  
 
 
below’. See CMR. p.888. 
37. 
Furthermore, Cooper L. Carter, despite not filing any response to the emergency motion, 
handed Associate Judge Jeff Kaitcer a proposed order in the form of an ‘associate judge’s report’ 
requesting that his motion be denied. See CMR. p.795.

She was required under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 166a(i) to produce competent evidence 
raising a genuine fact issue on each challenged element of her claims. Instead, she offers only 
conclusory, self-serving assertions (in an affidavit and scattered exhibits) and promises of what 
she “plans to give at trial,” which do not satisfy her burden. It remains undisputed that Mother 
has no evidence for the essential elements identified in the motion. Indeed, she ignored written 
discovery entirely, causing Requests for Admission to be deemed admitted by operation of 
law. Texas law does not permit a claimant to continue a lawsuit in the absence of evidence.

corroborate her sensational claims. She even withdrew her own protective order application

case, does she submit a self-serving affidavit that was drafted on March 27, 2025, and a handful 
of text messages in an effort to create a fact issue. The Court should view these belated 
accusations with extreme skepticism. Unsupported assertions and post hoc allegations cannot

her claims. In short, Petitioner’s response falls far short of the requirements of Rule 166a(i). The 
Court should grant summary judgment in Respondent’s favor, dismissing all of Mother’s 
unsupported claims so that Respondent may return to his home and family life, and his 
constitutional rights as a father and homeowner may be restored. 
IV. No-Evidence Summary Judgment Standards 
45. 
Under Rule 166a(i), once a no-evidence motion identifies the essential elements where 
no proof exists, the burden shifts to the non-movant to produce “more than a scintilla of 
evidence” raising a genuine issue of material fact on each challenged element. If the non-movant 
fails, the Court must grant summary judgment. “More than a scintilla” means evidence sufficient 
to enable reasonable and fair-minded jurors to differ in their conclusions; by contrast, evidence 
so weak that it creates only a surmise or suspicion of fact is legally insufficient. Crucially, 
allegations in pleadings or mere promises of future testimony do not constitute evidence. The 
non-movant must present actual, admissible proof now – such as documents, affidavits, or 
deposition testimony – to demonstrate a fact issue. Texas courts have emphasized that a party 
cannot avoid summary judgment with conclusory self-serving statements or by simply arguing 
that evidence “may be produced” later. 
46. 
Here, Respondent’s motion was timely filed after an adequate time for discovery and 
specifically identified the elements lacking evidence. Mother was therefore required to point out 
competent summary judgment evidence for each of those elements. She has not done so. As 
detailed below, her response relies on speculation and unverified accusations rather than 
admissible proof. Because Mother failed to meet her burden, Rule 166a(i) mandates that 
summary judgment be entered in favor of Respondent.

V. Mother’s Complete Failure to Present Evidence on Challenged Elements 
47. 
Respondent’s motion challenged six essential elements of Mother’s claims on which she 
bears the burden of proof. Mother’s response does not present more than a scintilla of 
competent, admissible evidence on any of these elements: 
i. No Evidence of Alleged Family Violence: Mother has produced no credible evidence 
that any “family violence” (as defined by Texas Family Code § 71.004) ever occurred 
during the marriage. She alleges an incident on December 18, 2023, but offers nothing to 
substantiate it beyond her own belated accusations. There are no police reports, medical 
records, or third-party affidavits to corroborate any injury or assault. In fact, Mother’s 
own conduct undercuts her claims – after the alleged December 18 incident, she 
continued living with Father and took no immediate action consistent with being an 
abuse victim. When given the opportunity to prove family violence in court, she 
withdrew her application for a protective order prior to any hearing. This withdrawal 
speaks louder than her late-breaking statements. Mother’s new accusations of harassment 
and drug use are likewise unsupported by any evidence (no witness statements, no 
requested drug tests, nothing) and were never properly raised until now. Unverified 
allegations in an affidavit drafted several months ago – especially after a long silence – 
are not enough to raise a fact issue. At most, Mother’s affidavit creates only a “surmise 
or suspicion” of violence, which is legally insufficient. Because she has no competent 
evidence of any family violence, this essential element of her fault-based claims fails as a 
matter of law.

family violence against Respondent that was in effect at the time of filing this suit. It is 
undisputed that no court ever issued a protective order in this case. Mother did file an 
Application for Protective Order on December 22, 2023, but she never followed through 
– the application was withdrawn before any hearing could be held. Thus, there is no 
signed Protective Order in the record, and no judicial finding that family violence 
occurred. Texas law requires a formal hearing and a separate, written order to grant a 
family-violence protective order (Tex. Fam. Code §§ 85.001, 85.004). Mother has neither. 
In her response, Mother vaguely refers to a protective order as if one exists, but this is 
misleading. There was only a temporary ex parte order at most (by application) which 
expired when the February 1, 2024 agreed temporary orders were entered. Since then, no 
protective order exists. Mother’s inability to produce an actual order or judgment 
renders any claim or relief predicated on a protective order completely unsupported. In 
sum, the non-existence of a protective order is an incontrovertible fact that negates 
Mother’s allegations to the contrary. 
iii. No Evidence of Financial Indigency (False Affidavit of Inability to Pay): Mother 
also failed to produce evidence that she was genuinely indigent on the date she filed this 
suit. In her Original Petition (filed December 18, 2023), Mother submitted a sworn 
Affidavit of Inability to Pay Costs claiming extreme financial hardship. However, this 
claim is conclusively refuted by objective facts in the record. Just days before filing, on 
December 15, 2023, Mother withdrew $1,576 in marital funds – funds which she did 
not disclose in her indigency affidavit. She claimed to have only $21 to her name, yet 
evidence shows she had access to substantial community money. Mother has offered no 
bank statements, income records, or any financial documents to support her

indigency assertion. To the contrary, the available evidence (including her own 
transactions) shows she had resources and even managed to allegedly hire private counsel 
shortly after filing. Without any evidence substantiating “true indigence,” Mother’s 
affidavit of inability to pay is proven false. Texas law provides that a suit filed on a false 
indigency affidavit may be dismissed or sanctions imposed, because the Practice & 
Remedies Code does not tolerate proceeding in forma pauperis under false pretenses. At 
the very least, the lack of evidence for indigency means Mother cannot carry any burden 
tied to her financial status or claims for relief premised on indigency. This element, too, 
fails as a matter of law. 
iv. No Evidence that Temporary Orders Were Properly Entered or Valid: Mother’s 
response leans heavily on the Temporary Orders signed in early 2024, claiming they 
should remain in effect and are in the children’s best interest. But Mother produces no 
evidence that those February 1, 2024 temporary orders were obtained with the required 
due process or formalities. In fact, the record shows serious irregularities with how those 
orders came about. Mother cannot point to any notice or hearing on her December 27, 
2023, motion for temporary relief that resulted in the February 1 orders, and the case 
docket shows that the Petitioner’s only appearance in this matter was on January 16, 
2024. There is no transcript or reporter’s record of any evidence presented on 
February 1, 2024. There is not even a file-marked copy of the temporary orders motion 
showing it was properly served on Respondent in advance. Absent proof that Respondent 
received due notice and an actual evidentiary hearing was held on February 1, the 
resulting Temporary Orders “lack a lawful foundation.” In short, Mother has no 
evidence that the procedural prerequisites (notice, an opportunity to be heard, and a

hearing on the merits) were satisfied before the court signed those sweeping temporary 
orders. This calls into question the validity and enforceability of the orders she seeks to 
uphold. Moreover, Mother repeatedly refers to the February 1 proceeding as an “Agreed” 
temporary orders hearing, yet it is undisputed that Respondent never actually agreed to 
the terms that were later signed. Mother has no evidence – no signed consent, no email 
acceptance, nothing – showing that Respondent approved the specific terms of the 
“Agreed” Temporary Orders that were entered on March 14, 2024. To the contrary, all 
evidence indicates Respondent objected to those terms at every opportunity: the orders 
were drafted unilaterally by Petitioner’s counsel and presented to the court without 
Respondent’s signature or consent. The signature line for Respondent on the face of the 
order is conspicuously blank, confirming he did not sign it. Respondent has provided 
sworn testimony (in the mandamus record and elsewhere) that he never agreed and 
voiced his objections, which stands unchallenged by any evidence from Mother. Thus, 
Petitioner cannot demonstrate that the temporary orders were the product of a valid 
agreement or hearing – an essential underpinning of their legitimacy. In fact, Petitioner’s 
counsel, Cooper L. Carter, materially altered and submitted the proposed order after the 
February 1 hearing, without following proper process or obtaining Respondent’s 
approval, which amounts to a fraud on the court. Respondent promptly filed an 
emergency motion on February 9, 2024, to alert the Court to these improprieties and to 
vacate the temporary orders, but that motion was effectively brushed aside without any 
cure for the underlying due process violations despite receiving no response from the 
opposing side. Mother’s response offers no rebuttal to these facts; she does not deny the 
lack of notice or the ex parte submission of the order. Because Mother has no evidence

that the temporary orders were entered with due process or valid agreement, she cannot 
rely on those orders as a shield to avoid summary judgment. Any claims premised on the 
validity of the February 1, 2024 proceedings are unsupported and cannot stand, and are 
contradicted by the face of the record. 
v. No Evidence that Temporary Orders Are in the Children’s Best Interest: Even 
setting aside the procedural flaws, Mother has no evidence that the content of the current 
Temporary Orders (which give her exclusive occupancy of the marital home and severely 
limit Father’s possession of the children) is in the best interest of the children. Under 
Texas law, the “best interest of the child shall always be the primary consideration” in 
determining conservatorship and access. Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002. If Mother wishes to 
justify the highly restrictive temporary orders, she bears the burden to prove those orders 
benefit the children. Yet she offers nothing of the sort. There is no expert testimony or 
evaluation from a mental health professional supporting Mother’s position. There are no 
statements from the children’s teachers or doctors, no school or medical records 
indicating the children are better off under the current temporary arrangement. In fact, 
Mother disobeyed a court-ordered parenting course (which was meant to help the 
children cope with the family situation), demonstrating a disregard for the children’s best 
interests. By contrast, Respondent has continually asserted that removing the children 
from their father and home has been harmful to them, and Mother’s own evidence

that the temporary orders were entered with due process or valid agreement, she cannot
rely on those orders as a shield to avoid summary judgment. Any claims premised on the
validity of the February 1, 2024 proceedings are unsupported and cannot stand, and are
contradicted by the face of the record.

v. No Evidence that Temporary Orders Are in the Children’s Best Interest: Even
setting aside the procedural flaws, Mother has no evidence that the content of the current
Temporary Orders (which give her exclusive occupancy of the marital home and severely
limit Father’s possession of the children) is in the best interest of the children. Under
Texas law, the “best interest of the child shall always be the primary consideration” in
determining conservatorship and access. Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002. If Mother wishes to
justify the highly restrictive temporary orders, she bears the burden to prove those orders
benefit the children. Yet she offers nothing of the sort. There is no expert testimony or
evaluation from a mental health professional supporting Mother’s position. There are no
statements from the children’s teachers or doctors, no school or medical records
indicating the children are better off under the current temporary arrangement. In fact,
Mother disobeyed a court-ordered parenting course (which was meant to help the
children cope with the family situation), demonstrating a disregard for the children’s best
interests. By contrast, Respondent has continually asserted that removing the children
from their father and home has been harmful to them, and Mother’s own evidence
inadvertently supports Respondent’s concerns. For example, in one of the text/email
exhibits attached to her response, Father poignantly points out that one daughter was
coming to his house in distress (asking for a diaper at nearly 7 years old) and that the girls

have been prevented from even speaking with their father’s side of the family. He laments

that the one-sided temporary orders – “procured by deceit and fraud” – have damaged 
the girls’ status quo, and he implores Mother to consider the harm being caused. Rather 
than contradict Respondent, these communications corroborate that the current situation 
is unhealthy for the children and was imposed without proper basis. Mother has simply 
no evidence to affirmatively show that keeping Father out of the home and on a 
supervised or restricted schedule is in the children’s best interest. All she offers is the 
refrain that “best interest” is paramount (which is true) and her own speculation that her 
custody demands should be litigated. Speculation is not evidence. Because Mother has 
not met her burden to produce evidence that the temporary orders’ onerous terms benefit 
the children, this element likewise yields to summary judgment. The Court should not 
allow baseless temporary orders to continue when they lack evidentiary support and, in 
fact, appear to be hurting the children more than helping. 
vi. No Evidence that Respondent Violated Court Orders in Any Material Way: In an 
effort to smear Respondent, Mother’s response accuses him of various violations of court 
orders and bad acts (harassment via messages, etc.), but again she roffers no concrete 
evidence of any meaningful violation. The record reflects that Respondent, though 
understandably frustrated by being ousted from his home and limited in access to his 
children, largely complied with the temporary orders to avoid further conflict. Mother’s 
exhibits include a series of text messages and emails from Respondent – yet these 
actually serve to validate Respondent’s position rather than prove willful misconduct. 
For instance, in the December 19, 2024, email chain that Mother herself submitted, 
Respondent addresses Mother’s failure to follow the temporary orders (not informing him 
directly of a child’s medical needs, not facilitating communication, etc.). He expresses

anguish at how the orders are being used as a sword against him and how he will seek to 
rectify the situation through the legal process. While the tone of these communications is 
urgent and upset, they do not evidence any threats or violence by Respondent; rather, 
they show a father reacting to Mother’s bad-faith litigation tactics and the distress they 
caused. Mother has presented no evidence that Respondent ever harmed the children or 
violated any court order in a manner that endangered anyone. There is no contempt order, 
no enforcement proceeding with findings against Respondent, nothing beyond Mother’s 
complaints. Minor technical violations (if any) or angry words in communications do not 
rise to the level of creating a genuine fact issue on any claim in this case. To defeat 
summary judgment, Mother needed to present admissible proof that Respondent 
breached a legal duty or order in a way that supports a cause of action or her requested 
relief. She has not done so. In the absence of any evidence of significant misconduct by 
Respondent, Mother cannot avoid summary dismissal of her allegations of harassment or 
other wrongdoing.

In sum, Mother failed to carry her burden on each and every one of the challenged 
elements. Each of the above issues is something for which Mother would bear the burden of 
proof at trial, yet after ample time for discovery she has “adduced nothing – no documents, 
no affidavits, no testimony” to support them. Her response is built on accusations, not evidence. 
Under Rule 166a(i), “the court must grant” the motion if the non-movant fails to bring forth 
more than a scintilla of evidence on the challenged elements. That is precisely the situation here.

Interrogatories, and Requests for Production aimed at uncovering any factual support for 
Mother’s claims. Mother did not respond within the time required by the Texas Rules of Civil 
Procedure. By rule, each Request for Admission she left unanswered is automatically deemed 
admitted. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 198.2(c); Marshall v. Vise, 767 S.W.2d 699, 700 (Tex. 1989) 
(unanswered requests are deemed admitted by operation of law). These deemed admissions are 
binding judicial admissions – Mother cannot introduce evidence to contradict them. Marshall, 
767 S.W.2d at 700; Sherman Acquisition II LP v. Garcia, 229 S.W.3d 802, 812 (Tex. App.—
Waco 2007,  no pet.) Moreover, deemed admissions are fully competent summary judgment

In this case, the deemed admissions effectively negate Mother’s causes of action.
Although the admissions themselves are in the record, a few examples are illustrative 
(paraphrasing due to their admitted status): Mother has admitted she has no evidence of physical 
abuse by Respondent; admitted that no protective order was ever issued; admitted that 
Respondent did not breach any court order in a manner harming the children; and admitted that 
she withdrew funds around the time of filing while claiming indigence. These admissions align 
with the no-evidence points discussed above, and Mother never sought to withdraw or amend 
them. Thus, even if Mother’s late affidavit could be considered, it cannot create a fact issue in 
the face of her own conclusive admissions to the contrary Beasley v. Burns, 7 S.W.3d 768,  769-
70 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 1999, pet. denied). The Court is entitled to rely on the deemed 
admissions as undisputed facts establishing that Mother lacks evidence for her claims. In short,

VII. Mother’s Second Amended Petition filed November 24, 2025, Contradicts the March
14, Temporary Orders, that claim to be in the Children’s Best Interests 
51. 
It is also noteworthy that Mother’s live pleadings in this case do not square with her 
position in this summary judgment proceeding. In her Second Amended Petition for Divorce, 
filed yesterday, Mother asserts claims and requests relief that cannot be reconciled with the 
premise that the February 1, 2024 Temporary Orders are valid and in the children’s best interest. 
For example, upon information and belief, Mother’s Second Amended Petition omits the family-
violence allegations that originally underpinned the ex parte temporary restraining order and 
protective order application. She instead pleads primarily “no-fault” divorce grounds, 
suggesting that the marriage is insupportable – a stance at odds with her current portrayal of 
Respondent as an abuser. Likewise, while the Temporary Orders reflect an agreement (on paper) 
to joint managing conservatorship with standard possession, Mother’s amended petition now 
seeks to modify or overturn those terms (e.g. by requesting sole managing conservatorship or 
supervised access by Father) due to alleged misconduct. Mother cannot have it both ways. If the 
temporary orders were truly agreed and in the children’s best interest (as she claims when it suits 
her), one would expect her live petition to mirror that status quo going forward. Instead, her 
Second Amended Petition attempts to dramatically change the custodial arrangement and 
revisit issues supposedly settled by the temporary orders. This inconsistency undermines 
Mother’s credibility and the integrity of her claims. It appears Mother values the temporary 
orders only as a tactical weapon to keep Respondent out of the home during the case, even as she 
signals an intention to seek different relief at final trial. The Court should not credit arguments 
that the temporary orders must stand, when Mother’s own pleadings cast doubt on their propriety 
and continued viability. This conflict in positions further confirms that the temporary orders were 
a product of strategic maneuvering rather than a fair, evidence-based resolution. As documented

in the Second Amended Consolidated Mandamus Record filed in the Texas Supreme Court, 
the chronology of events and Mother’s shifting litigation posture remain undisputed by her. In 
light of the record as a whole, Mother’s claims have no firm footing in fact or law. 
VIII. Respondent’s Communications Highlight Petitioner’s Bad Faith
52. 
Mother’s response includes various text messages and emails – presumably to paint 
Respondent in a poor light – but these actually support Respondent’s case and expose 
Petitioner’s bad faith. The communications show a Father desperate to maintain contact with his 
children and frustrated by Mother’s selective adherence to court orders. In one December 2024 
email, for instance, Respondent admonishes Mother for “hid[ing] behind” the one-sided orders 
while failing to follow them herself. He notes that Mother was preventing the children from even 
speaking to their family (violating the spirit of co-parenting) and points out that if Mother insists 
on using the orders as a shield, she should at least honor all provisions of those orders. Tellingly, 
Respondent accuses Mother of fabricating her indigency (referring to the false affidavit she 
filed) and of procuring the temporary orders “by deceit and fraud,” with the assistance of her 
counsel. Far from being off-topic rants, these statements directly align with Respondent’s legal 
position: that Mother misled the court to gain unfair advantage and has not acted in the children’s 
best interests. Respondent’s passionate tone is the understandable result of a parent who has been 
unjustly deprived of his home and children for an extended period. Importantly, nowhere in 
these communications does Respondent threaten harm or violate the law – he expressly says he 
will “pursue litigation” and hold those responsible accountable “in accordance with the law.” 
These messages, therefore, do not create any genuine dispute of material fact; if anything, they 
corroborate Respondent’s claims of procedural wrongdoing by Petitioner and the deleterious 
effect of Petitioner’s actions on the family. The Court should see Mother’s exhibit evidence for

Respondent’s understandable anger. Such distractions do not defeat a summary judgment motion. 
As one Texas court has noted, context matters – communications made in the midst of 
contentious litigation can reflect distress rather than culpability. Here, the context of 
Respondent’s messages is a father’s distress caused by Mother’s bad-faith tactics, and that 
context reinforces the justness of granting relief to Respondent.\ 
IX. Conclusion and Prayer
53. 
Mother has had ample time and opportunity to develop her case, but chose not to 
participate in the discovery process. She has come up with nothing of substance. The law is 
clear: when a claimant produces no evidence to support essential elements of her claims, “the 
court must grant the motion” for no-evidence summary judgment. Mother’s response falls far 
short of the mark – it is a compilation of excuses, contradictions, and unproven allegations 
dumped on the Court at the last minute. She asks the Court to ignore the rules of evidence and 
procedure and allow her claims to proceed on mere sympathy or speculation. But Rule 166a(i) 
was designed precisely to prevent that scenario and to dispose of baseless claims before they 
consume more time and resources. Courts in Texas (including in family law matters) do not 
hesitate to summarily dismiss claims when no proof supports them. This case is a textbook 
example of one that should be disposed of now: Mother’s extreme allegations (family violence, 
etc.) remain unsubstantiated, and every objective indicator in the record shows there is no 
genuine fact issue for trial.
