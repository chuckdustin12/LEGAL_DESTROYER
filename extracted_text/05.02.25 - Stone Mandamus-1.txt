Statement of the Case 
 
Nature of Underlying Proceeding: This original SAPCR was initiated to escape a 
dormant divorce suit to obtain emergency relief for the children named in this 
matter on March 19, 2025. There is a closely related case before this court (25-
0361) that spells out the series of events leading up to the facts supporting this 
Mandamus petition. The Second Court of Appeals denied mandamus relief on 
April 11, 2025, and denied En Banc Reconsideration on May 1, 2025. This 
Mandamus followed. 
 
Respondent Judge: The Respondent Judge, Honorable Kate Stone, is the 
presiding Associate Judge of the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County, Texas. Her 
office is located at Family Law Center 200 E. Weatherford St. 5th Floor, Fort 
Worth, TX 76196-0230. 
 
Respondent’s Challenged Inaction: On March 28,2025, the Respondent refused 
to hear the Relator’s properly filed emergency TRO and turned him away from the 
courtroom. Three weeks later, the emergency materialized, resulting in a dental 
emergency sustained by the youngest child named in this matter.

Did the Respondent Judge clearly abuse her discretion by refusing to hear or rule 
upon Relator’s properly filed emergency motion, thereby failing to perform a 
ministerial duty and leaving the Relator without an adequate appellate remedy? 
Issue No. 2: 
Does the pattern of judicial inaction in this case, including the appellate court’s 
unexplained denial of relief, warrant intervention by this Court to uphold due 
process, protect fundamental parental rights, and maintain public confidence in the 
judiciary?

PRIOR STATEMENT OF FACTS INCORPORATED 
Relator incorporates the statement of facts, mandamus record, and appendix 
filed in the Petition for Writ of Mandamus (02-25-00164-CV) which was denied 
per curiam on April 11, 2025, and again on May 1, 2025, by the Second Court of 
Appeals. 
STATEMENT OF FACTS 
There is a broader systemic issue facing the Texas judiciary that warrants this 
Court’s careful attention. In 2020, an analysis by the Texas Home School Coalition 
reviewed all Texas appellate cases involving parental-presumption challenges 
(post-Troxel v. Granville) and found courts “failed to protect parents’ constitutional 
rights more than 78% of the time” in certain contested suits.1 That report warned of 
a “systematic trampling” of parental rights. In practical terms, family courts have 
been accused of issuing temporary orders that strip parents of custody or visitation 
rights without the evidentiary safeguards or signed findings usually mandated by 
statute (e.g. without findings on endangerment or notice of rights). Such patterns of 
perceived overreach erode trust: if parents feel judges routinely ignore law and 
deny due process, confidence in “fairness” drops.  
In late 2023 this Court agreed to review Stary v. Ethridge, a case where a 
mother received a lifetime protective order barring contact with her children,

though her parental rights had not been terminated. The Stary case highlights due-
process concerns: critics note that standard protective-order proceedings use a lower 
evidentiary standard (preponderance) and do not include termination-like warnings 
or appointed counsel. In Stary, what began as a temporary ex-parte order became a 
permanent ban without a termination hearing. The appeal argues this is effectively a 
hidden termination of parental rights without the stringent safeguards (clear-and-
convincing evidence, written findings) normally required. Such high-profile 
instances—where a parent loses access permanently, yet no termination suit is ever 
filed—raise alarm among family law observers and fuel public anxiety that courts 
may be misusing protective orders to sidestep due process. 
Texas has enjoyed above-50% confidence in courts for decades (52% in 1998, 
60% in 2018) However, recent signals point downward. National polls (Gallup, 
NCSC) and Texas legislative testimony suggest current trust/satisfaction is 
significantly lower – in the mid-40s to 50s percentage range.2 High-profile cases 
(like Stary) and media reports (e.g. the ACLU’s Jackson case) highlight these 
problems, reinforcing the perception that Texas family courts sometimes act without 
accountability. 
In this case, the problem rests with the judiciary itself. The important question 
here is whether this Court will act and address the issues presented below.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Justice dies in silence. For fourteen months, this father has shouted into 
judicial chambers only to receive echoes of inaction and per curiam denials devoid 
of explanation. This is no ordinary dispute—it is a test of judicial integrity. When a 
trial court abdicates its duty and appellate courts hide behind unexplained refusals 
to intervene, the system itself fractures. 
The issues presented go beyond the merits of a single mandamus petition. 
The record speaks loudly and clearly for itself. But the deeper wound here is 
systemic: a court system that permits fundamental rights—parental rights at the 
core of our constitutional values—to be stripped without notice, hearing, or 
statutory findings, undermines the rule of law itself. See 25-0361. 
The silence of these courts does more than compound procedural errors. It 
emboldens litigants who exploit judicial complacency, incentivizes deceitful 
pleadings, and breeds public distrust. Worse, it leaves vulnerable children trapped 
in uncertainty, becoming collateral damage in a legal system that has lost sight of 
its purpose. 
This case demands attention—not merely for the rights of one father, but for 
the legitimacy and accountability of Texas courts as protectors of the most sacred 
relationships and freedoms we possess. The refusal to act by the courts below have 
resulted in a direct injury to the child which could have been prevented.

Justice dies in silence. For fourteen months, this father has shouted into

ARGUMENT 
A. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy, reserved for situations where a trial 
court clearly abuses its discretion and no adequate remedy by appeal exists. In re 
Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 135–36 (Tex. 2004). A core principle 
underpinning mandamus relief is the obligation of a trial court to act on matters 
properly brought before it. When a motion, such as Relator’s emergency request for 
a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), has been properly filed and presented to the 
trial court, the act of considering and ruling upon that motion is not discretionary; it 
is ministerial in nature. See In re Layton, 257 S.W.3d 794, 795 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 
2008, orig. proceeding) ("When a motion is properly filed and pending before a trial 
court, the act of considering and ruling upon that motion is a ministerial duty."). 
Mandamus is the appropriate mechanism to compel a trial court to fulfill this 
fundamental duty. Id. Furthermore, fundamental due process, enshrined in both the 
U.S. and Texas Constitutions, demands that parties be afforded a meaningful 
opportunity to be heard before a court grants or denies relief, particularly when 
fundamental rights like parenting are implicated. Creel v. District Atty. for Medina

ARGUMENT

A. STANDARD OF REVIEW

Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy, reserved for situations where a trial
court clearly abuses its discretion and no adequate remedy by appeal exists. Jn re
Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 135-36 (Tex. 2004). A core principle
underpinning mandamus relief is the obligation of a trial court to act on matters
properly brought before it. When a motion, such as Relator’s emergency request for
a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), has been properly filed and presented to the
trial court, the act of considering and ruling upon that motion is not discretionary; it
is ministerial in nature. See Jn re Layton, 257 S.W.3d 794, 795 (Tex. App.—Amarillo
2008, orig. proceeding) ("When a motion is properly filed and pending before a trial
court, the act of considering and ruling upon that motion is a ministerial duty.").
Mandamus is the appropriate mechanism to compel a trial court to fulfill this
fundamental duty. Jd. Furthermore, fundamental due process, enshrined in both the
U.S. and Texas Constitutions, demands that parties be afforded a meaningful
opportunity to be heard before a court grants or denies relief, particularly when
fundamental rights like parenting are implicated. Creel v. District Atty. for Medina
County, 818 S.W.2d 45, 46 (Tex. 1991).

In this case, the record demonstrates that Relator properly filed and attempted

to present an emergency TRO concerning the safety and welfare of his child. The

Respondent Judge, however, refused even to hear the matter, turning the Relator 
away from the courtroom on March 28, 2025. This outright refusal to consider a 
properly filed emergency motion constitutes a failure to perform a clear ministerial 
duty. As established in Layton, such inaction warrants mandamus relief. The 
subsequent denial of mandamus by the Second Court of Appeals, without 
explanation, effectively endorses this dereliction of duty, leaving Relator with no 
adequate remedy by appeal for the trial court's refusal to act on an urgent matter 
directly impacting child safety. 
B. JUDICIAL INACTION VIOLATES DUE PROCESS AND 
FUNDAMENTAL PARENTAL RIGHTS, RESULTING IN PREVENTABLE 
HARM 
 
The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids any State from 
depriving a person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. U.S. 
CONST. amend. XIV, § 1. This guarantee encompasses both procedural fairness and 
substantive protections against governmental infringement upon fundamental liberty 
interests. Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 301-02 (1993). Among the most fundamental 
liberty interests recognized by the Supreme Court is the right of parents to direct the 
upbringing and care of their children. Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 (2000). 
Texas law echoes these protections, mandating that the best interest of the child is 
the primary consideration in custody matters (Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002) and 
requiring procedural safeguards before parental rights are restricted.

Here, the Respondent Judge’s refusal to hear Relator’s emergency TRO on 
March 28, 2025, represents a profound violation of these constitutional and statutory 
mandates. By turning Relator away and failing even to schedule a hearing on his 
properly filed motion alleging imminent risk to his child, the court denied him the 
basic procedural due process required under Creel. This was not a mere delay; it was 
a complete denial of the opportunity to be heard on an emergency matter specifically 
provided for under the Texas Family Code (See Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001, 
authorizing temporary orders for child safety). While Texas law allows for ex parte 
TROs under certain urgent circumstances, it simultaneously requires that a hearing 
be set promptly, typically within 14 days (See TRCP 680), to ensure due process is 
ultimately satisfied. The Respondent’s refusal to even consider the TRO application 
flouted these principles entirely. 
This inaction occurred despite Relator presenting a justiciable emergency 
concerning his child's welfare. The court’s refusal stands in stark contrast to its 
apparent swiftness in acting upon the Real Party in Interest's initial application, 
which Relator contends was based on false pretenses. The court accepted that 
initial emergency filing seemingly without scrutiny, removing Relator from his 
home and restricting access to his children based on allegations later proven 
questionable, yet refused to even entertain Relator’s subsequent, legitimate

emergency concerning actual harm. This differential treatment further underscores 
the arbitrary nature of the refusal and the denial of equal protection. 
The consequences of this judicial dereliction were not hypothetical; they 
were tragically real. As Relator warned, the delay precipitated by the court's refusal 
to act allowed the foreseen harm to materialize: the youngest child suffered a 
preventable dental emergency requiring intervention. This direct injury, stemming 
from the court's failure to perform its ministerial duty to hear the emergency 
motion, highlights the inadequacy of any remedy other than mandamus. An appeal

message. Such inaction suggests the courthouse doors may be closed to those 
seeking urgent protection for children, potentially violating the Texas 
Constitution’s Open Courts Provision, which guarantees access to the courts for 
redress of injuries. Tex. Const. art. I, § 13. This apparent disregard for mandatory

fundamental principle that Texas courts must provide a meaningful forum for 
litigants, especially in emergencies involving child safety, and must perform their 
ministerial duties without bias or arbitrary refusal. The unexplained silence from 
the lower courts cannot substitute for adherence to the rule of law and undermines 
the public trust essential for the judiciary's legitimacy. Mandamus relief is essential 
to compel the Respondent Judge to fulfill her duty and to restore a measure of faith 
in the judicial process. 
CONCLUSION AND PRAYER 
This is not merely a dispute over procedural timelines; it is a plea for the 
enforcement of fundamental legal obligations and the protection of a children’s 
well-being. The Respondent Judge's refusal to even consider Relator's emergency 
motion, particularly when contrasted with the sister court's earlier actions from the 
sister court that removed Relator from his home based on false allegations, 
demands correction. The integrity of the judicial process requires that courts fulfill 
their basic duties, especially when immediate risks to children are alleged. Failure 
to do so constitutes a clear abuse of discretion warranting mandamus relief.  
Therefore, all premises considered, the Relator prays that this Honorable

APP 1.2
The children are suffering daily from their father being prevented
access to the marital home. The Respondent has prevented access
since March 6, 2024, knowing the Petitioner's need for the residence to work.
This has left the children without the care of either parent for the majority
of the time, and are being told that the divorce has been finalized
and that their father is a bad person.
Prior to the Respondent's removal, the Children were cared for both emotionally and financially by the Petitioner. The Respondent
knowingly and willingly sabotaged this relationship to further her own agenda with a separate relationship.
The emotional well-being and stability of the children have been destroyed, and their stable life has been dismantled
by the Respondent in bad faith. There exists no legal basis for the current situation to persist,
and the children are already showing signs of distress, emotional trauma, and are beginning to struggle academically.
The children need the Petitioner's stable, nurturing care during this difficult time, and they will soon lose all access to their Father who will be homless given the circumstances.
The Petitioner has been fighting for over a year to get back into his residence to no avail. The Respondent has refused to participate, and 
continues to prioritize her new relationship over the children. Notice would only spark more deceptive legal actions from the Respondent to try and subvert justice.
