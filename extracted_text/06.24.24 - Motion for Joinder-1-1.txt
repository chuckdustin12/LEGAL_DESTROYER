The actions by each named party herein resulted in the loss of the 
Respondent’s custodial rights, business, and property interests, and 
were initiated the weekend before Christmas void any legal basis for 
doing so. Respondent asserts that any reasonable finder of fact

all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and 
utterly intolerable in a civilized society." Hoffman-La Roche, Inc. v.

(1) the defendant acted intentionally or recklessly; (2) the defendant's
conduct was extreme and outrageous; (3) the conduct caused the
claimant emotional distress; and (4) the emotional distress was severe.
Tiller v. McLure, 121 S.W.3d 709, 713 (Tex. 2003) (per curiam);

Twyman v. Twyman, 855 S.W.2d 619, 621 (Tex. 1993).

All four elements of this cause of action have been satisfied here.
The actions by each named party herein resulted in the loss of the
Respondent’s custodial rights, business, and property interests, and
were initiated the weekend before Christmas void any legal basis for
doing so. Respondent asserts that any reasonable finder of fact
would conclude that the actions taken by the named parties are "so
outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond
all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and
utterly intolerable in a civilized society." Hoffman-La Roche, Inc. v.
Zeltwanger, 144 S.W.3d 438, 445 (Tex. 2004); see also Creditwatch,

VII. CRIMINAL CONDUCT

31. The admitted actions of Daniel Kenneth Branthoover and Morgan

have undermined this State’s interest in protecting the best interests
of the Children by deceiving this Court. The specific criminal

violations include:

a.
Daniel Kenneth Branthoover has impersonated a public
servant by presenting himself as an attorney and performed
legal acts without a license such as requesting discovery,
advising Morgan Michelle Myers to transfer the available
funds in the marital estate to herself, directly influenced the
pleadings in this case, and has caused significant and
ongoing harm on the Children and the Respondent in this
case. “A person commits an offense if they impersonate a
public servant with intent to induce another to submit to their
pretended official authority or to rely on their pretended
official acts. This offense is a felony of the third degree.”
Texas Penal Code § 37.11.
b. Morgan Michelle Myers knowingly and willingly filed
fraudulent divorce paperwork under the advice of Daniel
Branthoover “with intent to deceive and with knowledge of
the statement's meaning” when claiming an active order of
protection existed against the Respondent for the purpose of
acquiring property as well as when filing for a protective
order to achieve the same goal. Texas Penal Code § 32.32(b).
The goal was to gain an advantage in the divorce suit by
leveraging knowingly false statements of family violence
and by creating a false narrative of protection. An affidavit of
inability to pay was claimed despite both Daniel and Morgan

admitting via text evidence that Morgan had transferred 
money to herself just three days prior on December 15th, 
2024. 
c.
Both Morgan Michelle Myers and Daniel Kenneth
Branthoover knowingly and willingly committed acts of
perjury. The perjury occurred when they conspired to
transfer joint finances to Morgan through Daniel’s PayPal
account and immediately following this act proceeded to file
for divorce swearing an affidavit of inability to pay costs and
that an active order of protection existed against the
Respondent. This affidavit was made under oath with the
intent to deceive the court regarding her financial status, a
clear violation of Texas Penal Code § 37.02(a)(1).
VIII. CONCLUSION
32. The actions taken by Morgan Michelle Myers and Daniel Kenneth
Branthoover are not only legally reprehensible but also morally
indefensible. Their calculated scheme to remove the Respondent, a
dedicated stay-at-home father, from the lives of his children has
caused significant disruption. By conspiring to fraudulently transfer
joint finances, filing a deceitful affidavit of inability to pay costs,
and manipulating legal processes through perjury and
impersonation, they have engaged in a toxic and egregious civil

conspiracy, committed fraud, and destabilized the lives of the minor 
children of this case for the sole benefit of Morgan Michelle Myers. 
33. The Respondent has been the primary caregiver for his children,
providing them with emotional support and stability. The deliberate
efforts of Morgan and Daniel to sever this vital relationship have
disrupted the children's lives, depriving them of the love and care
they rely on, and the financial support they have enjoyed. This
malicious intent to manipulate the court and inflict harm on Charles
and his children cannot continue to be overlooked.
34. While Margie Evonne Wilson's actions contributed to the harm
caused, it is important to acknowledge that the Respondent does not
believe her intent was driven by malice. The Respondent believes
Margie was manipulated and placed in a difficult position by
Morgan. Her inclusion into the case is necessary for the relief being
sought regarding the preservation of the property and has expressed
shared concerns regarding the Children.
35. Given the severity of these actions, it is imperative that this Court
take decisive action. The Respondent respectfully requests that the
Court grant the relief sought, enjoin the responsible third parties,
and if deemed necessary - forward the information regarding the
criminal violations to the appropriate state prosecutors for further
investigation regarding Daniel Branthoover’s actions. The well-

36. While Morgan Michelle Myers has committed criminal offenses in
this State, the Respondent would request this court not pursue
criminal charges against her as it would not serve the best interests
of the Children.
37. Despite Daniel Branthoover’s residency residing in Oklahoma, this
court can exercise jurisdiction over him due to his direct
involvement and sufficient contacts with the State regarding his
influence and the damages caused by that influence.
XI. PRAYER AND RELIEF
29. Respondent requests the following relief:
1. Grant a temporary restraining order preventing Daniel Kenneth
Branthoover from being in the presence of the Respondent’s
children while the case is pending.
2. Require by order of this court that Daniel Kenneth Branthoover
pay monetary damages, which includes hotel bills, gas expenses
to exercise visitation, tolls, business income losses, and the
fraudulent transfer of marital assets.
3. Grant the Respondent a temporary injunction for the
preservation of the property while this case is pending to
preserve the status quo for the Children.
