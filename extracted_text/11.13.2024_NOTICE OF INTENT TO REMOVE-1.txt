Respondent, Relator, Defendant; representing himself in 
his own individual capacity as CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, hereby 
refrains from referring to himself in third person.  
I find it to be repugnant. In reality, I’m simply a 
father. A father who was brought into this situation during 
the most precious time of year.  Now, while I have the 
highest respect for the judiciary, this court, and all of 
its’ participants – today you have all left me scratching 
my head as to how after passing through two judges, a panel 
of three judges in the Second Court of Appeals followed by 
the entire court en banc, seven Justices at the highest 
level of the Texas judiciary, a regional presiding Judge, 
and a visiting retired Judge, in all of their collective 
experience, could not see the issues within this case. 
Perhaps most shocking is how after over 1,500 pages of 
documents, pictures, sworn statements, and most importantly 
– without any opposition or engagement with any part of it
from our friends on the other side, it’s not enough to
overcome the apparent, deep-seated antagonism that has only
left more questions unanswered and fraud unaddressed.

IT. INTRODUCTION

Respondent, Relator, Defendant; representing himself in
his own individual capacity as CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, hereby

refrains from referring to himself in third person.

I find it to be repugnant. In reality, I’m simply a
father. A father who was brought into this situation during
the most precious time of year. Now, while I have the
highest respect for the judiciary, this court, and all of
its” participants — today you have all left me scratching
my head as to how after passing through two judges, a panel
of three judges in the Second Court of Appeals followed by
the entire court en banc, seven Justices at the highest
level of the Texas judiciary, a regional presiding Judge,

and a visiting retired Judge, in all of their collective

experience, could not see the issues within this case.

Perhaps most shocking is how after over 1,500 pages of
documents, pictures, sworn statements, and most importantly
— without any opposition or engagement with any part of it
from our friends on the other side, it’s not enough to
overcome the apparent, deep-seated antagonism that has only

left more questions unanswered and fraud unaddressed-

I am here not out of disrespect, but because I was 
compelled to be here. I am not seeking the world from this 
court, only answers. The relief I seek is not that of 
impossibility – but is that which is enshrined in the most 
fundamental protections our country has to offer. It’s a 
relief that has been continuously denied time and time 
again, without any explanation.  
In fact, the latest denial actually makes the most 
sense out of any order issued so far in this case, so for 
that I am hopeful. However, the latest denial, albeit 
legally justified on face value, was made in error, and the 
only exhibit attached to this motion is the reasons why I 
believe this to be true.

II. ISSUE

A. EFM ISSUES PREVENTED THE FILING OF A CONTINUANCE

1. Exhibit A 1s attached hereto for the purpose of

2. These efforts only came second to the rules of law.
The inability to access the EFM at such a crucial juncture 
was communicated to the court and all parties relevant to 
the matter.  
3. Furthermore, the circumstances in this case have
left me in a persistent state of planning for an inevitable 
appeal, such as here, where a denial as issued at the first 
opportunity and allows the court to escape any explanation 
for the important questions being asked of it.  
4. Given that my access to the EFM was unavailable
during the crucial time that a sworn continuance should 
have been filed, it raises more questions which require 
answers to protect my rights that have been continuously 
violated. For example, given the circumstances, I can’t 
rely on the reason being a technicality regarding the EFM. 
B. THE DENIAL ONLY CREATES MORE UNADDRESSED ISSUES
5. The problem I have with this decision is that the
denial states that the opposing party appeared and that no 
evidence was admitted – but makes no mention of the 
agreement made by the parties, the circumstances, and as

mutual agreement, the opposing party showed up anyway and 
acted as if no agreement was made notwithstanding that it 
mentioned that she appeared by her attorney of record, 
which is currently under scrutiny and remains on the long 
list of unanswered questions. 
III. NO FURTHER STATE REMEDIES
7. After nearly eleven months of seeking answers, only more
questions have arisen.

given the circumstances pointed out, or in the alternative, 
adopt the still-pending motion to enter judgement and original, 
unmodified joint motion to recuse, it has the discretion to do 
so.

the ongoing constitutional issues that the State refuses to 
address.

Northern District of Texas pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a) 
and § 1441(c)(1)(A). Removal is sought on the basis of

negligence, and claims of unaddressed fraudulent actions by 
Plaintiff. Defendant submits the following in support of 
removal: 
A. Federal Question Jurisdiction Due to Violations of Due
Process Rights
15. This case raises significant federal questions
under the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, 
specifically regarding Defendant’s right to due process. 
Defendant asserts that his due process rights have been 
repeatedly violated due to procedural negligence by the 
state court and the imposition of an agreement that was 
obtained through fraudulent claims by Plaintiff, without 
proper judicial scrutiny or procedural safeguards. The

state court has taken actions that have fundamentally 
deprived Defendant of a fair opportunity to present his 
case, as evidenced by the following: 
i. Plaintiff’s initial claims, including the
unsubstantiated allegation of an active protective 
order, were not subjected to adequate evidentiary 
review or discovery. Instead, these claims were used to 
pressure Defendant into a settlement agreement that has 
since been revealed to be grounded in 
misrepresentation. The lack of judicial oversight in 
this process has effectively deprived Defendant of the 
ability to defend his rights and property, constituting 
a direct violation of due process. 
ii. The state court compelled Defendant to accept
and sign a settlement agreement that Plaintiff obtained 
through alleged fraudulent representations. When 
Defendant contested the validity of this agreement, the 
court disregarded his objections and ordered him to 
comply without further review. This compelled 
compliance without scrutiny or due process fails to

17. Upon filing the Joint Motion to Recuse, the court
chose to stop recording the pleadings on the EFM, chose ot 
modify the Defendant’s documents upon forwarding them to 
the 8th Administrative Regional Judge, and the state court 
issued an erroneous denial, as outlined in Exhibit 1, 
without proper judicial scrutiny of either the situation or 
the issues at hand, choosing to leave them unaddressed. 
This denial is indicative of the court’s unwillingness to 
engage with the core issues of fraud and due process 
violations that affect Defendant’s rights and has left 
Defendant with no adequate remedy at the state level. 
18. The state court’s avoidance of key claims—such as
Plaintiff’s conversion of marital assets, her perjurious 
statements, and intentional destruction of community 
property—has further deprived Defendant of the opportunity 
to have these matters fairly adjudicated. Defendant 
contends that these fraudulent actions go directly to the 
heart of his claims and that the state court’s avoidance of 
these matters amounts to a failure of procedural justice.

This avoidance underscores the need for federal 
intervention, as the state court has failed to uphold 
Defendant’s right to due process and a fair hearing. 
C. Domestic Relations Exception Does Not Apply
19. The Domestic Relations Exception does not bar
federal jurisdiction in this case, as Defendant is not 
seeking federal court adjudication of traditional family 
law issues such as divorce or custody. Rather, this removal 
is sought to address alleged due process violations, 
fraudulent claims, and procedural negligence that have 
deprived Defendant of his federally protected rights. 
Defendant seeks federal review to rectify the imposition of 
a fraudulent settlement agreement that was coerced through 
misrepresentation, extending beyond the traditional 
boundaries of domestic relations issues. Therefore, the 
Domestic Relations Exception does not apply to preclude 
federal review of the due process violations and fraudulent 
actions central to this case.

All current orders remain interlocutory, and Defendant is 
not seeking to challenge any final state court decision. 
Defendant’s removal is based on the need for federal review 
of ongoing procedural violations and due process issues 
that have not yet reached final adjudication in the state 
court. Since there is no final judgment, the Rooker-Feldman 
Doctrine does not apply to prevent federal intervention in 
this matter. 
E. Younger Abstention Doctrine Does Not Apply
21. The Younger Abstention Doctrine generally bars
federal intervention in active state proceedings. However, 
it does not apply here because Defendant is not attempting 
to disrupt the state court’s core jurisdiction over family 
law matters. Instead, Defendant seeks federal review due to 
ongoing procedural violations and unaddressed fraudulent 
actions by Plaintiff, which infringe upon Defendant’s 
federal rights. Federal oversight is necessary to ensure 
the protection of Defendant’s due process rights and to 
address the state court’s failure to enforce procedural 
safeguards or address Plaintiff’s fraudulent actions.

F. Ambiguity and Procedural Gaps Allow Removal Beyond the
30-Day Window
22. The ongoing procedural ambiguity and lack of
resolution in the state proceedings justify removal beyond 
the standard 30-day window. The state court’s failure to 
scrutinize Plaintiff’s claims, enforce discovery, or 
provide clarifying documentation has created substantial 
ambiguity about the true basis for Plaintiff’s allegations 
and the validity of the coerced settlement agreement. This 
ambiguity effectively extends the removal window, as 
Defendant has not received adequate information to properly 
address these ambiguous and procedurally flawed claims. 
23. Plaintiff’s initial pleadings contain
unsubstantiated claims impacting Defendant’s rights, and 
the state court’s failure to require discovery has 
prevented Defendant from understanding the basis for these 
claims. Due to the state court’s lack of procedural 
enforcement and transparency, Defendant’s right to remove 
remains valid until clarification and compliance with 
procedural standards are achieved.

F. Ambiguity and Procedural Gaps Allow Removal Beyond the

30-Day Window

22. The ongoing procedural ambiguity and lack of
resolution in the state proceedings justify removal beyond
the standard 30-day window. The state court’s failure to
scrutinize Plaintiff’s claims, enforce discovery, or
provide clarifying documentation has created substantial
ambiguity about the true basis for Plaintiff’s allegations
and the validity of the coerced settlement agreement. This
ambiguity effectively extends the removal window, as
Defendant has not received adequate information to properly

address these ambiguous and procedurally flawed claims~

23. Plaintiff’s initial pleadings contain
unsubstantiated claims impacting Defendant’s rights, and
the state court’s failure to require discovery has
prevented Defendant from understanding the basis for these
claims. Due to the state court’s lack of procedural
enforcement and transparency, Defendant’s right to remove
remains valid until clarification and compliance with

procedural standards are achieved.

24. Additionally, Defendant notes that the state court
has the discretion to reconsider its prior denial, as it 
has not been formally served in compliance with Texas Rules 
of Civil Procedure 21a and showcases an unwillingness to 
address the issues herein. Should the court choose not to 
reconsider its prior ruling, Defendant intends to exercise 
his right to remove the case to federal court upon receipt 
of the denial, as outlined in the present notice, pursue 
relief from damages from Plaintiff. 
V. CONCLUSION AND PRAYER
In the instant case, the troubling reality of the 
court’s initial decision will bear a lifetime of 
consequence on the lives of the children it has left out of 
the equation.  
Given the significant procedural and factual issues in this 
case, Respondent respectfully requests the Court adopt one 
of the following remedies to ensure a fair and just 
outcome: 
1. Recuse Judges James Munford and Jeffrey Kaitcer from
further proceedings, or:

Granting either of these alternatives would allow the 
Court to rectify the underlying concerns of procedural 
fairness, ensuring that the children’s welfare and

The issues in this case can be corrected just as 
swiftly as they were created. It is here, at the threshold 
of justice, that the court must exercise its’ discretion to 
correct these grave mistakes to prevent further escalation.
