("e-filing")
in

cases,
including
family
and
probate
cases,
by
attorneys
in
appellate
courts,

constitutional county courts, and statutory probate courts pursuant to a detailed implementation
schedule.

require
the
exchange

of that
exchange has been paper.
Texas courts have
struggled for over a century to process, manage,
and
store
court documents.
With the
information age,
it
is now possible
to
receive and
store
those documents digitally.
Texas courts
first experimented with this new medium in the
1990s
when
two
district
courts
urged
lawyers
to
file
documents
electronically.
The
benefits
were
immediate.
With
electronic
filing,

expenses
decreased
dramatically.
Clerks
that
formerly spent time sorting and file-stamping documents could be assigned to more productive
activities.
Documents were no longer damaged or lost.
The public, lawyers, and judges could
instantly
access
vital

accelerating
the
progress
of
litigation.
These
efficiencies
prompted the judiciary to
initiate a pilot project in January 2003
to
test and refine the
e-filing
model.
That model was
instituted
statewide
in 2004 through the
state's

ORDER REQUIRING
ELECTRONIC FILING IN CERTAIN COURTS

This order mandates electronic filing (“e-filing’) in civil cases, including family and
probate cases, by attorneys in appellate courts, district courts, statutory county courts,
constitutional county courts, and statutory probate courts pursuant to a detailed implementation
schedule.

Disputes in court require the exchange of information. The primary medium of that
exchange has been paper. Texas courts have struggled for over a century to process, manage,
and store court documents. With the information age, it is now possible to receive and store
those documents digitally. Texas courts first experimented with this new medium in the 1990s
when two district courts urged lawyers to file documents electronically. The benefits were

formerly spent time sorting and file-stamping documents could be assigned to more productive
activities. Documents were no longer damaged or lost. The public, lawyers, and judges could
instantly access vital pleadings, accelerating the progress of litigation. These efficiencies
prompted the judiciary to initiate a pilot project in January 2003 to test and refine the e-filing
model. That model was instituted statewide in 2004 through the state’s Texas.gov’ internet
portal. Since that time, a growing number of trial and appellate courts have implemented e-
filing.

Currently, the following courts in Texas accept e-filing:

•
236 district courts and 81
county courts covering 51
counties and more than 80% of
the state's population (mandatory in a few district courts);
•
7 statutory probate courts covering 7 counties; and
•
28 justice courts covering 12 counties.
While most of these courts have accepted e-filings through the Texas.gov portal, several
courts have adopted systems that diverge from the Supreme
Court's
e-filing exemplar.
As a
result,
Texas
litigants
and
attorneys
confront
several
different
systems
and must
master
the
requirements
for
each.
Without
a
centralized
and
uniform
portal
for
accessing
court
case
information, the advantages of filing electronically are greatly diminished.
The federal courts, including the bankruptcy courts, district courts and courts of appeals,
offer e-filing through a unified, nationwide system, and most of those courts require lawyers to
file electronically.
Twenty-three states mandate e-filing to varying degrees. These courts have
reported dramatic improvements in efficiency and decreased costs.
This
Court
convened
a
hearing
on
December
8,
2011,
to
assess
the
benefits
and
drawbacks of creating a uniform statewide e-filing system.
The Court received testimony from
the Chair of the Judicial Committee on Information Technology,
a district judge,
four
district
clerks,
a
representative
of the
current
e-filing
vendor,
a
representative
of an
e-filing
service
provider
and
a
law
firm
technology
officer.
The
Court
also
received
numerous
written
comments.
Almost
all
of the
individuals who
testified
at
that hearing and
submitted
written
comments supported mandatory e-filing and implementation of a uniform statewide system.
The testimony revealed a number of benefits to e-filing in Texas courts, including quicker
access to e-filed documents; increased efficiency for attorneys and litigants; reduced printing and
mailing
costs
for attorneys and
litigants;
reduced
storage
costs
for
clerks;
greater
security of
court documents in the event of disaster; more efficient use of court staff, as employees typically
assigned to accept documents
at the
clerk's
office counter can be
retrained
for higher skilled
positions; and increased transparency and access to the
courts.
Information can
generally be
found more
quickly
in an
e-filed document because
of the
capacity
to
search
for words
and
phrases.
Documents
can
also
be
easily
cross-referenced
and
hyperlinks
can
facilitate
direct
citation to other filings, legal databases, and exhibits.
All of this enhances the quality of legal
advocacy and the quantity of information the tribunal possesses when deciding the case.
The testimony also revealed a number of concerns,
including the high cost of e-filing
associated with the "toll-road" structure of the current system, which requires litigants to pay a
fee each time a document is e-filed; the current system's inability to allow certain government
and indigent filers to e-file documents at no cost; the decentralized nature of the current system
Government filers referenced here are those which are not statutorily required to pay filing fees.

and accompanying local e-filing rules; and the inability of the current technology to handle an
increase in filings.
While
considering
the
information received
at the
hearing,
the
Court
learned
that the
vendor who managed the Texas.gov system would not renew its contract.
Accordingly, unless
appropriate measures were taken, e-filing would expire in Texas in August 2012.3
The Court,
the
Judicial
Committee on Information Technology
("JCIT"),
the
Department of Information
Resources, and others determined that it would be prudent to seek a new vendor.
The Office of
Court Administration ("OCA") procured and recently signed a contract with a new vendor to
provide
e-filing
to
all
Texas
courts
through
a
system
called
"TexFile."
The
TexFile
system
follows the "toll road" model, but drastically reduces4 the cost of e-filing and electronic service.
To further reduce costs, OCA and the Court continue to pursue alternative funding models for
the new system.
In support of these efforts, the Texas Judicial Council has requested that the
Texas Legislature lower e-filing fees by adopting a one-time, per-case e-filing fee to replace the
"toll-road" model's per-document or per-transaction fee.5
TexFile will also permit indigent and
certain
government
filers
to
submit
documents
at no
cost.
Finally,
the new system
will
be
scalable to handle as many filings as necessary and will allow for better integration with existing
case management software in the courts.
This
Court
relies
on
JCIT
to
develop
policy
recommendations
for
the
Judiciary
on
matters relating to technology.
JCIT has spent the
last several years evaluating the existing e-
filing
structure and
determining how
to
improve
service
to
the
courts
and
citizens of Texas.
After much study, JCIT recommended that the Court "mandate a statewide, uniform system of e-
filing for all courts with a phased implementation starting with the most populous counties."
After considering the testimony, both oral and written, provided at the Court's hearing,
along
with
the
recommendations
of JCIT
regarding
e-filing,
the
Supreme
Court
of Texas
concludes
that
mandatory
e-filing
in
civil
cases
will
promote
the
efficient
and
uniform
administration of justice in Texas courts.
Accordingly, it is ORDERED that:
1.
This Order governs e-filing in all civil cases, including family and probate cases,
at the
Supreme
Court
of Texas,
courts
of
appeals,
district
courts,
statutory
county
courts,
constitutional county courts, and statutory probate courts.
An eighteen month extension was negotiated between DIR and the current vendor to allow for a transition to a
new vendor.
4 The e-filing fees are reduced by up to 48 percent under the new contract.
With additional filing volume, the e-
filing fees could be reduced by up to 66 percent.
