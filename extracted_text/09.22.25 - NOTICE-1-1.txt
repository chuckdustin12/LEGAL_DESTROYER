I. INTRODUCTION 
 
1. The critical issue in this matter is whether Judge Munford, Judge Kaitcer, and 
coordinator Baker are willing participants in the affairs of the enterprise, as opposed to 
inadvertent or unwitting actors. The key fact here is that Baker, Judge Kaitcer, and Myers all 
signed a court order that expressly stated the court had reviewed all evidence and pleadings, 
including a motion that specifically warned of the existence and conduct of the Myers-
Branthoover enterprise (REC. 888). By signing this order, they acknowledged awareness of the 
scheme and chose to enforce an order that furthered the enterprise’s objectives—namely, 
awarding Myers the home and causing ongoing business harm to the Plaintiff.

TO THE 322%” DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS:

Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, hereby provides this notice to the court
and relevant parties of the following:
I. INTRODUCTION

1. The critical issue in this matter is whether Judge Munford, Judge Kaitcer, and
coordinator Baker are willing participants in the affairs of the enterprise, as opposed to
inadvertent or unwitting actors. The key fact here is that Baker, Judge Kaitcer, and Myers all
signed a court order that expressly stated the court had reviewed all evidence and pleadings,
including a motion that specifically warned of the existence and conduct of the Myers-
Branthoover enterprise (REC. 888). By signing this order, they acknowledged awareness of the
scheme and chose to enforce an order that furthered the enterprise’s objectives—namely,

awarding Myers the home and causing ongoing business harm to the Plaintiff.

2. Fifth Circuit authority holds that, for a RICO conspiracy conviction, there must be 
evidence that the defendants manifested an agreement to participate in the enterprise’s affairs 
through predicate crimes (U.S. v. Stratton, 649 F.2d 1066, 1074 (5th Cir. 1981)). This agreement 
can be inferred from circumstantial evidence, such as the defendants’ acts and conduct. Here, the 
act of signing an order that explicitly acknowledges review of all evidence—including a motion 
warning of the fraudulent enterprise—constitutes objective evidence of agreement to further the 
enterprise’s goals. 
 
3. Moreover, the Fifth Circuit has made clear that both insiders and outsiders associated 
with an enterprise can be held liable if they participate, directly or indirectly, in the enterprise’s 
affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity (U.S. v. Elliott, 571 F.2d 880, 902 (5th Cir. 
1978)). Direct evidence of agreement is not necessary; participation can be inferred from 
circumstantial evidence, such as the signing of an order that furthers the enterprise’s objectives 
after being put on notice of the scheme. 
 
4. The timeline and factual allegations demonstrate that Judge Munford, Judge Kaitcer, 
and Myers are not merely passive actors or inadvertent participants. After being put on notice of 
the fraudulent scheme through a motion that detailed the Myers-Branthoover enterprise, several 
mandamus petitions, and subsequent documents - they nonetheless signed and enforced an order 
that furthered the enterprise’s objectives. This conduct goes beyond mere negligence or 
inadvertence; it reflects a conscious decision to participate in the enterprise’s affairs. 
 
5. The Fifth Circuit’s standard for RICO conspiracy liability is satisfied where two or 
more people agree to commit a substantive RICO offense and the defendant knows of and agrees 
to the overall objective of the RICO offense (United States v. Rosenthal, 805 F.3d 523, 530 (5th 
Cir. 2015)). Here, the defendants’ actions—signing an order that acknowledges review of all

evidence, including explicit warnings of the enterprise—demonstrate knowledge of and 
agreement to the enterprise’s objectives. 
 
6. Furthermore, the requirement that the racketeering activities “advance” or “further” the 
interests of the enterprise is met, as the defendants’ actions had a direct impact on the enterprise’s 
goals by depriving the Respondent of his home and business (U.S. v. Dozier, 672 F.2d 531, 544 
(5th Cir. 1982)). 
 
7. Finally, Respondent asserts that judicial immunity and quasi-judicial immunity, the 
only viable defense for some defendants, will be attacked on the basis of the narrow exception 
that the law provides. 
II. RECOMMENDED ACTIONS 
 
8. Nevertheless, Respondent reminds this Court that it has not only the discretion, but the 
duty to hold a hearing at the earliest opportunity as to why this case should not be dismissed for 
want of prosecution, or through the court’s inherent power. 
 
9. This rationale is supported in several ways, including but not limited to: 
 
 
 
a.  
The Petitioner’s affidavit of inability to pay is facially fraudulent,  
 
 
 
 
as stated throughout the record, giving this court the discretion to  
 
 
 
 
dismiss the case pursuant to Section 13.001 of the Texas Practice  
 
 
 
 
and Remedies Code. 
 
 
 
b.  
The opposing counsel has not participated in this matter. Instead of 
 
 
 
 
setting the matter for final trial and exposing the court to liability,

III. CONCLUSION 
 
9. In summary, by ignoring these issues, the Court, despite having the discretion to 
dismiss this case for the reasons stated above, continues to further the affairs of the enterprise, 
pointing to a willful participation to achieve a common goal: obtain a final decree of divorce for 
Morgan Michelle Myers. 
 
10. Accordingly, this Court must weigh its’ options, as this notice was provided in good 
faith to promote judicial efficiency and prevent future waste of judicial resources.
