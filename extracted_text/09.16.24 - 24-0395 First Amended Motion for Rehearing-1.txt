INTRODUCTION 
The law is a remarkable institution, built to evolve, adapt, and ensure that 
justice and fairness are upheld at all costs. Yet, in this case, despite glaring 
procedural failures, the legal process has fallen short of delivering the 
remedy that justice demands. Throughout the entire scope of the Texas 
judiciary, there has been no response from the opposing party—no 
depositions, no witness lists, no admitted evidence, and most critically, no 
meaningful hearing. These omissions have not just gone unanswered; 
they’ve left harm unaddressed, with the full consequences still unresolved. 
The pleadings in this case tell the entire story—because, in truth, 
there’s nothing else to go off of. Third-party influences, embedded within the 
clerk’s records before this case even began, have quietly fueled this 
destruction, unnoticed by the system. The lack of response, discovery, or any 
trace of substantive legal engagement raises a troubling question: how did 
we reach the summit of the judiciary with nothing more than general denials 
as our compass?  
What’s remarkable about the law is that before a court can entertain 
such an unbelievable situation, the Relator must meet a heavy burden. This 
case has traveled through the courts without resolution, its impact growing 
heavier with every missed safeguard. That burden is now before this Court, 
and it is here, at the threshold of justice, that the Relator turns to address it.

INTRODUCTION

The law is a remarkable institution, built to evolve, adapt, and ensure that
justice and fairness are upheld at all costs. Yet, in this case, despite glaring
procedural failures, the legal process has fallen short of delivering the
remedy that justice demands. Throughout the entire scope of the Texas
judiciary, there has been no response from the opposing party—no
depositions, no witness lists, no admitted evidence, and most critically, no
meaningful hearing. These omissions have not just gone unanswered;
they’ve left harm unaddressed, with the full consequences still unresolved.

The pleadings in this case tell the entire story—because, in truth,
there’s nothing else to go off of. Third-party influences, embedded within the
clerk’s records before this case even began, have quietly fueled this
destruction, unnoticed by the system. The lack of response, discovery, or any
trace of substantive legal engagement raises a troubling question: how did
we reach the summit of the judiciary with nothing more than general denials
as our compass?

What’s remarkable about the law is that before a court can entertain
such an unbelievable situation, the Relator must meet a heavy burden. This
case has traveled through the courts without resolution, its impact growing
heavier with every missed safeguard. That burden is now before this Court,

and it is here, at the threshold of justice, that the Relator turns to address it.

REASONS TO GRANT  REHEARING 
Relator files this First Amended Motion for Rehearing pursuant to Tex. R. 
App. P. 52.9, and 10.1(a). In support of this motion, Relator shows the following: 
1. The Supreme Court of Texas denied a Petition for Writ of Mandamus in case 24-
0395 on 2024-08-30. Therefore, the Motion for Rehearing is due no later than 2024-
09-16.
2. The Relator filed his Motion for Rehearing on 09-10-2024 and was later amended
on 09-16-2024 to provide clarity to the Court regarding the Sullivan case backdrop. 
3. In support of this first amended motion, the Relator highlights the following
unresolved issues: 
I. Overlooked due process and ethical concerns must be addressed
A. The present case bears some procedural resemblance to Sullivan v.
Lepage-Sullivan, but the differences in how these complaints were addressed 
are both substantial and troubling. In Sullivan, the parties appeared in court 
on April 16, 2013, and through their counsel announced an agreement on 
Yvonne’s motion for temporary orders. The court specifically noted that 
“Yvonne’s counsel would prepare and submit formal temporary orders within 
ten days.” Id., No. 07-15-00081-CV, at 4 (Tex. App. Jan. 25, 2017). Formal

temporary orders were properly entered on May 21, 2013, appointing the 
parties as temporary joint managing conservators. Id. at 4.  
B. In the present case, by contrast, no formal motion for temporary 
orders was ever served. On February 1, 2024, an associate judge’s report 
was drafted by Dan Bacalis1, prior counsel for Relator, after the parties 
appeared in person, but this report was not based on any formally served 
motion for temporary orders. It was further specified that:  
A typed written Order conforming to this Report will 
follow within 20 days from the date this Report is signed. The 
Temporary Order shall be prepared by Dan Bacalis. Each 
attorney should approve the Order. The parties do not need to 
approve the Order. The attorney reviewing the proposed Order 
shall have five (5) days to do so. There are no ten (10) day letters.

C. In Sullivan, Larry Sullivan expressed dissatisfaction with the
temporary orders, discharged his original counsel, and retained new counsel, 
who promptly filed a Motion to Set Aside the Temporary Orders. Larry’s 
complaint was that his original counsel had rushed him into signing the 
associate judge’s report without giving him adequate time to review it.   
D. In the present case, the Relator filed a timely motion to vacate the
associate judge’s report on February 9, 2024, after terminating his legal 
counsel for rushing him into an agreement much like Larry Sullivan.2 
However, this motion was filed prior to the associate judge’s report being 
formalized. A hearing on the motion to vacate was scheduled for March 14, 
2024.
E. On March 4th, 2024, the Relator filed notice with the trial court
explaining that it would not be in the best interests of the children to leave 
the home given the necessity to financially support the children.3 On March 
6th, 2024, while walking his daughters to school during her visitation period, 
the real party in interest ran inside the house and locked the Relator out.

F. At their respective hearings, both Larry and the Relator’s motions 
to vacate were denied. However, unlike in Sullivan, where Larry was given 
time to address his concerns despite being an attorney and despite 
challenging the orders after they had been properly reduced. Id., at 5. In 
contrast, the Relator was ambushed by the opposing counsel just minutes 
before his hearing was to be held. She handed him a 38-page document 
entitled “Temporary Orders”,4 which were the formalized orders based on the 
associate judge’s report signed on February 1st, 2024. Furthermore, in the 
denial of the Relator’s motion to vacate, the associate judge ordered that he 
sign the formally reduced temporary orders by 1:30 P.M. that same day rather 
than providing an explanation for the denial.5 
G. The actions above are reflected in the orders themselves. Without 
hesitation, at the top of page one, the orders read: 
“On February 8 1, 2024, the Court heard Petitioner's motion 
for temporary orders.” Exhibit E 
The absence of such a motion raises the question: How can a hearing be 
referenced in an official court order that was never held, and lacks a served 
motion? Further on page one the order states: 
4  A true, accurate, and certified copy of these orders currently in effect are attached as Exhibit D.     
5  A true, accurate, and certified copy of this denial is attached as Exhibit E.

“The parties have agreed to the terms of this order as 
evidenced by the signatures below” Exhibit D 
H. Relator did not sign these orders. Exhibit D. Moreover, the
opposing counsel was well aware that he did not consent to them. Consent is

judgement "cannot be rendered by a court when consent of one of the parties 
thereto is wanting." Id. at 291. “The power to render an agreed judgment 
depends upon the ‘substance of the consent’ at the time judgment is 
rendered.” Id. at 291. “Therefore, a party has the right to revoke his consent

Samples Exterminators v. Samples, 640 S.W.2d at 875 (Tex. 1982) (per 
curiam.) (“Without consent, the judgment is void”); see also Giles v. Giles, 
830 S.W.2d 232, 235 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1992, no writ). Therefore, the 
temporary orders issued by the Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer must be 
vacated in light of the actions above. 
II. Even if the orders survive due process and consent, they are void
A. The temporary orders issued by Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer
imposed a purported agreed mutual injunction on both parties, restricting 
communication and actions regarding property, and affecting child custody. 
The orders granted temporary joint conservatorship of the children and 
regulated the use of shared property, including the family home, pending 
further court proceedings.  
B. Pursuant to Rule 683 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure:
“[e]very order granting a temporary injunction shall include an order 
setting the cause for trial on the merits with respect to the ultimate relief 
sought”. Tex. R. Civ. P. 683. 
Moreover, Rule 684 states that: 
“[b]efore the issuance of the temporary restraining order or

be approved by the clerk”. Tex. R. Civ. P. 684.

C. This Court has provided the controlling authority over the facial
validity of temporary injunctions and provides a clear resolution to this case. 
In Lancaster v. Lancaster, the injunction was considered void for 
noncompliance with Rule 684 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Id., 155 
Tex. 528, 291 S.W.2d 303, 308 (Tex. 1956). This was later reaffirmed in 
Goodwin v. Goodwin, where an injunction without bond was considered 
“void Ab initio” Id., 456 S.W.2d 885, (Tex. 1970).  
D. In the present situation, the waiver of bond in this case is
ambiguous, as it fails to state the reasons for the waiver, the authority under 
which it was waived, or what justifies its waiver. It simply states, "the bond 
requirement is waived." Moreover, the associate judge’s report from which 
this is based mentions no bond. Further, this fails to comport with the 
statutory language set out in Texas Family Code § 105.001(d), which allows 
the court to dispense with the necessity of a bond in temporary orders on 
behalf of the child. The only statement regarding the children’s welfare in the 
orders is that “The following orders are for the safety and welfare and in the 
best interest of the following children:” which as noted above, is predicated 
from a hearing that never happened, a motion which was never filed nor 
served, and without supporting evidence supporting the claim and from 
where consent was withdrawn.

E. Moreover, the Dallas Court of Appeals invalidated a temporary 
injunction for failing to either set a bond or expressly dispense with the bond 
requirement. The court noted, "[b]ecause the temporary injunction in this 
case neither sets a bond nor states that it is dispensing with the necessity of 
one, we conclude the temporary injunction is void." In re McCray, 05-13-
01195-CV, 2013 WL 5925776, at *3 (Tex. App.—Dallas Nov. 7, 2013, orig. 
proceeding) (mem. op.). Despite the orders in this case waiving a bond, it 
was waived by purported agreement and did not contain the language 
required to dispense the necessity of the bond, subjecting them to being 
declared void and dissolved.  
F. Therefore, by following this reasoning, the temporary orders in the 
present case should similarly be declared void notwithstanding the first issue 
of due process as the bond requirements were not met, and the waiver of 
bond didn’t contain the statutory language needed to properly dispense of it 
under Section 105.001(d) of the Texas Family Code, and it was waived by 
the parties in an agreement from which consent was withdrawn from. As 
stated in In re Garza, 126 S.W.3d 268, 271 (Tex. App. 2003) “…a party who 
agrees to a void order has agreed to nothing.” Id. This is precisely what 
happened here.

III. Preservation of error
A. All but two appellate courts in this State have agreed that error
preservation is not required regarding noncompliance with these rules. The 
Second Court of Appeals is not one of those two. See BSR Surf Resort, LLC 
v. Stabile, No. 10-20-00006-CV, 4 (Tex. App. Nov. 18, 2020). It was 
reaffirmed that standing precedent is that “the majority of the Texas courts of 
appeals, and the Texas supreme court establish that the requirements of Rules 
683 and 684 are mandatory and that a party need not preserve error in the 
trial court when a temporary injunction order does not comply with them.” 
Id.  
B. The Second Court of Appeals falls within the majority. “Only the 
Amarillo and Austin courts of appeals have required preservation of error 
when a temporary injunction order fails to comply with Rules 683 and/or 
684.” Id (referencing Tex. Tech. Univ. Health Sci. Ctr. v. Rao, 105 S.W.3d 
763, 768 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2003, pet. dism'd). 
C. Therefore, since the current orders are based on a motion never 
served to the Relator, where no hearing was held, and fail to comply with the 
mandatory requirements set forth by both Rule 683 and 684 of the Texas 
Rules of Civil Procedure regarding bond due to ambiguous language, they are 
void and must be dissolved.

IV. Diligence met with silence 
A. Without knowing the reasonings behind the denials of relief faced 
thus far, and if such reasonings were for procedural reasons will remain 
unknown. However, the Relator’s diligent pursuit for relief has remained 
rigorous, and as this Court has previously stated in January of this year: 
 
"[e]quity aids the diligent and not those who slumber on their 
rights." In re Walker, 683 S.W.3d 400, 402 (Tex. 2024) (quoting Callahan v. 
Giles, 137 Tex. 571,155 S.W.2d 793, 795 (1941)                                                                
 
The status quo of children has been destroyed by these orders without a 
second thought. This cannot be the way we conduct our institutions of law in 
this great State and Relator hopes this Court will step in and rightfully restore 
the status quo to the children by ordering the Respondent to vacate the current 
order issued by Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer.  
B. The time wasted thus far in addressing these procedural missteps 
and the resulting complications has been significant and regrettable. However, 
the Relator remains fully committed to pursuing a constructive and 
cooperative resolution for the benefit of all parties involved, especially the 
children. The Relator’s need for residency to provide financial support for the 
children cannot be carelessly replaced by a parent who chooses to put herself 
before all else involved in the suit, including the children.

CONCLUSION 
This case is about responsibility. Everyone makes mistakes; it is the 
human condition. However, when those mistakes impact the lives of 
children, the law and conscience compel us to correct them. The best 
interests of the children must always come first. Both parents in this case are 
exemplary, and a better path can be forged for them. 
This case reveals a fundamental truth: when justice wavers, the law 
provides a way to make things right. With the wisdom of this Court, these 
wrongs can be corrected to secure the well-being of the children at the heart 
of this dispute. The temporary orders must be vacated, not simply to honor 
the law but to restore fairness to these children’s lives and preserve their 
status quo and the principles of justice that form the foundation of our 
system. 
The journey has been long, but there’s only one just conclusion before 
the court today: put these orders to rest and enable this Relator who is 
nothing more than a Father to return to the home and business he was 
unjustly discarded from so that an amicable path forward can be forged in the 
best interests of the children. In the pursuit of justice, the Relator holds no ill 
will towards the Respondent, the associate judge, opposing counsel, the real 
party in interest, or third parties. Moving forward, we must all work together 
to ensure the best interests come first as the Texas Family Code mandates.

Petitioner,

Emergency Motion to Reconsider
Evidence and to Vacate Temporary

Orders
Charles Dustin Myers,

Respondent

This motion urgently calls for the Court's intervention to address critical procedural
missteps in the matter of cause# 322-744263-23, aiming to reinstate the safety and stability
that our children rightfully deserve until due process and all facts of the case can be considered
by the Court. I am seeking immediate court intervention to correct procedural errors and
address the misuse of the legal system by the Petitioner. This motion highlights the significant
impact of the Petitioner's actions on our children's welfare and my unjust removal from our

home based on frivolous claims.

In pursuit of justice and the well-being of the children at heart, I respectfully request that
the Court reconsider all details, weighing the comprehensive scenario presented herein along
with the supporting evidence. I am committed to the highest interests of my children and
family, striving to resolve these matters efficiently and avoid unnecessary judicial expenditure.
This document seeks to unveil the Petitioner’s deliberate misrepresentation and misuse of the
legal system, which has gravely disrupted our children's stability and emotional well-being by

weaponizing the court system.

1 On December 1st, 2023, the Petitioner announced her desire for a divorce with no plan in place to preserve our
familial stability, with no desire for counseling or communication, and with no consideration of the timing around
the holiday season, nor any sign of marital discord warranting such a decision leading up to this announcement.

2 Between December 14th, 2023, and December 22nd, 2023, the Petitioner filed for an Emergency Protective
Order, a Divorce Petition, a Protective Order, and instigated an Eviction suit.

NATURE OF SUITS AND THIRD-PARTY INFLUENCE 
1. On December 1st, 2023, Petitioner announced the divorce with no plan in place for the
children, no sign of marital discord leading up to this point to warrant such a decision,
and no desire for counseling, communication, and no consideration for the time of year.
2. Between December 1st, 2023, and December 12th, 2023, all efforts are exhausted in an
attempt to communicate with the Petitioner which lead to the subsequent discovery of an
alarming volume of text messages that were directed towards two individuals – Debbie
Price and Damen Kazlauskas, showing a significant level of influence.³
3. On December 12th, 2023, After the discovery of the communications between these two
individuals combined with the irrational behavior from the Petitioner during such a
critical time of year, I reached out to the Petitioner’s grandfather via text message.⁴
4. On December 13th, 2023, Petitioner states she will be going to talk to her Grandparents
alone. This conversation lasts between 9:55 and 1:30 A.M.
5. On December 14th, 2023, Petitioner filed for an Emergency Protective Order. This order
was denied by the court.
6. On December 15th, 2023, Petitioner involves her family into the situation.
Particularly, Dan Branthoover became involved. He is the boyfriend of the Petitioner’s
Mother. Shortly thereafter, I received a notice from our joint bank account stating that
$1,576 had just been withdrawn. As our bank statement for December 2023 will
demonstrate – the transaction record shows the funds being transferred directly to Mr.
Branthoover’s PayPal account.⁵

FRIVOLOUS CLAIMS AND FALSE STATEMENTS
A. EMERGENCY PROTECTIVE ORDER
1. As mentioned above, Petitioner filed for an Emergency Protective Order on
December 14th, 2023. This protective order was denied by the courts. 
2. Due to the fact this order was not granted by the court, one could conclude that
there was not a clear and present danger of family violence.¹ 
B. THE DIVORCE PETITION
1. Petition was filed on 2024-12-18 under an Affidavit of Inability to pay.²
2. The Petitioner's action of filing for divorce under an Affidavit of Inability to pay
three days after transferring $1,576 to herself starkly contravenes the mandates 
set forth in Chapter 10, Section 10.001 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code. This 
section asserts that each claim or legal contention must be warranted by existing 
law or a nonfrivolous argument for the modification of existing law or the 
establishment of new law, and that each factual contention has or is likely to have 
evidentiary support after further investigation or discovery³. 
3. The Petitioner violated Chapter 10, Section 10.001 a second time within the
same document when she intentionally elected to waive the 60-day waiting 
period claiming to have an active protective order against me that found family 
violence had occurred during our marriage⁴ despite being denied such an order
just five days prior on December 14th, 2023.

General was left unsigned by the Petitioner.

C. EVICTION SUIT
1. The suit was unlawful by nature⁵, as the grounds for eviction were based on
family status, referencing the divorce as well as a protective order that had been 
denied on December 14th, 2023. The suit was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction on 
January 17th, 2024.⁶ 
D. PROTECTIVE ORDER
1. This suit was the second attempt by the Petitioner to have me removed from
the home, which ultimately succeeded. 
2. The claims within this suit mentioned sexually aggressive comments and
threatening behavior. These allegations are materially false, as the Petitioner 
possesses no evidence, and has presented no evidence in relation to these claims 
since the initiation of the suit. Despite this, as video and image evidence will show 
once a fair trial date is set, the Petitioner and I continued to maintain stability at 
our family home and preserved the sense of normalcy that our daughters have 
been accustomed to their entire lives up until January 16th, 2024. 
The Court's decision to remove me from my home and my children’s lives on January 
16th, 2024, albeit preliminary and unjustified, bypassed the safeguarding of the children's 
emotional, psychological, and physical well-being. This oversight is compounded by the 
Petitioner's actions. The juxtaposition of the Court's decision against the backdrop of the 
Petitioner's inattention to the children's needs illuminates a disconcerting disregard for the 
paramount principle that custody determinations should primarily serve the children's best 
interests. The final section of this motion will highlight the procedural aspects of the events 
unfolding between the dates of January 16th, 2024, and February 1st, 2024, and pray the court 
will rectify this situation by restoring the stability to our family by vacating the current 
temporary orders that are in place until a proper investigation can be completed by the courts.

THE PROTECTIVE ORDER HEARINGS 
1. In preparation for the Protective Order hearing on January 16th, 2024, I filed with the
Court an answer to the Protective Order on January 2nd, 2024 as well as two motions – a
motion to consolidate the divorce with the protective order, filed on January 4th, 2024, as
well as a motion of continuance, filed on January 8th, 2024 for the purpose to acquire
counsel due to the complex nature of the case.¹ All three filings were accepted by the
court.
2. On January 16th, 2024, both parties sought additional time to secure legal
representation. Despite not reviewing any evidence, witness testimonies, or documents
related to the motions, and acknowledging the denial of a previous Emergency Protective
Order, the court mandated my departure from our home within four hours. This
decision, unexpectedly made, awarded custody to the Petitioner, overlooking my
concerns about the adverse effects on our children and my work from home. This ruling,
which both parties did not sign, set the case to resume on January 22nd, 2024, to allow
time for obtaining counsel.²
3. Following the court's directive, I relocated to my father's residence in Flower Mound until
the subsequent hearing. During this interval, the Petitioner did not take the initiative to
have the children call once and did not provide any information as to how they were
doing, showcasing her lack of empathy and concern for our children’s well-being and
stability. After incurring substantial expenses to secure representation, I detailed my case
and concerns to my attorney, preparing for the next court appearance.
4. On January 22nd, 2024, the Petitioner chose to seek legal representation just minutes
before the hearing was due to start, indicating a disregard for the process. My lawyer
recommended agreeing to a continuance, thereby extending the period I couldn't work
and impacting our established family dynamics. This resulted in a third hearing being set
for February 1st, coinciding with my birthday, and a second rendition being ordered.³

5. On February 1st, 2024, during the third hearing, the substantive issues I had raised were
not addressed, nor was there any exchange of evidence between our legal representatives. 
Despite the focus of the hearing supposed to be on the protective order, the discussions 
veered into custody and child support matters. My lawyer presented the sole option of a 
temporary return to the family home for 30 days with expanded visitation rights, coupled 
with a child support obligation starting in April. This outcome, which diverged significantly 
from the case's core issues, compelled me to reconsider my legal representation. 
Consequently, I decided to terminate my attorney's services and embarked on drafting this 
motion myself, aiming to bring the court's attention back to the pivotal elements of the case 
that had thus far been neglected while able to legally reside in my home. 
CONCLUSION AND PRAYER 
In conclusion, this motion has laid bare the stark realities and procedural aberrations that have 
marred the essence of justice and due process in the matter of Cause No. 322-744263-23. 
Through the course of these proceedings, it has become abundantly clear that the actions taken 
by the Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, have not only disregarded the welfare and best 
interests of our children but have also illuminated her unfitness as a parent. Her actions speak 
to a pattern of deceit, manipulation, and an unsettling willingness to leverage the judicial 
system for personal vendettas, all at the expense of the emotional and psychological well-being 
of our children. 
The court, in its decisions, inadvertently facilitated this troubling trajectory by removing me, 
Charles Dustin Myers, from the lives of our children based on unsubstantiated claims and 
without due consideration of my role as a devoted and stable parent. This oversight has not 
only disrupted the lives of our children but has also significantly impaired my ability to provide 
for them, casting a long shadow over their future stability and welfare. 
Moreover, the conduct of my Counsel involved has further compounded these issues, 
demonstrating a distressing disregard for the intricate dynamics and facts of this case. This has 
culminated in a situation where the paramount importance of the children's best interests and 
the fundamental principles of fairness and justice have been overshadowed by procedural 
missteps and a lack of thorough investigation into the Petitioner's fitness as a parent.

5. On February 1st, 2024, during the third hearing, the substantive issues I had raised were
not addressed, nor was there any exchange of evidence between our legal representatives.
Despite the focus of the hearing supposed to be on the protective order, the discussions
veered into custody and child support matters. My lawyer presented the sole option of a
temporary return to the family home for 30 days with expanded visitation rights, coupled
with a child support obligation starting in April. This outcome, which diverged significantly
from the case's core issues, compelled me to reconsider my legal representation.
Consequently, I decided to terminate my attorney's services and embarked on drafting this
motion myself, aiming to bring the court's attention back to the pivotal elements of the case
that had thus far been neglected while able to legally reside in my home.

CONCLUSION AND PRAYER

In conclusion, this motion has laid bare the stark realities and procedural aberrations that have
marred the essence of justice and due process in the matter of Cause No. 322-744263-23.
Through the course of these proceedings, it has become abundantly clear that the actions taken
by the Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, have not only disregarded the welfare and best
interests of our children but have also illuminated her unfitness as a parent. Her actions speak
to a pattern of deceit, manipulation, and an unsettling willingness to leverage the judicial
system for personal vendettas, all at the expense of the emotional and psychological well-being
of our children.

The court, in its decisions, inadvertently facilitated this troubling trajectory by removing me,
Charles Dustin Myers, from the lives of our children based on unsubstantiated claims and
without due consideration of my role as a devoted and stable parent. This oversight has not
only disrupted the lives of our children but has also significantly impaired my ability to provide
for them, casting a long shadow over their future stability and welfare.

Moreover, the conduct of my Counsel involved has further compounded these issues,
demonstrating a distressing disregard for the intricate dynamics and facts of this case. This has
culminated in a situation where the paramount importance of the children's best interests and
the fundamental principles of fairness and justice have been overshadowed by procedural
missteps and a lack of thorough investigation into the Petitioner's fitness as a parent.

Therefore, it is with a heavy hearted yet unwavering resolve that I implore the Court to take 
immediate and decisive action to rectify these wrongs. Specifically, I respectfully request the 
Court to: 
1. Vacate the existing temporary orders that unjustly removed me from my home and
separated me from my children, restoring the status quo ante until a thorough and
unbiased evaluation of the facts can be conducted, as the Texas Constitution requires. If
left as it stands, these orders will further compound the issues at hand, and will
exacerbate the chaos introduced into the children’s lives.
2. Set a fair hearing date to delve into the substantive issues at hand, ensuring that all
parties are given an equitable opportunity to present their case and that the best
interests of our children are placed at the forefront of all considerations.
3. Scrutinize any response or new claims from the Petitioner or her counsel with the utmost
diligence, given the established pattern of deceitful and manipulative behavior exhibited
by the Petitioner throughout these proceedings.
4. Consider awarding me full custody of our children, ensuring their continued access to a
stable, nurturing environment, and the consistent provision of their needs, which I am
fully committed to upholding. Furthermore, in alignment with my enduring belief in the
importance of both parents in the lives of our children, I pledge to facilitate and
encourage a healthy, constructive relationship between the children and their mother,
provided she demonstrates a genuine commitment to their well-being and stability.
5. In seeking these remedies, I do so not out of vindictiveness but from a place of deep
concern for the welfare of our children and a steadfast belief in the principles of justice
and fairness. Despite the pain and turmoil of these proceedings, my ultimate desire is for
peace and the best possible outcome for all parties involved, most importantly, our
children. It is my sincere hope that the Court will recognize the gravity of the situation
and act in a manner that prioritizes the well-being of our children, ensuring their return
to a life marked by stability and love.
I affirm under penalty of perjury that all claims herein are true and accurate to the best of my 
knowledge. 
Respectfully submitted on this 9th day of February 2024,

Dear Clerk of the Court, 
This letter is submitted on behalf of the Respondent in the above-referenced case to 
provide the court with an update on the Respondent's efforts to uphold the well-being of 
the children under the current agreed arrangements pending review and to navigate the 
complexities of this case. The following reasons why it is impossible for the Respondent 
to vacate the family home under the current agreement pending review are as follows: 
1. Since the inception of the case, the Respondent's primary focus has been to reset 
the status quo ante for the benefit of the children, ensuring their lives remain as 
normal and uninterrupted as possible during this transitory period after it was 
significantly disrupted beginning on January 16th, 2024. Despite the challenges 
posed by the non-suited protective order and the dropped allegations of family 
violence which were the foundations of all decisions made within this case, the 
Respondent has respected the orders pending review, and has strived to provide a 
stable and supportive environment for his children during his designated time, all 
while planning a transition that best suits his children. 
 
2. During the short amount of time the Respondent has been re-instated to his home, 
the Petitioner has, on multiple occasions, entered the residence unannounced and 
without prior consent, actions which stand in stark contrast to her prior requests 
for protection which have governed this case.

care expense, the incurring conservator must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
nonincurring conservator personally received receipts, bills, statements, or explanations of
benefits reflecting the unreimbursed portion of the health-care expense no later than thirty days
after the incurring conservator received them. Even if the incurring conservator fails to meet that
burden of proof, the Court may award the incurring conservator a judgment in the nature of child
support against the nonincurring conservator in the amount of the unreimbursed portion of the
heath-care expense the nonincurring conservator was ordered but fail to pay.

6. WARNING - A PARENT ORDERED TO PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE
OR DENTAL INSURANCE OR TO PAY THE OTHER PARENT ADDITIONAL CHILD
SUPPORT FOR THE COST OF HEALTH INSURANCE OR DENTAL INSURANCE WHO
FAILS TO DO SO IS LIABLE FOR NECESSARY MEDICAL EXPENSES OF THE
CHILDREN, WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER THE EXPENSES WOULD HAVE BEEN
PAID IF HEALTH INSURANCE OR DENTAL INSURANCE HAD BEEN PROVIDED, AND
FOR THE COST OF HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS, DENTAL INSURANCE
PREMIUMS, OR CONTRIBUTIONS, IF ANY, PAID ON BEHALF OF THE CHILDREN.

7. Notice to Employer - On this date a Medical Support Notice was signed by the
Court. For the purpose of section 1169 of title 29 of the United States Code, the conservator not
carrying the health or dental insurance policy is designated the custodial parent and alternate

recipient's representative.
