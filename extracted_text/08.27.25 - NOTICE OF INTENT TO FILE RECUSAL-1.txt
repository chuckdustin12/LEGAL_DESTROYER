TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THIS COURT:

Respondent, Charles Dustin Myers, respectfully submits this notice
regarding the intent to file a tertiary recusal. The Respondent hereby puts the
reviewing staff members, the opposing party, the Honorable Judge of this Court,
and the Regional Presiding Judge on notice to bring attention to the critical and
compounding issues that continue to accrue within this matter.

The court and all officials involved are statutorily and ethically obligated to
ensure that the motion, when filed, is handled in strict compliance with the law and
with the highest standards of fairness and integrity. The judge must continue to
preside over the case unless and until the motion is sustained, but must also ensure
that the process is transparent, impartial, and free from any appearance of
impropriety. See Tex. Gov't. Code § 25.00256).

I. Summary 
 
1. Respondent has exhausted all available procedural and substantive 
remedies to have his concerns addressed, and the 322nd District Court is legally 
and ethically obligated to resolve these outstanding issues—especially those 
involving recusal, due process, and the integrity of prior orders—before 
proceeding to a final trial. To do otherwise would violate Texas constitutional, 
statutory, and ethical mandates requiring fairness, impartiality, and public 
confidence in the judiciary. 
 
2. The Texas judiciary is governed by a comprehensive framework of 
constitutional provisions, statutes, and judicial conduct codes that collectively 
impose strict obligations on courts and judges to act fairly, honestly, and with 
integrity. These obligations are especially pronounced in matters involving recusal, 
where the appearance and reality of impartiality are essential to maintaining public 
trust in the judicial system. 
 
3. When a party files a recusal motion—including a tertiary recusal—Texas 
law prescribes specific procedures to ensure that the motion is handled impartially 
and efficiently, and that the judge’s conduct does not undermine the integrity of the 
process. Judges must avoid actual bias and even the appearance of impropriety and

involving recusal, due process, and the integrity of prior orders—before
proceeding to a final trial. To do otherwise would violate Texas constitutional,

impose strict obligations on courts and judges to act fairly, honestly, and with
integrity. These obligations are especially pronounced in matters involving recusal,
where the appearance and reality of impartiality are essential to maintaining public

trust in the judicial system.

3. When a party files a recusal motion—including a tertiary recusal—Texas
law prescribes specific procedures to ensure that the motion is handled impartially
and efficiently, and that the judge’s conduct does not undermine the integrity of the

process. Judges must avoid actual bias and even the appearance of impropriety and

must comply with both the letter and spirit of the law to uphold the legitimacy of 
the courts. 
II. Background and Relevant Law 
A. Constitutional and Statutory Framework 
 
3. Texas law imposes strict constitutional, statutory, and ethical duties on 
courts and judges to ensure that all proceedings, especially those involving recusal 
and allegations of bias, are handled with the utmost fairness, integrity, and 
transparency. Respondent has repeatedly invoked these protections, filing verified 
motions, objections, and requests for hearings, and has documented procedural 
irregularities, unaddressed motions, and violations of due process and the Texas 
Family Code; the court’s failure to address these matters before moving to final 
trial would undermine the legitimacy of the judicial process and erode public trust. 
 
4. Texas courts are vested with inherent powers to control proceedings, 
ensure justice is done, and require that all proceedings are conducted with dignity 
and order. See Tex. Gov't. Code § 21.001. Judges are statutorily required to 
diligently discharge their administrative responsibilities, rule on cases within 
specified timeframes, and, crucially, follow established procedures for recusal and 
disqualification to address any potential bias or conflict of interest. See Tex. Gov't. 
Code § 74.059.

5. The 322nd District Court must resolve all pending recusal motions, 
procedural objections, and due process concerns before setting the case for final 
trial, as required by the Texas Constitution, Government Code, Family Code, and 
binding Texas Supreme Court precedent. Proceeding to trial without first 
addressing these threshold issues would not only contravene established law but 
also risk disciplinary consequences for the court and continuous irreparable harm 
to the children, especially where the record reflects a pattern of unaddressed bias, 
procedural irregularities, and violations of fundamental rights. 
B. Recusal and Disqualification Procedures 
 
6. Texas law provides a detailed framework for recusal and disqualification. 
When a motion for recusal is filed, the judge must either recuse themselves or refer 
the motion to the presiding judge for assignment to another judge (Tex. Gov't. 
Code § 29.055). For tertiary recusal motions (the third or subsequent recusal 
motion by the same party), the judge must continue to preside over the case and 
move it toward final disposition unless and until the motion is sustained (Tex. 
Gov't. Code § 25.00256). However, the judge must still comply with all applicable 
procedural rules for recusal and disqualification, and the process must be handled 
in a manner that is transparent, impartial, and consistent with due process (Tex. 
Gov't. Code § 25.00255).

7. The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, specifically Rule 18a, require that a 
motion to recuse be verified, state with particularity the grounds for recusal, and be 
served on all parties. Once a sufficient motion is filed, the judge must either recuse 
themselves or request the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district to 
assign another judge to hear the motion. If a recusal motion is timely and facially 
sufficient, a hearing is mandatory. 
C. Due Process and Family Law Protections 
 
8. Due process under the United States and Texas Constitutions requires that 
no person be deprived of life, liberty, or property without notice and an opportunity 
to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. See In re V.K., 607 
S.W.3d 471 (Tex. App. 2020)). In family law, the natural right between parents and 
children is of constitutional dimension, and courts must strictly adhere to statutory 
requirements before issuing orders that affect these rights (Tex. Fam. Code § 
83.006). 
D. Judicial Conduct and Ethical Standards 
 
9. Judges are required to act at all times in a manner that promotes public 
confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. They must avoid both 
actual bias and the appearance of bias, and recuse themselves when their

10. In the present case, these requirements have fallen short in every aspect,

the issues.

E. Respondent’s Exhaustion of Remedies 
 
11. The record demonstrates that Charles Myers has taken every reasonable 
and available step to have his concerns addressed by the 322nd District Court. He 
has: 
 
i.  
Filed verified motions to recuse, stating with particularity the  
 
 
grounds for recusal as required by Rule 18a; 
 
ii.  
Objected to procedural irregularities, including the improper  
 
 
involvement of the court coordinator in recusal matters, which  
 
 
is not  authorized by the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure;

Sought hearings on his motions, as mandated by law;

These actions satisfy, and indeed exceed, the procedural and substantive 
requirements imposed by Texas law for a party seeking judicial relief and 
accountability. 
F. The Court’s Legal and Ethical Obligations 
 
12. The 322nd District Court is bound by constitutional, statutory, and 
ethical mandates to address all pending recusal motions, procedural objections, and 
due process concerns before proceeding to a final trial. The Texas Constitution and 
Government Code require judges to act with integrity, avoid bias, and ensure that 
all proceedings are conducted fairly and in accordance with the law (Tex. Const. 
art. 5 § 1-a; Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.059). 
 
13. When a recusal motion is filed, the judge must either recuse themselves 
or refer the motion to the presiding judge for assignment to another judge (Tex. 
Gov't. Code § 29.055). The judge may not take further action in the case until the 
recusal motion is resolved, except for good cause stated in the order. For tertiary 
recusal motions, the judge must continue to preside over the case, but this does not 
relieve the court of its duty to ensure that the recusal process is handled impartially 
and in strict compliance with procedural rules (Tex. Gov't. Code § 25.00256).

due process concerns before proceeding to a final trial. The Texas Constitution and
Government Code require judges to act with integrity, avoid bias, and ensure that
all proceedings are conducted fairly and in accordance with the law (Tex. Const.

art. 5 § l-a; Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.059).

13. When a recusal motion is filed, the judge must either recuse themselves
or refer the motion to the presiding judge for assignment to another judge (Tex.

reversal of judicial decisions (Tex. Const. art. 5 § 1-a; Sun Exploration and 
Production Co. v. Jackson, 783 S.W.2d 202 (Tex. 1989)). 
 
15. Therefore, if this Court chooses to not act sua sponte within a reasonable 
time, when the recusal motion follows – the involvement of the court coordinator 
should be prohibited, as her involvement in the prior two recusal proceedings lead 
to questionable actions, delay, and created conflicts of interest. The recusal 
procedure is designed to ensure public confidence in the judiciary, and her 
continued involvement has proven to have the opposite effect. 
G. The Importance of Addressing Threshold Issues Before Final Trial 
 
16. Proceeding to a final trial without first addressing the lack of 
participation by the opposing side, the current ‘agreed orders’ that bear one side’s 
signature, due process violations, and procedural objections would violate the 
fundamental principles of fairness and impartiality that underpin the Texas judicial 
system. The Texas Supreme Court has made clear that even the appearance of 
impropriety or bias is sufficient to require recusal, as public confidence in the 
judiciary is paramount. See Sun Exploration and Production Co. v. Jackson, 783 
S.W.2d 202 (Tex. 1989); See also Sears v. Nueces County Sherriff Olivarez, 28 
S.W.3d 611 (Tex. App. 2000)).

17. Moreover, Texas law provides that an interlocutory appeal from certain 
orders, such as those granting or refusing a temporary injunction, stays the 
commencement of a trial in the trial court pending resolution of the appeal (Tex. 
Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 51.014). This underscores the principle that threshold 
issues must be resolved before a case can proceed to final disposition. 
H. The Consequences of Judicial Inaction 
 
18. The record reflects a pattern of judicial inaction, procedural 
irregularities, and potential bias that, if left unaddressed, would not only harm the 
parties but also erode public confidence in the judiciary. The Texas Supreme Court 
has held that judicial decisions rendered under circumstances that suggest bias, 
prejudice, or favoritism undermine the integrity of the courts and thwart the 
principles on which the judicial system is based. See Sun Exploration and 
Production Co. v. Jackson, 783 S.W.2d 202 (Tex. 1989)). 
 
19. In this case, the court’s failure to address dispositive motions, recusal 
proceedings in accordance with the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and due 
process violations—despite repeated and documented efforts by the Respondent—
raises serious questions about the impartiality and integrity of the proceedings. The 
court’s obligation is not merely to move cases to final trial, but to ensure that 
justice is done in an orderly, fair, and transparent manner (Tex. Gov't. Code §

H. The Consequences of Judicial Inaction

18. The record reflects a pattern of judicial inaction, procedural

parties but also erode public confidence in the judiciary. The Texas Supreme Court
has held that judicial decisions rendered under circumstances that suggest bias,
prejudice, or favoritism undermine the integrity of the courts and thwart the
principles on which the judicial system is based. See Sun Exploration and

21.001). Here, this Court has permitted a non-prosecuting attorney to exist merely 
to block relief, not participate in the issues, and not comply with discovery 
requests, while allowing her client, Morgan Michelle Myers, to escape 
accountability for the deceptive pleadings and harm caused to the children. 
IV. Conclusion 
 
20. The Respondent, Charles Myers has done everything the law requires—
and more—to have his concerns addressed by the 322nd District Court. The court 
is legally and ethically obligated to resolve all outstanding dispositive motions, 
procedural objections, and due process concerns before proceeding to a final trial. 
To do otherwise would violate the Texas Constitution, Government Code, Family 
Code, and binding Texas Supreme Court precedent, and would undermine the 
integrity of the judicial process and public confidence in the judiciary. The court 
must act now to restore fairness, impartiality, and justice to these proceedings. 
 
21. Shall the court not provide an explanation for the conduct alleged herein, 
or at least sua sponte set a hearing on these issues, Respondent will initiate recusal 
proceedings, will pursue further Mandamus relief, and will pursue Federal 
Injunctive Relief for all involved parties in their individual capacities who have
