SUMMARY 
1. This case was procured through fraudulent means, intended to deprive 
Respondent of custody of his children and his marital home at 6641 Anne Court, 
Watauga, Texas 76148. On January 16, 2024, Respondent was removed from the 
residence based on court orders influenced by the false representations made in this 
matter. Furthermore, on March 6, 2024, Petitioner unlawfully locked Respondent out 
of the home, exacerbating the harm caused by these proceedings. 
2. Prior to filing the divorce proceedings, Petitioner utilized Defendant 
Branthoover’s PayPal account to transfer marital funds into a concealed bank 
account, depriving Respondent of access to financial resources. Immediately 
following this transfer, Petitioner submitted an Affidavit of Inability to Pay Court 
Costs (IFP Statement) to this Court. 
3. Petitioner’s Original Petition for Divorce misrepresented the facts by alleging 
the existence of an active protective order against Respondent and claiming findings 
of family violence during the marriage, both of which were demonstrably false. 
Additionally, Petitioner’s Application for a Protective Order relied on baseless 
claims of family violence that caused significant damage to Respondent’s livelihood 
and the financial stability of the children. No supporting evidence was provided to 
substantiate these allegations. 
4. At the time of these filings, Petitioner was self-represented and enlisted the 
assistance of Defendant Branthoover, who is not an attorney but has extensive

2. Prior to filing the divorce proceedings, Petitioner utilized Defendant
Branthoover’s PayPal account to transfer marital funds into a concealed bank

following this transfer, Petitioner submitted an Affidavit of Inability to Pay Court
Costs (IFP Statement) to this Court.

3. Petitioner’s Original Petition for Divorce misrepresented the facts by alleging

knowledge of protective orders and a documented history of falsifying government 
records. Branthoover’s involvement included drafting and preparing legal 
documents designed to mislead the Court, furthering the fraudulent scheme. 
5. These actions have been detailed in the related federal lawsuit as well as within 
this matter, where the claims remain uncontested. The issues presented in the federal 
case bear directly on the integrity of the proceedings before this Court. 
CONCLUSION 
Considering the above, Respondent respectfully requests this Court to take 
judicial notice of the related federal case and should use its discretion to dismiss this 
matter without prejudice to avoid the continued waste of judicial resources.  
Respondent believes further that Petitioner has no ability to prosecute the case. 
Respondent reserves the right to seek additional relief as necessary to preserve his 
legal rights and protect the best interests of his children. 
 
Respectfully submitted on this 31st day of December 2024. Wishing the Court a 
prosperous and Happy New Year,
