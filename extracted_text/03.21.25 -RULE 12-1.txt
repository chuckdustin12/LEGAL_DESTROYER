IN THE 233RD DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
 
 
 
TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THE 233RD DISTRICT COURT: 
COMES NOW, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, Petitioner pro se, and files this Rule 12 
Motion to Show Authority pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12, and respectfully shows 
the Court as follows: 
1. There is a general presumption that an attorney is acting with authority; however, that 
presumption is rebuttable. Breceda v. Whi, 187 S.W.3d 148, 152 (Tex. App.--El Paso 2006, no 
pet.). If evidence or circumstances cast doubt on the attorney’s authority, the presumption gives 
way and the attorney must prove actual authority. For example, an attorney who conducted a trial 
is presumed authorized to pursue an appeal, but that presumption can be rebutted with contrary 
evidence. Here, the unusual facts surrounding Ms. Carter’s involvement thoroughly rebut any 
presumption of her authority to represent the Respondent named in this matter, Morgan Michelle 
Myers, as detailed below.

TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THE 2338” DISTRICT COURT:

COMES NOW, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, Petitioner pro se, and files this Rule 12
Motion to Show Authority pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12, and respectfully shows

the Court as follows:

1. There is a general presumption that an attorney is acting with authority; however, that

I. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12 – Attorney Must Show Authority 
A. Carter’s Lack of Authority Indicia 
 
2. A party in a suit or proceeding pending in a court of this state may, by sworn written 
motion stating that he believes the suit or proceeding is being prosecuted or defended without 
authority, cause the attorney to be cited to appear before the court and show his authority to act. 
The notice of the motion shall be served upon the challenged attorney at least ten days before the 
hearing on the motion. At the hearing on the motion, the burden of proof shall be upon the 
challenged attorney to show sufficient authority to prosecute or defend the suit on behalf of the 
other party. Tex. R. Civ. P. 
3. Multiple red flags call into question whether Carter is authorized – or even genuinely 
acting – as Ms. Myers’s counsel, justifying relief under Rule 12. Petitioner respectfully requests 
that the court requires RODERICK D. MARX and COOPER L. CARTER to appear and show 
their authority to represent MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS in this matter to clear up the 
ambiguity surrounding their representation. 
B. Pleadings Filed by Proxy 
4. Every filing attributed to Carter in this case was filed through another attorney, Roderick 
Marx, rather than by Carter herself. Mr. Marx is the founding partner of the MAJ firm Carter 
formerly worked for, and he submitted documents “on her behalf” through the electronic filing 
manager. In effect, Carter has not personally prosecuted or defended anything – someone else is 
handling the filings. This raises serious doubts about whether Carter is acting as counsel or whether 
Mrs. Myers’s case is being carried (or neglected) by others without a clear designation. An attorney 
of record should be the one signing filings or at least directly supervising and endorsing them; if

not, the court and opposing party cannot even be sure the attorney whose name is on the pleadings 
is truly involved. Such proxy filings strongly indicate that Carter may lack authority or engagement 
– if she had authority, one would expect her direct participation. Rule 12 is meant to prevent exactly 
this sort of scenario where a suit might be conducted by someone without clear authorization. 
C. Employment/Firm Misrepresentation 
5. Carter’s own public statements conflict with the representations made to the court about 
her role. While her pleadings continued to identify her as “Cooper Carter, Marx Altman & 
Johnson” (with a MAJ email address), her initial response in the instant case was filed by Roderick 
D Marx, signed by Cooper Carter with the Marx, Altman & Johnson letterhead, and then claimed 
that Cooper L. Carter was retained in her individual capacity. Further: 
i. Carter’s public Facebook profile claims that she is no longer employed with Marx, 
Altman, & Johnson.  
ii. Carter’s public LinkedIn profile claims that she is no longer employed with Marx, 
Altman, & Johnson, and that she currently is employed at Cantey and Hanger, LLP. 
iii. Carter’s Electronic Filing Manager is registered under ccarter@canteyhangar.com. 
This level of ambiguity is unnecessary and could be deliberate. In fact, Texas law requires attorneys 
to keep their State Bar profile updated with current employment information (Tex. Gov’t Code 
§ 81.115), which currently reflects her employment with Marx, Altman & Johnson.  So the 
question remains: why would Carter update her Texas State Bar profile to reflect her current 
employer but leave her social media and LinkedIn outdated?

D. Failure to Participate or Respond (Abandonment)

6. Carter’s complete failure to prosecute the divorce case for an extended period also 
undercuts any claim of active authority. An attorney who is truly acting with a client’s authorization 
is expected to pursue the client’s interests diligently – e.g. respond to motions, appear at hearings, 
move the case forward. Carter, however, has been conspicuously silent. She has not plead any 
defense for her client, has not participated in any discovery.  
7. Carter’s abrupt appearance in this suit—after months of silence in the divorce case—
mirrors the same confusion and procedural uncertainty that plagued the divorce action. This re-
emergence appears tactical, not substantive, and should not obstruct the SAPCR’s merits-based 
progression. She has not mentioned anything about the children, their status, or how the current 
situation is what’s best for them.  
8. Carter’s only notable action in the last six months related to her client has been to seek 
consolidation of the SAPCR with the dormant divorce – essentially tethering the active custody 
matter to a paralyzed divorce case which would further prejudice the children and delay the relief 
sought. 
II. Conflicts of Interest and Duty of Candor 
9. Misrepresenting one’s role or affiliation can also create conflicts of interest and 
breaches of the duty of candor. If an attorney signs pleadings stating it was “necessary to retain 
their legal services” while filing under a firm’s name, it muddles who was retained – the individual 
lawyer or the firm. This ambiguity can prejudice the client’s interests and the opposing party’s 
understanding of the representation. 
10. For example, in the case at hand the answer explicitly stated, “It was necessary for 
Morgan [Michelle] Myers to secure the services of COOPER L. CARTER, a licensed attorney, to

prepare and defend this suit.”.  Yet, the filing was styled as coming from “Marx Altman & 
Johnson” with Carter as the attorney. If Mrs. Carter was operating as a solo practitioner at that 
point, the pleading arguably misled the court about who had been hired. This kind of 
misrepresentation may violate the lawyer’s candor toward the tribunal (e.g. Tex. Disc. R. 3.03 
or its equivalents) since it obscures a material fact – the lawyer’s true status. Courts have held that 
lawyers must not omit facts necessary to keep statements from being misleading. Failing to clarify 
that the attorney is no longer with the named firm, it could be seen as an omission that makes the 
filing as a whole misleading. 
III. Unauthorized Filings and “Ghost” Representation 
12. Having documents filed by another attorney who has not formally appeared is another 
problematic practice. In proper procedure, every pleading or motion must be signed by an 
attorney of record – i.e. a lawyer who has made an appearance in the case. Texas is clear: “Every 
pleading of a party represented by an attorney shall be signed by at least one attorney of record 
in his individual name.” If Attorney A is counsel of record, it is improper for Attorney B (who 
has not appeared in the case) to file documents on A’s behalf without disclosure or court 
permission.  
13. In the example above, the e-filing system’s certificate shows “Roderick Marx on 
behalf of Cooper Carter” as the filer, neither of which have formally appeared. This kind of 
“ghost filing” blurs who is responsible for the document. Courts frown upon undisclosed 
involvement of attorneys because it can circumvent accountability and confuse the record. At 
best, it is an irregular practice; at worst, it could be seen as misrepresentation to the court. Here, 
given the same circumstances exist in the divorce case which has been abandoned, Petitioner 
believes the situation leans more towards misrepresentation.

14. Procedurally, if an attorney who is not counsel of record submits a filing, the court 
may treat that filing as nullity or require it to be redone. No appearance means no authority to 
act. From an ethical standpoint, using another lawyer to file pleadings without notice may 
implicate rules against aiding in rule violations. Lawyers are forbidden from assisting or 
inducing others to violate the rules (see Tex. Disc. R. 8.04(a)(1). If Attorney A knows they 
should appear officially but instead has Attorney B file a document to evade a procedural 
requirement, both attorneys tread on thin ice. They could be seen as trying to circumvent the 
rules of the tribunal. At a minimum, this lack of transparency undermines trust. The proper 
course would have been for the second attorney to file a notice of appearance (if joining the case) 
or for the original attorney to personally sign and file the pleading. Having someone “cover” a 
filing without formal acknowledgment is not a recognized practice. In short, any attorney 
involved in a case needs to either be of record or stay behind the scenes entirely. But if an 
attorney actually files or signs on behalf of the attorney of record, that person effectively steps 
into the role of counsel without the court’s knowledge, which is improper. It is better to err on 
the side of disclosure – either by formal association of that attorney or by avoiding involvement 
in filing. 
15. As pointed out, the Petitioner believes that this is occurring because Carter’s EFM 
account is setup under her prior employer’s email address. So why not change it to reflect the 
correct address and file your own pleadings? Lastly, these same issues have been present in the 
divorce matter, and although Carter was served with a Rule 12 motion in that case on September 
20, 2024, she has yet to clear up this issue.  
IV. CONCLUSION AND PRAYER

MARX, raising questions regarding actual representation authority and participation. c. 
Inconsistencies in public statements and professional profiles by COOPER L. CARTER 
concerning her current employment and representation status. d. The complete absence of 
meaningful participation or prosecution of related divorce proceedings for a prolonged 
period, contrasted by her sudden appearance and procedural interference in this Suit

5. These facts collectively cast substantial and justifiable doubt upon the claimed 
representation of MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS by COOPER L. CARTER and 
RODERICK D. MARX, necessitating judicial inquiry.

representation, procedural integrity, and, most importantly, to safeguard the best interests 
and welfare of the children involved in this case. 
7. I believe wholeheartedly that Cooper L. Carter is litigating in bad faith, has no genuine

REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION

There is a general presumption that an attorney is acting with authority;
however, that presumption is rebuttable. Breceda v. Whi, 187 S.W.3d 148, 152
(Tex. App.--El Paso 2006, no pet.); Kelly v. Murphy, 630 S.W.2d 759, 761

I. Legal Basis for Rule 12 Motion
2. Pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. § 12, a party may challenge an attorney’s
authority to act on behalf of a party in a proceeding. When such a challenge is 
raised, the burden of proof shifts to the challenged attorney to demonstrate 
their authority to represent the party. Id. The attorney must appear before the 
trial court and show sufficient authority to prosecute or defend the suit on 
behalf of their client. (Breceda v. Whi (2006) 187 S.W.3d 148, 152; Kelly v. 
Murphy (1982) 630 S.W.2d 759, 761). 
3. Rule 12 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure permits any party to 
challenge an attorney’s authority to prosecute or defend a lawsuit. (See Nolana 
Open MRI Ctr., Inc. v. Pechero (2015) No. 13-13-00552-CV, at *15). The 
purpose of a Rule 12 motion is to protect parties from groundless suits and to 
permit dismissal of suits instituted without authority. (See Nicholas v. Envtl. 
Sys. (Int’l) Ltd. (2016) 499 S.W.3d 888, 895; Angelina Cty. v. McFarland 
(1964) 374 S.W.2d 417, 422–23). 
4. Here, the procedural inconsistencies, lack of formal notice, and 
submission of documents by other parties on behalf of Ms. Carter raise 
substantial doubts about whether she possesses the necessary authority to 
represent the Petitioner. Despite being allegedly retained on January 22, 2024, 
Ms. Carter has not filed a formal notice of appearance, leaving her role 
ambiguous. Further complicating matters, filings under her name have been 
submitted by others, including the founder of Marx Altman & Johnson, her 
purported former employer. Coupled with her suspiciously timed State Bar 
profile update and lack of meaningful engagement, these facts compel the 
Respondent to seek clarification and challenge her authority under Rule 12.

II. Procedural Basis
5. No Formal Notice of Appearance Filed. Although Cooper Carter
was allegedly retained on January 22, 2024, she has not filed a formal Notice 
of Appearance in this case. The absence of a Notice of Appearance creates 
substantial ambiguity regarding her authority to represent the Petitioner, 
especially given the procedural irregularities discussed below.  
6. Lack of engagement. Throughout the proceedings, Ms. Carter
has consistently failed to engage in any meaningful way and has failed 
to respond to any pleadings in the suit. 
7. Filings Submitted on Behalf of Cooper Carter. All court
documents and pleadings attributed to Ms. Carter have been submitted "on her 
behalf" by Roderick Marx, the founder of Marx Altman & Johnson. There 
is no indication that Ms. Carter is directly involved in this matter, raising 
significant questions about whether she is properly authorized to act as 
counsel for Morgan Michelle Myers.  
8. Discrepancies in employment. On Ms. Carter’s public social
media, she claims to be a former attorney for Marx Altman & Johnson and 
claims to be employed currently with Cantey Hanger LLP.1 The timeliness of 
her profile aligns with the public article released by Cantey Hanger LLP

current and up-to-date profile. Tex. Gov’t Code § 81.115. Notably, Ms. 
Carter’s profile was updated on March 13th, 2024, one day prior to the only 
hearing that has occurred in this matter3 to her former employer. The 
Respondent has actively been seeking relief from the result of the 
aforementioned hearing for nearly seven months without any engagement or 
any authoritative activity from Ms. Carter, thus warranting this motion. 
III. Prayer and Relief
9. Given the ongoing procedural irregularities and the apparent lack of
clarity surrounding Cooper Carter’s authority to represent Petitioner Morgan 
Myers, the Respondent respectfully requests the following: 
i.
The Court should schedule a hearing requiring Cooper Carter to
personally appear and definitively prove her authority to represent
Morgan Myers, and to provide clarification as to who is involved in
the case, and in what capacity Morgan Michelle Myers is being
represented  in this matter.
ii.
"Upon [her] failure to show such authority, the court shall refuse
to permit the attorney to appear in the cause, and shall strike the
pleadings if no person who is authorized to prosecute or defend
appears." (Tex. R. Civ. P. 12; see Kindle v. Wood Cnty. Elec. Co-op, Inc.
