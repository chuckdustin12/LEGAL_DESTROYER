Dan, I'm going to need you to put the money back that i need
to pay our bills and clear my account deficit.

| move money around all the time, which is evident in the
transaction records and has always been in the best interest
of all of us.

This most recent move was malicious and manipulative, and
has negatively impacted our financial situation.

You should be trying to help resolve this - not further
complicate it.

| can't order any presents this weekend for the girls.

| can't work due to mental anguish - also not good for the
girls.

All I've done is try to explain that we should work on this -
especially when you look at the
facts versus the narrative.

Morgan needs insurance on the car. My own insurance is
now late. Water bill is late- which threatens our auto-pay
setup.

Despite not understanding any of this and none of it making
sense - | still have to do what's in the best interest for
Morgan and the girls, as | always have so long as | was
aware of what | needed to be working on.

There's still time to turn this around - hash it out, and realize
that this family and those two girls and everything we've
done are worth fighting for.

'Il keep trying until | can't.

We can still save Christmas.

O! <

I'm not someone who takes lightly to
threats or attempted intimidation.

Take care Charlie. | hope you make
some good choices in the next few
weeks. So far you're not showing
you're capable. 4:18 PA

She transferred money to her own
account that you said was hers. End of
discussion. Have a good evening.

By the way, the money IS hers.
