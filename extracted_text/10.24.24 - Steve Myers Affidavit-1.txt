presented Charles Myers with a Temporary Orders document.

Prior to the proceeding, Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer mentioned ”! had to stay here until 6 last
night to read all your filings. | know about the summary judgement”.

During the proceeding, Charles Myers attempted to raise the issue of family violence
allegations being the foundation of the case and was objected for relevance and
sustained by Judge Kaitcer.

Cooper Carter called Morgan Myers to testify. Norgan testified she did not feel safe
around Charles Myers. On cross examination, Charles Myers asked Morgan if she
waived the 60 day waiting period due to an active protective order. Charles Myers was
objected for relevance and Judge Kaitcer sustained. Charles Myers then brought up
section 6.405(b) of the family code which was also waived as irrelevant.

During the proceeding, Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer made a comment speaking to Charles
Myers "you don't care about your kids. All you care about is your business"
