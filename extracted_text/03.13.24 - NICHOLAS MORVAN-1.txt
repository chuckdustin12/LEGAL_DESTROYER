Affidavit

THE STATE OF _Gatifornia

COUNTY OF Orange

The person who signed this affidavit, appeared in person, before me, the

undersigned notary, and stated under oath:

My name is Nicholas Glen Morvan ;

| am of sound mind and capable of making this statement. | have personal knowledge of
the facts written in this statement. | understand that if | lie in this statement, | may be held
criminally responsible. This statement is true and correct.

| am a paying customer of Charles Myers for the past two years and four months. In this time, he has been
working exclusively out of his home office to run his business, and provide for his family.

Charles has worked very hard for the past two years to provide a quality experience that benefits

all of his customers. His ability to provide these services have been directly impacted by his inability to

access his home office. As a result, my experience as a customer has suffered, and | am not receiving

the level of service that | have been paying for. | understand that there are unfortunate circumstances

and | am patient while Charles resolves his situation. He has been incredibly apologetic that he cannot

provide the same level of quality, and uninterrupted service due to his inability to work out of his home

office. | do not question his integrity with regards to this situation, he has always been honest and upfront

with myself and others. My hope is that he may return to his home office in order to avoid shutting down
