Cooper and Morgan,
Today, the Judge of the 233rd District Court prohibited exhibits from being filed with the court.
This is clearly an attempt to thwart the Mandamus proceedings given the exhibits I was trying to include are crucial to the
issues presented.
Therefore,
Pursuant to Tex. R. App. P. 52.7(c), I am providing you a copy of the SUPPLEMENTAL APPENDIX alongside the
REJECTED EXHIBITS that the court refused to take today, as well as the additional supplemental materials which will be
included in the mandamus petition that you have not been served yet.
A copy of these materials would have been provided via the EFM, but given the rejection and lack of explanation or
statutory authority warranting such rejection, they will be served to you here given both email addresses in receipt are the
ones used in our official case pleadings.
Have a good evening,
Charlie
