Re:    Court of Appeals Number: 02-25-00166-CV 
       Trial Court Case Number: 322-744263-23 
Subject: Related case notice and trial court actions 
Dear Ms. Hodges,   
This letter is filed pursuant to rule 9.6 of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure. 
The undersigned acknowledges the recent involvement of the Texas Attorney 
General’s office and reiterates that the instant matter has two additional mandamus 
proceedings involving the same parties. (02-25-00164-CV, 02-25-00171-CV). 
Furthermore, the trial court below (322nd) continues to risk further procedural 
errors by moving to set court proceedings outside the bounds of the Texas Rules of 
Civil Procedure through informal email notifications. 
This letter serves as formal notice of concern that the trial court’s recent actions 
risk further procedural error and may necessitate additional appellate or emergency 
relief. This letter is submitted to apprise the Court of these developments and 
preserve the record should further filings become necessary. 
An objection has been duly filed in the trial court and served on all parties of 
record. 
Respectfully submitted,

Current issues 
Currently, there are several issues that remain unaddressed that need to be resolved: 
1. The entire case foundation is fraudulent due to Petitioner’s pleadings.
2. The undersigned has sought relief from this situation since March 14, 2024,
when the original orders issued on January 16, 2024, which removed the
undersigned from his home without the required findings, were leveraged into
a settlement agreement that was not consented to by all of the parties and did
not serve the best interests of the children.
3. COOPER L. CARTER’s authority remains in question, and her inactivity
combined with the ambiguity surrounding her representation must be
addressed.
4. The undersigned has been forced to live in transient housing and incur
extraordinary damages to his business operations due to the Petitioners
fraudulent allegations which were never supported by evidence.
5. The children in this matter continue to suffer ongoing and irreparable harm
from being separated from their father unjustifiably.
6. There is no child support set up for the children.
Informal service 
Furthermore, the court continues to issue notices informally through the court 
coordinator, which is improper.

service if the email address is on file with the EFM. Texas courts have consistently held that 
electronic service must be made through the EFM when the recipient's email address is 
registered there. The undersigned’s email is registered with the EFM. 
Conclusion 
Because the undersigned has an email on file with the EFM, there is no court order 
requiring alternative service, and there is no agreement waiving formal service, any notice of 
court proceedings not in compliance with rule 21a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure is 
improper.  
Furthermore, because there are several issues that remain unaddressed, such as COOPER 
CARTER’S authority, the ongoing mandamus proceedings, the ongoing irreparable harm to the 
children, and the facially void orders which have caused detrimental effects to the undersigned, 
the risk of these issues creating future delays remains high. 
The undersigned is prepared to challenge any adverse actions taken against him in the 
face of these issues and will seek relief until this matter is resolved in accordance with the 
principles of fairness and justice. The undersigned requests that the court stay all future 
proceedings until the above matters are resolved.

service if the email address is on file with the EFM. Texas courts have consistently held that
electronic service must be made through the EFM when the recipient's email address is

registered there. The undersigned’s email is registered with the EFM.

Conclusion

Because the undersigned has an email on file with the EFM, there is no court order
requiring alternative service, and there is no agreement waiving formal service, any notice of
court proceedings not in compliance with rule 21a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure is

improper.

Furthermore, because there are several issues that remain unaddressed, such as COOPER
CARTER’S authority, the ongoing mandamus proceedings, the ongoing irreparable harm to the
children, and the facially void orders which have caused detrimental effects to the undersigned,

the risk of these issues creating future delays remains high.

The undersigned is prepared to challenge any adverse actions taken against him in the
face of these issues and will seek relief until this matter is resolved in accordance with the
principles of fairness and justice. The undersigned requests that the court stay all future

proceedings until the above matters are resolved.

Respectfully submitted,

I. INTRODUCTION
Petitioner filed a divorce petition under Title 5 of the Texas Family Code on December 
18, 2023. That petition did not seek exclusive possession of the residence or ask that Respondent 
be excluded from the home. Shortly thereafter, on December 22, 2023, Petitioner filed a separate 
Application for Protective Order under Title 4 of the Family Code, in which she explicitly 
requested exclusive possession of the home, removal of Respondent, and child support. The 
Court consolidated the protective‐order case into the divorce case.  
On January 16, 2024, the court—without holding an evidentiary hearing or finding family 
violence—entered Temporary Orders granting Petitioner exclusive possession of the home and 
primary custody and child support, and requiring Respondent to vacate the residence that same 
day. No protective order was ever issued and no findings of family violence were made, even 
though Tex. Fam. Code §§ 83.006 and 85.001 plainly require such findings. In the weeks that 
followed, the court continued these arrangements and ultimately entered “Agreed” Temporary 
Orders (March 26, 2024) allocating parenting time and support. All of these extreme orders were 
based solely on Petitioner’s Title 4 application (and allegations of family violence), and no 
amendments to the pleadings were ever filed to convert the case into a Title 5 SAPCR. 
Respondent never received any notice or hearing on custody, possession, or support issues under 
Title 5. 
II. Legal Standards
The trial court’s authority is strictly limited by the statutes and pleadings. It may consider 
only the claims and relief expressly pleaded by the parties, and must follow the Family Code’s 
procedures for protective orders and SAPCRs. Subject‐matter jurisdiction is a threshold issue: if

I. INTRODUCTION

Petitioner filed a divorce petition under Title 5 of the Texas Family Code on December
18, 2023. That petition did not seek exclusive possession of the residence or ask that Respondent
be excluded from the home. Shortly thereafter, on December 22, 2023, Petitioner filed a separate
Application for Protective Order under Title 4 of the Family Code, in which she explicitly
requested exclusive possession of the home, removal of Respondent, and child support. The

Court consolidated the protective-order case into the divorce case.

On January 16, 2024, the court—without holding an evidentiary hearing or finding family
violence—entered Temporary Orders granting Petitioner exclusive possession of the home and
primary custody and child support, and requiring Respondent to vacate the residence that same
day. No protective order was ever issued and no findings of family violence were made, even
though Tex. Fam. Code §§ 83.006 and 85.001 plainly require such findings. In the weeks that

Title 5.

II. Legal Standards

The trial court’s authority is strictly limited by the statutes and pleadings. It may consider
only the claims and relief expressly pleaded by the parties, and must follow the Family Code’s

procedures for protective orders and SAPCRs. Subject-matter jurisdiction is a threshold issue: if

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the court acted beyond the law, its orders are void. A plea to the jurisdiction is decided as a 
matter of law when the relevant facts are undisputed (see Tex. Dep’t of Parks & Wildlife v. 
Miranda, 133 S.W.3d 217, 228 (Tex. 2004)). Here, the material jurisdictional facts are not in 
dispute. 
III. Title 4 (Protective Order) Proceedings Cannot Support Custody or Support
Under Texas law, a protective‐order proceeding (Title 4) is not a custody (SAPCR) 
proceeding (Title 5). The San Antonio Court of Appeals recently reaffirmed that without a proper 
SAPCR petition under Title 5, a court may not award conservatorship, possession, or support. In 
Rivera v. Figueroa (Tex. App.–San Antonio 2019), the court held that orders issued in a 
protective‐order case cannot support conservatorship or child‐support relief unless a Title 5 
petition was filed and noticed. Likewise, In re Sheffield, 639 S.W.2d 270 (Tex. App.–Dallas 
1982), long held that Title 4 and Title 5 proceedings are jurisdictionally separate: “a court may 
not grant relief beyond the scope of the protective‐order statute without compliance with the 
SAPCR statutes” (sheffield, 639 S.W.2d at 272-73). Here, Petitioner’s December 22 Title 4 
application was never amended or converted into a Title 5 petition. Respondent never waived 
notice or a hearing on conservatorship/possession issues. The court’s decision to exclude 
Respondent from the home and divest him of custody on January 16, 2024 therefore had no 
jurisdictional basis. In short, “[w]ithout a valid protective order in place, the court lacked 
jurisdiction to continue enforcing the extreme relief originally granted”. 
IV. Statutory Prerequisites for Exclusion and Protective Orders Were Not Met
Even if the court treated the relief as a protective‐order, the Family Code’s strict 
requirements were ignored. Tex. Fam. Code § 83.006(a) permits exclusion of a party from the

dispute.

Ill. Title 4 (Protective Order) Proceedings Cannot Support Custody or Support

Under Texas law, a protective-order proceeding (Title 4) is not a custody (SAPCR)
proceeding (Title 5). The San Antonio Court of Appeals recently reaffirmed that without a proper
SAPCR petition under Title 5, a court may not award conservatorship, possession, or support. In
Rivera v. Figueroa (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2019), the court held that orders issued in a
protective-order case cannot support conservatorship or child-support relief unless a Title 5
petition was filed and noticed. Likewise, In re Sheffield, 639 S.W.2d 270 (Tex. App.—Dallas
1982), long held that Title 4 and Title 5 proceedings are jurisdictionally separate: “a court may
not grant relief beyond the scope of the protective-order statute without compliance with the
SAPCR statutes” (sheffield, 639 S.W.2d at 272-73). Here, Petitioner’s December 22 Title 4

home only if (1) the applicant files a sworn affidavit describing facts requiring exclusion, and (2) 
appears at the hearing to testify on those facts. Section 83.006(b) further requires that the court 
make three findings: (i) the applicant resides (or recently resided) at the premises, (ii) the other 
party committed family violence within the past 30 days, and (iii) there is a clear and present 
danger of future family violence. Likewise, § 85.001(a) mandates that at the close of a 
protective‐order hearing, the court must explicitly find whether family violence occurred. If so, 
the court “shall” issue a protective order against the perpetrator. In this case, none of these 
prerequisites were satisfied. Petitioner did file an application and affidavit, but no hearing on 
January 16 (or thereafter) produced any finding of family violence. The court did not issue a 
protective order as the statute requires, and instead simply extended the eviction and custody 
restrictions indefinitely. By failing to hold a hearing, make any family‐violence finding, or enter 
a protective order, the court “bypass[ed] the statutory prerequisites” entirely. Without those 
statutorily required findings, the January 16 “kick‐out” and custody order was outside the court’s 
power. 
V. All Orders Exceeding the Pleadings or Statutory Authority Are Void
It is a bedrock rule that a Texas court must confine its rulings to the relief requested by 
the pleadings and authorized by statute. Any order beyond that scope is void. The Houston First 
Court of Appeals has stated that “[a]n order purporting to grant relief beyond the pleadings is 
void ab initio”. In Guillory v. Boykins, 442 S.W.3d 682, 690 (Tex. App.–Houston [1st Dist.] 
2014, no pet.), the court held that where a trial court lacks jurisdiction or statutory authority to 
grant the relief, the order is void. Similarly, In re P.M.G., 405 S.W.3d 406, 416–17 (Tex. App.–
Texarkana 2013, no pet.), confirms that orders entered without pleadings or outside statutory 
scope are null. Here, not only did the protective‐order pleadings not include any SAPCR claims,

home only if (1) the applicant files a sworn affidavit describing facts requiring exclusion, and (2)
appears at the hearing to testify on those facts. Section 83.006(b) further requires that the court
make three findings: (i) the applicant resides (or recently resided) at the premises, (11) the other
party committed family violence within the past 30 days, and (iii) there is a clear and present
danger of future family violence. Likewise, § 85.001(a) mandates that at the close of a
protective-order hearing, the court must explicitly find whether family violence occurred. If so,
the court “shall” issue a protective order against the perpetrator. In this case, none of these
prerequisites were satisfied. Petitioner did file an application and affidavit, but no hearing on

power.

V. All Orders Exceeding the Pleadings or Statutory Authority Are Void

It is a bedrock rule that a Texas court must confine its rulings to the relief requested by
the pleadings and authorized by statute. Any order beyond that scope is void. The Houston First
Court of Appeals has stated that “[a]n order purporting to grant relief beyond the pleadings is
void ab initio”. In Guillory v. Boykins, 442 S.W.3d 682, 690 (Tex. App.—Houston [Ist Dist. ]
2014, no pet.), the court held that where a trial court lacks jurisdiction or statutory authority to
grant the relief, the order is void. Similarly, Jn re PM.G., 405 S.W.3d 406, 416-17 (Tex. App.—
Texarkana 2013, no pet.), confirms that orders entered without pleadings or outside statutory

scope are null. Here, not only did the protective-order pleadings not include any SAPCR claims,

=== PAGE 23 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
but the later “agreed” orders on March 26, 2024 were not signed or even consented to by 
Respondent (violating Tex. R. Civ. P. 11). In short, every custody and exclusion order in this case 
was “predicated on a void order”. As the Second Court of Appeals recognized in In re C.L., 933 
S.W.2d 402, 405 (Tex. App.–Fort Worth 1996, no writ), an order that is void ab initio “cannot 
form the basis for any valid subsequent judgment”.  That’s exactly what is happening here. The 
court is now moving to finalize fraud, constitutional deprivation, and is trying to finalize its’ 
original excision of Respondent’s constitutional rights. The court cannot destroy a family and 
then move to finalize that without a lawful basis, and over orders that are fundamentally void. 
IV. Violation of Respondent’s Constitutional Rights to Due Process and Family Integrity
The trial court’s actions not only violated statute but also trampled Respondent’s 
fundamental constitutional rights. By evicting the Respondent from his home and effectively 
separating him from his children with no prior notice or opportunity to be heard, the court 
deprived him of liberty and property without due process of law. This violates Article I, § 19 of 
the Texas Constitution (the “due course of law” guarantee) and the Fourteenth Amendment to 
the U.S. Constitution. Now, the court seeks to finalize this fundamental error amidst an ongoing 
appeal, showing a continuous and complete disregard for the Respondent’s rights.  
A. Deprivation of Property Without Due Process
The January 16 order forced Respondent to vacate his own home on the same day it was 
issued. A person’s right to occupy their home is a significant property interest, protected by due 
process. Yet Respondent was ousted immediately, with no notice that such relief would be sought 
and no chance to contest the allegations. The Texas Constitution and the 14th Amendment both 
forbid the State from depriving any person of property without due process of law. Fuentes v. 
Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 81-82 (1972) (even temporary, non-final deprivations of property require

but the later “agreed” orders on March 26, 2024 were not signed or even consented to by

was “predicated on a void order”. As the Second Court of Appeals recognized in In re C.L., 933

issued. A person’s right to occupy their home is a significant property interest, protected by due

and no chance to contest the allegations. The Texas Constitution and the 14° Amendment both
forbid the State from depriving any person of property without due process of law. Fuentes v.

notice and hearing absent extraordinary circumstances). While Texas law does allow ex parte 
orders in truly exigent circumstances, those orders must be narrowly tailored and followed 
promptly by a full hearing. Here, the statutory requirements for an ex parte kick-out were 
disregarded, and Respondent was left homeless and separated from his belongings based on one-
sided assertions. This is precisely the kind of state action that due process is meant to guard 
against. 
B. Deprivation of Parental Rights Without Due Process
Even more critically, the court’s orders infringed Respondent’s fundamental right to 
parent his children, also without due process. A parent’s interest in the care, custody, and control 
of their children is fundamental. The United States Supreme Court has recognized that “the 
interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children…is perhaps the oldest of the 
fundamental liberty interests recognized by this Court.” Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 
(2000) (plurality op.). Likewise, the Texas Supreme Court has affirmed that “the fundamental 
right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children” is 
constitutionally protected. In re C.J.C., 603 S.W.3d 804, 811 (Tex. 2020) (citing Troxel, 530 U.S. 
at 66). Governmental interference with this right is subject to strict scrutiny and must be 
accomplished only with rigorous procedural safeguards. 
Here, Respondent’s removal from the home effectively altered custody of the children 
without any hearing or finding of unfitness. Respondent went from being an equal managing 
conservator of the children to having zero possession or access (by virtue of being excluded from 
the home and the children’s presence) overnight and without notice. This is a profound 
deprivation of parental rights. As the U.S. Supreme Court held in Stanley v. Illinois, an unwed 
father could not be presumed unfit and have his children taken without a hearing – “the Due

notice and hearing absent extraordinary circumstances). While Texas law does allow ex parte
orders in truly exigent circumstances, those orders must be narrowly tailored and followed
promptly by a full hearing. Here, the statutory requirements for an ex parte kick-out were
disregarded, and Respondent was left homeless and separated from his belongings based on one-
sided assertions. This is precisely the kind of state action that due process is meant to guard

against.

B. Deprivation of Parental Rights Without Due Process

Even more critically, the court’s orders infringed Respondent’s fundamental right to
parent his children, also without due process. A parent’s interest in the care, custody, and control
of their children is fundamental. The United States Supreme Court has recognized that “the
interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children...is perhaps the oldest of the
fundamental liberty interests recognized by this Court.” Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65
(2000) (plurality op.). Likewise, the Texas Supreme Court has affirmed that “the fundamental
right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children” is
constitutionally protected. In re C_J.C., 603 S.W.3d 804, 811 (Tex. 2020) (citing Troxel, 530 U.S.
at 66). Governmental interference with this right is subject to strict scrutiny and must be

accomplished only with rigorous procedural safeguards.

Here, Respondent’s removal from the home effectively altered custody of the children
without any hearing or finding of unfitness. Respondent went from being an equal managing
conservator of the children to having zero possession or access (by virtue of being excluded from
the home and the children’s presence) overnight and without notice. This is a profound
deprivation of parental rights. As the U.S. Supreme Court held in Stanley v. Illinois, an unwed

father could not be presumed unfit and have his children taken without a hearing — “the Due

Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that [a father] be given a hearing on 
his fitness as a parent before his children are removed from his custody.” Stanley v. Illinois, 405 
U.S. 645, 649 (1972) (emphasis added). The State “cannot, consistently with due process, 
merely presume” a parent’s unfitness or danger and bypass a hearing; “parental unfitness 
must be established on the basis of individualized proof” before a child is taken away. Id. at 
647, 649. Yet in Respondent’s case, the court did exactly what Stanley forbids – it presumed the 
necessity of removing the father, without any adversarial testing of the evidence or finding of 
actual misconduct and left the determination for later (a hearing that kept getting postponed). 
This violated Respondent’s procedural due process rights to be heard before being deprived of 
custody of his children. 
Moreover, the substantive aspect of due process was violated. There is a “strong 
presumption that the best interest of a child is served by remaining with a fit parent.” Troxel, 
530 U.S. at 68-69. The government may not “infringe on the fundamental right of parents to 
make child rearing decisions simply because a state judge believes a ‘better decision’ could 
be made.” Id. at 72 (plurality op.). In the absence of any evidence or finding that Respondent 
was an unfit or dangerous parent, removing his children from him was an arbitrary infringement 
on his fundamental liberty interest. The orders entered in this case prioritized a one-sided 
allegation over a father’s constitutional rights, in a manner repugnant to both the Texas and U.S. 
Constitutions. Article I, Section 19 of the Texas Constitution guarantees that no citizen shall be 
deprived of liberty or property except by the due course of the law of the land – here, 
Respondent was deprived of both without the lawful procedures or any adjudication of 
wrongdoing.

In sum, the process (or lack thereof) employed by the court fell far short of constitutional 
requirements. This constitutional infirmity is independently sufficient to render the court’s orders 
void. A judgment entered in violation of due process is void and subject to collateral attack. 
Peralta v. Heights Medical Center, Inc., 485 U.S. 80, 84-85 (1988) (judgment rendered without 
proper notice violates due process and is void). The proper remedy for a void order that stems 
from a due process violation is to declare it a nullity and dismiss any action that cannot proceed 
without it. 
VI. Plea to the Jurisdiction Must Be Granted
The undisputed record shows no factual or legal basis for the court’s jurisdiction over the 
extreme relief granted. Under Miranda v. Texas Dept. of Parks & Wildlife, a plea to the 
jurisdiction should be granted as a matter of law if the jurisdictional facts are undisputed or 
uncontroverted by competent evidence. Here, there is no genuine issue that (a) no protective 
order was issued and no findings of family violence were made, (b) no Title 5 SAPCR notice of 
hearing exists on the record, or was ever on file, and (c) all of Petitioner’s requests for home 
exclusion and support were styled under Title 4 and unsupported by any pleaded conservatorship 
claim. The court cannot “proceed further on the merits” without first resolving these fundamental 
defects. Because these jurisdictional defects are purely legal, a full evidentiary hearing is 
unnecessary – the Court should rule as a matter of law that it never had authority to enter any of 
the challenged orders, vacate them accordingly, and allow the status quo to reset. Additionally, 
the March 14, 2024, orders are a mere extension of the initial orders, which claim consent where 
consent is not present. These orders must be vacated as a matter of law as this court has no power 
to rule on void orders.

TO THE HONORABLE DAVID L. EVANS OF THE 8TH ADMINISTRATIVE 
JUDICIAL REGION OF TEXAS:  
This Court's impartiality is now irrevocably in question. The act of 
setting this case for final trial after sustaining over a year of irreparable harm while 
appellate proceedings remain unresolved is itself an act of partiality warranting 
mandatory recusal pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(b)(1) and 18b(b)(2) on the 
grounds that the partiality of the tribunal is reasonably in question, and there is a 
clear personal bias and prejudice exhibited towards the undersigned. 
I. TIMELINESS 
The timeliness of this motion comes three days before a scheduled court 
proceeding, which is intended to “set the case for final trial and to enter a pre-trial 
scheduling order”.(TAB A) However, this flies in the face of three concurrent 
mandamus proceedings pending before the Second Court of Appeals, which 
concurrently seek redress for 1) the refusal of Hon. Kate Stone to hear a properly 
filed emergency TRO (No. 02-25-00164-CV), to seek vacatur of the orders issued 
beyond the court’s jurisdiction by Hon. Jeff Kaitcer on March 14, 2024 (No. 02-25-
00166-CV), (TAB B) and to reverse an improper consolidation motion granted sua 
sponte by Hon. Kenneth Newell. (No. 02-25-00171-CV) All three mandamus 
petitions are at the en banc rehearing stage, except for cause number 02-25-00166-
CV which was denied per curiam on April 24, 2024.

TO THE HONORABLE DAVID L. EVANS OF THE 8!" ADMINISTRATIVE
JUDICIAL REGION OF TEXAS:

This Court's impartiality is now irrevocably in question. The act of
setting this case for final trial after sustaining over a year of irreparable harm while
appellate proceedings remain unresolved is itself an act of partiality warranting
mandatory recusal pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(b)(1) and 18b(b)(2) on the
grounds that the partiality of the tribunal is reasonably in question, and there is a
clear personal bias and prejudice exhibited towards the undersigned.

I. TIMELINESS

The timeliness of this motion comes three days before a scheduled court
proceeding, which is intended to “set the case for final trial and to enter a pre-trial
scheduling order’.(TAB A) However, this flies in the face of three concurrent
mandamus proceedings pending before the Second Court of Appeals, which
concurrently seek redress for 1) the refusal of Hon. Kate Stone to hear a properly

filed emergency TRO (No. 02-25-00164-CV), to seek vacatur of the orders issued

beyond the court’s jurisdiction by Hon. Jeff Kaitcer on March 14, 2024 (No. 02-25-

00166-CV), (TAB B) and to reverse an improper consolidation motion granted sua

sponte by Hon. Kenneth Newell. (No. 02-25-00171-CV) All three mandamus

petitions are at the en banc rehearing stage, except for cause number (2-25-00 166-

CV which was denied per curiam on April 24, 2024.

Despite the upcoming setting, the exception pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 
18a(b)(1)(B)(i) applies. The act of scheduling this matter for final trial itself 
constitutes grounds for recusal by casting doubt upon the tribunal's impartiality. 
The undersigned could not have anticipated that this final trial setting would 
suddenly arise amidst ongoing appellate proceedings, especially given that the case 
has remained inactive since September of 2024. 
Significantly, the opposing party has only recently re-engaged with the case 
after emergency relief was requested by the undersigned in the 233rd District Court 
due to the continuing harm inflicted upon him and his children by these unresolved 
issues. Thus, this abrupt effort to proceed with final trial under the prevailing 
circumstances starkly demonstrates judicial bias, further reinforcing the necessity 
of recusal at this juncture. 
II. PRIOR RECUSAL
The undersigned must also note that this marks the second recusal motion 
filed in this case, the first occurring on October 7, 2024, which was denied on 
November 7, 2024, by visiting retiring Justice Gabriel.(TAB C) The motion was 
denied stating a “failure to appear”, however, all parties agreed to reset the case to 
a later due to a dental emergency sustained by the undersigned.(TAB D) There was 
no mention of this emergency in the order. Finally, it wasn’t until over four months 
later that the judges were reinstated back into the case, because the undersigned

had to remind the court coordinator when seeking a ruling on his still un-opposed 
summary judgement that’s been on the docket since February 22, 2024, to reinstate 
Hon. Munford and Hon. Kaitcer.(TAB E) Had the undersigned not proactively 
reached out, there wasn’t any indication that the reinstatement would have 
occurred. 
III. PROCEDURE
The correct procedural framework required in these proceedings, particularly 
considering the irregular handling of prior matters, must be restated here: 
First, pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(e)(1), “…the clerk of the court must 
immediately deliver a copy to the respondent judge and to the presiding judge of 
the administrative judicial region in which the court is located.” Therefore, the 
undersigned formally objects to any handling from the court coordinator 
regarding these proceedings. In the prior matter there were amended referrals, 
modified pleadings, and an otherwise straightforward process became ambiguous. 
(TAB F) 
Second, pursuant to Id. 18a(e)(2): “[w]hen a respondent judge signs and 
files an order of recusal or referral, the clerk of the court must immediately deliver 
a copy to the regional presiding judge.” The same applies here as to point one. No 
disrespect is intended; this assertion is made solely insofar as the governing statute 
confers no such authority to court coordinators.

Third, pursuant to Id. 18a(g)(6)(C), the undersigned respectfully requests 
that this matter be set for hearing by telephone at the earliest practicable time, 
considering the undersigned’s current financial hardship and lack of stable 
residence. The nature and complexity of the underlying issues are not easily 
reducible to writing, which is precisely why this matter has suffered from 
prolonged procedural silence rather than meaningful discussion grounded in the 
record. A telephonic hearing is necessary to afford the Court a clearer 
understanding of the facts and to ensure due process is meaningfully observed. 
Fourth, should this motion be granted, the undersigned respectfully requests 
that this case be reassigned to an entirely different judicial district, given that both 
the 233rd and 322nd District Courts are presided over by judges directly 
implicated in the procedural and constitutional irregularities described herein. 
Fifth, if the Honorable Regional Presiding Judge chooses to refer this 
motion, the undersigned requests that the alternative language of Id.18a(g)(1) be 
exercised so that the motion may be referred to the Chief Justice of the Supreme 
Court of Texas given the circumstances of this matter, as explained in more detail 
below. 
Finally, pursuant to Id. 18a(f)(1)(A), the undersigned respectfully urges the 
Honorable James B. Munford to voluntarily recuse himself in order to avoid 
further delay and to restore confidence in the fair and impartial administration of

justice, or in the alternative, vacate the March 14, 2024 orders for want of 
consent, and set cause number #322-744263-23 for a pre-trial conference no 
later than 14-days from the decision, effectively rendering moot these recusal 
proceeding.  
The persistent and unexplained judicial inaction—particularly in the face of 
repeated requests for emergency relief—has caused ongoing, irreparable harm to 
the undersigned and his minor children. Such circumstances are fundamentally 
incompatible with both the due process protections guaranteed by law and the best 
interest standard governing all family law proceedings in this State. There is no 
logic in proceeding to final trial in the current circumstance. One party cannot 
unilaterally decide the matter, especially when they remain silent in the face of 
serious, un-rebutted allegations.   
IV. GROUNDS FOR RECUSAL 
A. STANDARD FOR RECUSAL 
A motion to recuse is the appropriate procedural mechanism to challenge a 
judge’s impartiality. Sanchez v. State, 926 S.W.2d 391, 394 (Tex. App.—El Paso 
1996, pet. ref’d). Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(a), any party may file 
a verified motion stating with particularity the grounds upon which the presiding 
judge should not sit.

In addition to the statutory bases for recusal, the Due Process Clause of the 
Fourteenth Amendment provides an independent constitutional floor: recusal is 
required where the probability of actual bias is too high to be constitutionally 
tolerable. Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U.S. 868, 872 (2009) (citing 
Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U.S. 35, 47 (1975)). That standard is met where, under the 
totality of circumstances, a judge’s continued participation creates an unacceptable 
risk of bias—whether due to prior involvement, one-sided procedures, or 
unchecked discretion applied to the detriment of one party. 
Here, the cumulative record demonstrates a pattern of prejudice, one-sided 
decision-making, and disregard for both procedure and fundamental rights, rising 
well beyond the constitutional threshold described in Caperton. Recusal is not 
merely appropriate—it is required, as explained below. 
B. BIAS 
The level of bias against the undersigned started on day one. Without any 
factual basis, without holding an evidentiary hearing, and without eliciting any 
testimony from the Petitioner, the undersigned was ordered to vacate the residence 
that same day. (TAB F) No protective order was ever issued, no findings of family 
violence were made, even though Tex. Fam. Code §§ 83.006 and 85.001 plainly 
require such findings.

This decision, even though temporarily, severed the parent-child relationship 
without any lawful basis. The Family Code’s strict requirements were ignored. Tex. 
Fam. Code § 83.006(a) permits exclusion of a party from the home only if (1) the 
applicant files an affidavit describing facts requiring exclusion, and (2) appears at 
the hearing to testify to those facts. Section 83.006(b) further requires that the court 
make three findings: (i) the applicant resides (or recently resided) at the premises, 
(ii) the other party committed family violence within the past 30 days, and (iii) 
there is a clear and present danger of future family violence. 
The only thing before the court were allegations of family violence, which 
were never substantiated. Rather, they were leveraged into a settlement agreement 
that removed the children from their own home in February of 2024. (TAB G) A 
court cannot sever a parent-child bond on mere allegations. Tex. Fam Code 
153.002. Yet here, that’s what has occurred, and the undersigned has sought 
answers from this court – and has received nothing but complete silence.  
Now, over fourteen months later, a facially invalid consent judgement has 
been permitted to destroy the lives of not only the undersigned – but his children, 
all while enabling the Petitioner, MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS, to get away 
with her deliberate scheme to undermine the judiciary that remains un-opposed on 
the face of the record. A cursory glance at page 1 versus page 38 of an excerpt of

repugnant to both the Texas and U.S. Constitutions, which guarantee that no citizen 
shall be deprived of liberty or property except by the due course of the law of the 
land. Here, Respondent was deprived of liberty and property interests without 
lawful procedures or any adjudication of wrongdoing, in violation these 
fundamental protections. U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. Further, no equal 
protection or due course of law has been afforded to the undersigned, 
demonstrating further unexplained bias, in violation of Tex. Const. art. I, §§ 3, 19. 
C. PREJUDICIAL DOCKET MANAGEMENT
A court has the inherent authority to control its own docket. See Ho v.
University of Texas at Arlington, 984 S.W.2d 672, 694-95 (Tex.App.-Amarillo 
1998, pet. denied) Whether a reasonable period has lapsed in which to rule on a 
pending matter is dependent on the circumstances of each case. Ex parte Bates, 65 
S.W.3d 133, 134-35 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2001, orig. proceeding). Other factors 
considered in determining whether a reasonable time has passed are the state of the 
trial court's docket and other judicial and administrative duties that must be 
addressed. In re Villarreal, 96 S.W.3d 708, 711 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2003, orig. 
proceeding). 
Here, in this matter, the undersigned has dispositive motions on the docket 
that would afford him the much-needed relief, yet the court chooses to prioritize 
motions that favor the opposition. For example, the oldest sitting motion is a

S.W.3d 133, 134-35 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2001, orig. proceeding). Other factors
considered in determining whether a reasonable time has passed are the state of the
trial court's docket and other judicial and administrative duties that must be
addressed. In re Villarreal, 96 S.W.3d 708, 711 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2003, orig.

proceeding).

Here, in this matter, the undersigned has dispositive motions on the docket
that would afford him the much-needed relief, yet the court chooses to prioritize
motions that favor the opposition. For example, the oldest sitting motion is a

Motion for Summary Judgement filed on Feb 22, 2024, seeking to defeat the 
baseless claims of violence that were raised him at the onset of this case.  
Next, there exists a pending Rule 12 Motion challenging COOPER L. 
CARTER’s authority, counsel for Petitioner in this matter. Despite this, she 
interrupted emergency proceedings in the 233rd District Court, leading to the 
mandamus proceedings that neither the tribunal nor opposing side has participated 
in, but continues to act sua sponte to give the illusion of an adequate remedy for an 
appeal when the threshold issues remain.  
Finally, there exists a pending DWOP motion and motion to compel 
discovery on the docket, pending for several months – unaddressed – showing no 
respect for the process by the opposing side. In In re Conner, 458 S.W.3d 532 (Tex. 
2015) the Texas Supreme Court’s statement that "conclusive presumption of 
abandonment" that arises from unexplained delays indicates that judges must 
actively manage their dockets to prevent such delays or ensure that they are 
adequately explained. Here, there is no explanation for the delays and inaction. The 
opposition has no incentive to move the case forward, as they were awarded on all 
core issues at the onset of the case – for reasons yet to be explained.  
The only party seeking any form of relief has been the undersigned. 
Authorities not only establish judicial responsibility for docket management but 
also provide examples of judges proactively fulfilling this responsibility rather than

blaming litigants for delays. The actions of the Galveston County district judges 
described in Armentrout v. Murdock, 779 S.W.2d 119 (Tex. App. 
1989) and Southern Pacific Transp. Co. v. Stoot, 530 S.W.2d 930 (Tex. 
1975) exemplify this approach. These judges "recognized this problem, took 
responsibility for the condition of their dockets, and moved against the troubles of 
delay" by instituting systems to ensure timely case progression. This example 
demonstrates that effective judges take ownership of their dockets rather than 
deflecting responsibility. 
The responsibility of judges for docket management is further emphasized 
by the accountability measures in place. In re Rose, 144 S.W.3d 661 (Tex. 
2004) demonstrates that judges can face disciplinary action for administrative 
misconduct, including failures related to court management. Judge Rose's own 
acknowledgment that "the responsibility is mine" and "I'm the bottom line" reflects 
the understanding within the judiciary itself that judges bear ultimate responsibility 
for their courts' functioning. 
A plea to the jurisdiction has been filed as of April 24, 2025, to serve as 
another reminder to the court that these orders must be vacated as a matter of law, 
not finalized into finality. (TAB H)

The record in this case reveals a sustained pattern of judicial favoritism 
toward opposing counsel, warranting recusal. In Sun Exploration & Production 
Co. v. Jackson, 783 S.W.2d 202, 204 (Tex. 1989), the Texas Supreme Court 
acknowledged that while individual rulings may not rise to the level of reversible 
error, an appellate court may nonetheless detect from the record a clear pattern of 
favoritism that undermines the appearance of impartiality. 
Recusal is required where such favoritism would cause a reasonable 
observer to doubt the judge’s neutrality. Here the level of favoritism is so high that 
the courts below improperly grant motions sua-sponte without hearings to the 
Petitioner’s benefit, when the same is done to the undersigned to his detriment. As 
the court explained in Guillen v. Cameron County, No. 13-16-00682-CV (Tex. 
App.—Corpus Christi–Edinburg Nov. 15, 2018, no pet.): 
“Recusal is appropriate if a reasonable member of the public at large, 
knowing all the facts in the public domain concerning the judge’s conduct, would 
harbor doubts as to the judge’s impartiality.” That standard is met here. An 
objective observer reviewing the docket would see: 
i. A mother who conducted a deliberate scheme to defraud the judiciary and 
pursue an extramarital affair; 
ii. A father ordered out of his home and children’s daily lives without any 
findings or evidentiary hearing;

remain silent in briefing, only to appear at hearing and object, is both prejudicial 
and professionally improper. Such conduct should not be condoned by the Court, 
particularly when it operates to the detriment of a self-represented parent seeking 
long-delayed relief.  
CONCLUSION  
 
Imagine being labeled a criminal—accused of abuse—while a court is told 
that a protective order already exists against you. Imagine that the very person you 
supported for years and who benefitted from your success suddenly claims 
financial indigence, asserts full responsibility for all expenses, and serves you—at 
Christmas—with allegations designed to remove you from your home, your 
children, and your livelihood. Now imagine this: You built a business from home—
intentionally, strategically—so that you could raise your children and be a present 
father, not just a provider. You tailored your entire life around being there for them. 
Now imagine the State—without lawful authority—rips that life away. No 
hearing. No findings. No emergency. No evidence. And then the State does 
nothing. It sits on its hands while you fight, alone, for over fifteen months—
pleading for relief, receiving only silence. And the reason? There isn’t one that 
can be traced to the record, meaning it must be extrajudicial and derived from 
actual bias. There exists no basis for the current orders to remain in effect, yet they 
are. The court chooses to act sua sponte only when it benefits the opposing party.

In a world where you take the initiative of showing up, ready to defend 
yourself—your family, your home, your rights—only for those rights to be stripped 
away in the blink of an eye before being afforded the chance to defend yourself. 
No process. No fairness. No law.  
Is that how justice works? Is that how a divorce should begin? Because that 
is exactly what happened here. This is more than a denial of due process. This is 
a system abandoning its core duty to protect children and uphold the law. This 
is a constitutional wound—one that continues to bleed with every day this court 
refuses to act. This recusal must be granted as a matter of law—not just to restore 
fairness, but to prevent this travesty from becoming permanent. Each day this 
continues is another day of unexplained, avoidable suffering inflicted on the 
children at the center of this case while the opposing side sits in silence. The court 
has an obligation to conduct their operations within the bounds of the law and 
protect the family unit. Here, this court took no issue in destroying it from the 
onset. 
Therefore, notwithstanding the docket management and favoritism displayed 
towards the opposing party, the pattern of rulings alone showcases a deep-seated 
favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible. Dow Chem.

Subject: RE: Today's hearing at 11 CL-12105
Dear Ms. Baker, and Mr. Carter,
I am writing to respectfully request a rescheduling of today’s recusal hearing due to an unexpected medical issue. Late
last night, I began experiencing severe tooth pain, which has now escalated to significant facial swelling and intense
discomfort. The pain is currently affecting my ability to speak, eat, and focus, making it challenging to fully participate in
today’s proceedings.
Specifically, it's my bottom left molar which the nerve is open and exposed causing significant pain. 
I want to sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, especially given the efforts the court has made to
accommodate this hearing. Please know that this request is made only out of necessity, and I deeply regret the timing as
I would prefer to move the case forward.
This request comes with a high degree of reluctance given the unexpected technical difficulties experienced last time and
would not be making it if it wasn't absolutely necessary.
Thank you all for your understanding and consideration. I am committed to continuing with the hearing at the earliest
possible opportunity as I am eager to move the case forward.
I wanted to inform the court as soon as possible out of respect for the courts busy schedule.
I currently am unable to locate the case on research texas, as I've been trying to file a formal notice but given the time I
wanted to ensure the court was made aware as soon as possible of the situation.
Lines of communication are open for further discussion or if any further information is needed.
With respect,
Charles Myers

Ms. Baker,

My Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, filed February 22, 2024, remains unopposed for over a year. Under TRCP
166a(c) and Local Rule 4.01(d), this motion is ripe for ruling. Opposing counsel's failure to respond waives any objection.

Further, opposing counsel (CC'ed here), cannot prosecute her case in accordance with Texas law, and still has an
outstanding rule 12 motion that is now also unopposed.

Agranting of either motion would resolve the core case issues, and given the circumstances, is duly warranted.
| formally request an immediate ruling or confirmation of when the Court will act. Further delay is unacceptable.

If the judges cannot legally act given opposing counsels failure to comply with Tex. R. CIV. P. 237a, then the matter should
be brought before David L. Evans without delay.

Sincerely,

Charles Dustin Myers

Mr. Dustin:

Prior to providing available dates to set your hearing request, the Court must know how much time you are
requesting for the hearing? Further, you must E-file or personally appear with a Notice of Hearing for the
Court to set the hearing.

Thank you,

If you received a Notice of Dismissal, you MUST file a Motion to Retain. The Motion
MUST be SET, HEARD and concluded with a SIGNED ORDER TO RETAIN.

Hello Lindsey,

| hope you are doing well. | am following up on the Myers v. Myers matter (Cause No. 322-744263-23 in the 322nd District
Court), which was remanded back from federal court on December 17, 2024. As of today, the opposing party still has not
filed the Notice of Remand or otherwise re-engaged with the case. This has left our case in limbo on the court’s docket. In
the meantime, Charles Dustin Myers (Respondent), is suffering ongoing harm each day without the court’s intervention on
pending matters.

To recap the situation briefly:

The federal court remanded the case to state court on 12/17/2024. Under Texas Rule 237a, it was Petitioner’s

responsibility to file the remand order with the clerk and notify us. That never happened. We are now three months post-
M.36364, and the case has not been officially re-docketed due to this oversight. M.3636

Mb363'7.46 PM Gmail - Ruling Requested — Unopposed Summary Judgment (Filed 2/22/2024) — Case No. 322-744263-23 M.3637

| have multiple pending motions that were filed before and after the remand. Critically, Petitioner and her counsel have not
responded to ANY of these motions. For example, the Motion for Summary Judgment (filed 2/26/2024) received no
response. More urgently, our Ex Parte Motion for Child Custody, Exclusive Use of Marital Residence, Contempt, and
Sanctions (filed 2/12/2025) remains unopposed and unaddressed. We also filed a Proposed Order on 2/20/2025 and a
Request for Immediate Ruling on 2/28/2025, with no response from the other side.

The issues in that ex parte motion are time-sensitive and critical: we need a court order for custody and to regain access
to the marital home. Opposing counsel’s failure to follow procedure has effectively stalled relief that desperately needs
attention. (Respondent has been without access to his home and children for an extended period through no fault of his
own). There are also allegations of contempt by the opposing party that have not been heard because of these delays.

Given this extraordinary situation, we respectfully ask the Court to take immediate action. Specifically, we request one of
the following at the Court’s earliest convenience (and we truly mean as soon as possible, even this week if feasible):

Immediate ruling/signing of orders: Since the motions are unopposed, the Court can rule on them without a hearing. |
have a proposed Order for the ex parte motion ready for Judge Kaitcer’s signature. | urge the Court to sign an order
granting Respondent temporary custody of the children and exclusive use of the residence immediately. This would
provide much-needed stability while the case proceeds. Similarly, the motion for summary judgment can be granted on
the papers, as no controverting evidence or response was ever filed by Petitioner.

Emergency hearing: If the Court prefers to hold a hearing, please provide the soonest possible date and time for an
emergency hearing on the Ex Parte Motion (2/12/2025), and a notice will be filed tomorrow. | am prepared to appear on
short notice. Given that the motion is unopposed, the hearing should be brief. Respondent will gladly testify to confirm the
facts if needed. He just needs the Court’s authorization to move forward — every day of delay is another day he is barred
from his home and children.

Filing of Remand Order: To remove any procedural barrier, Respondent will obtain a certified copy of the federal remand
order and he will file it himself (or hand-deliver a copy) to the Court. If the clerk needs that filed separately to officially
reopen the case, please let me know - it will be done immediately. | do not want a clerical formality to stand between the
children and justice any longer.

Sanctions for non-compliance (if appropriate): Resppndent also wants the Court to be aware that opposing counsel’s
conduct — failing to file the remand notice and ignoring court filings — is sanctionable. While the priority is getting relief for
the children, the intent is to address this issue at the appropriate time. For now, this failure should at least not be
rewarded by further delaying proceedings. Respondent shouldn’t have to wait indefinitely due to the other side’s
procedural neglect.

In sum, Respondent is asking for the Court’s help to break the logjam created by the opposing party. Our requests are
straightforward and unopposed. The court has the authority to grant the relief either ex parte or by default given the
circumstances. Respondent is simply requesting that the Court exercise that authority as soon as possible to prevent
further irreparable harm.

My tone in this email is urgent because the situation is urgent. | have been exceedingly patient while trying every avenue
to move this case forward. With each passing day, the situation worsens and the children at issue remain in uncertainty. |
trust that the 322nd District Court strives to resolve such matters fairly and expeditiously, and | am eager to assist in any
way to facilitate a prompt resolution.

Proposed next steps:

If Judge Kaitcer (or the assigned judge) is available to review the file tomorrow, we urge him to sign the proposed Order
(filed 2/20/2025) granting the relief in the 2/12/2025 motion. | am available by phone or email if the Court has any
questions or slight modifications to the order.

Alternatively, please provide a setting for an emergency hearing as early as possible. Even a telephone or Zoom hearing
would be acceptable, given the urgency, if that would expedite the process. A notice of hearing will be filed Monday.

If there are any concerns about the procedural posture (such as the missing Notice of Remand), please let me know. | am
prepared to cure any such issue immediately. | can file the remand order and serve opposing counsel (to the extent she
will accept service) to remove any doubt that the case is properly before the Court.

Thank you very much for your time and attention to this matter, Lindsey. | understand the Court has a busy docket, but
this case has unusual circumstances that warrant special handling. | greatly appreciate any assistance you can provide in
conveying the urgency of this situation to Judge Kaitcer, Judge Munford, or in the alternative, Judge Evans. | am hopeful
that, with the Court’s intervention, we can obtain a ruling or hearing in a matter of days, bringing much-needed relief and
allowing the case to progress.

Court with a formal Notice of Court Proceeding to set each of your E-filed motions. | also informed you of
this in my previous email response. | will take no further action responding to your email communications
unless you are requesting an in person hearing AND provide the Court with a E-filed Notice of Court
Proceeding in compliance with the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Please refer to the Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure, The Texas Family Code, and the Tarrant County Family Court’s Local Rules.

Dear Ms. Baker,
Thanks for your response.
As | previously pointed out, the Order of Assignment from Judge David L. Evans assigned Justice Lee Gabriel to the case.
That assignment remains in effect until Judge Evans issues a written termination order, as stated. To my knowledge, no
such order has been issued or served.
Until that occurs, it would be procedurally improper to request a court hearing, particularly given that the opposing party
has yet to fulfill their obligation under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 237a by filing a Notice of Remand after removal to
federal court.

It would be helpful if these issues could be resolved as soon as possible so that the case can proceed effectively.

Best regards,
Charles Dustin Myers

NO. 322-744263-23 
IN THE 322nd DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
TO THE HONORABLE JAMES MUNFORD: 
The record reveals a pattern of the Court acting beyond its jurisdiction: on January 16, 
2024, the Court ousted Respondent from the marital residence without any finding of family 
violence or protective order; on March 26, 2024, the Court entered “Agreed” Temporary 
Orders without Respondent’s consent, flouting the statutory procedures for entry of such 
orders. These actions violate Respondent’s due process rights and the Texas Family Code. Under 
Texas law, orders issued without jurisdiction or in the absence of a party’s consent are void 
and cannot confer jurisdiction. Respondent asks the Court to recognize these fundamental defects 
and dismiss the current orders as a matter of law. 
Until these orders are resolved, or the court issues written findings regarding their 
legitimacy, Respondent will not appear and risk further deprivation of his rights from this court.

I. INTRODUCTION
Petitioner filed a divorce petition under Title 5 of the Texas Family Code on December 
18, 2023. That petition did not seek exclusive possession of the residence or ask that Respondent 
be excluded from the home. Shortly thereafter, on December 22, 2023, Petitioner filed a separate 
Application for Protective Order under Title 4 of the Family Code, in which she explicitly 
requested exclusive possession of the home, removal of Respondent, and child support. The 
Court consolidated the protective‐order case into the divorce case.  
On January 16, 2024, the court—without holding an evidentiary hearing or finding family 
violence—entered Temporary Orders granting Petitioner exclusive possession of the home and 
primary custody and child support, and requiring Respondent to vacate the residence that same 
day. No protective order was ever issued and no findings of family violence were made, even 
though Tex. Fam. Code §§ 83.006 and 85.001 plainly require such findings. In the weeks that 
followed, the court continued these arrangements and ultimately entered “Agreed” Temporary 
Orders (March 26, 2024) allocating parenting time and support. All of these extreme orders were 
based solely on Petitioner’s Title 4 application (and allegations of family violence), and no 
amendments to the pleadings were ever filed to convert the case into a Title 5 SAPCR. 
Respondent never received any notice or hearing on custody, possession, or support issues under 
Title 5. 
II. Legal Standards
The trial court’s authority is strictly limited by the statutes and pleadings. It may consider 
only the claims and relief expressly pleaded by the parties, and must follow the Family Code’s 
procedures for protective orders and SAPCRs. Subject‐matter jurisdiction is a threshold issue: if

I. INTRODUCTION

Petitioner filed a divorce petition under Title 5 of the Texas Family Code on December
18, 2023. That petition did not seek exclusive possession of the residence or ask that Respondent
be excluded from the home. Shortly thereafter, on December 22, 2023, Petitioner filed a separate
Application for Protective Order under Title 4 of the Family Code, in which she explicitly
requested exclusive possession of the home, removal of Respondent, and child support. The

Court consolidated the protective-order case into the divorce case.

On January 16, 2024, the court—without holding an evidentiary hearing or finding family
violence—entered Temporary Orders granting Petitioner exclusive possession of the home and
primary custody and child support, and requiring Respondent to vacate the residence that same
day. No protective order was ever issued and no findings of family violence were made, even
though Tex. Fam. Code §§ 83.006 and 85.001 plainly require such findings. In the weeks that

based solely on Petitioner’s Title 4 application (and allegations of family violence), and no
amendments to the pleadings were ever filed to convert the case into a Title 5 SAPCR.
Respondent never received any notice or hearing on custody, possession, or support issues under

Title 5.

II. Legal Standards

The trial court’s authority is strictly limited by the statutes and pleadings. It may consider
only the claims and relief expressly pleaded by the parties, and must follow the Family Code’s

procedures for protective orders and SAPCRs. Subject-matter jurisdiction is a threshold issue: if

=== PAGE 94 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the court acted beyond the law, its orders are void. A plea to the jurisdiction is decided as a 
matter of law when the relevant facts are undisputed (see Tex. Dep’t of Parks & Wildlife v. 
Miranda, 133 S.W.3d 217, 228 (Tex. 2004)). Here, the material jurisdictional facts are not in 
dispute. 
III. Title 4 (Protective Order) Proceedings Cannot Support Custody or Support 
Under Texas law, a protective‐order proceeding (Title 4) is not a custody (SAPCR) 
proceeding (Title 5). The San Antonio Court of Appeals recently reaffirmed that without a proper 
SAPCR petition under Title 5, a court may not award conservatorship, possession, or support. In 
Rivera v. Figueroa (Tex. App.–San Antonio 2019), the court held that orders issued in a 
protective‐order case cannot support conservatorship or child‐support relief unless a Title 5 
petition was filed and noticed. Likewise, In re Sheffield, 639 S.W.2d 270 (Tex. App.–Dallas 
1982), long held that Title 4 and Title 5 proceedings are jurisdictionally separate: “a court may 
not grant relief beyond the scope of the protective‐order statute without compliance with the 
SAPCR statutes” (sheffield, 639 S.W.2d at 272-73). Here, Petitioner’s December 22 Title 4 
application was never amended or converted into a Title 5 petition. Respondent never waived 
notice or a hearing on conservatorship/possession issues. The court’s decision to exclude 
Respondent from the home and divest him of custody on January 16, 2024 therefore had no 
jurisdictional basis. In short, “[w]ithout a valid protective order in place, the court lacked 
jurisdiction to continue enforcing the extreme relief originally granted”. 
IV. Statutory Prerequisites for Exclusion and Protective Orders Were Not Met 
Even if the court treated the relief as a protective‐order, the Family Code’s strict 
requirements were ignored. Tex. Fam. Code § 83.006(a) permits exclusion of a party from the

Ill. Title 4 (Protective Order) Proceedings Cannot Support Custody or Support

Under Texas law, a protective-order proceeding (Title 4) is not a custody (SAPCR)
proceeding (Title 5). The San Antonio Court of Appeals recently reaffirmed that without a proper
SAPCR petition under Title 5, a court may not award conservatorship, possession, or support. In
Rivera v. Figueroa (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2019), the court held that orders issued in a
protective-order case cannot support conservatorship or child-support relief unless a Title 5
petition was filed and noticed. Likewise, In re Sheffield, 639 S.W.2d 270 (Tex. App.—Dallas

not grant relief beyond the scope of the protective-order statute without compliance with the
SAPCR statutes” (sheffield, 639 S.W.2d at 272-73). Here, Petitioner’s December 22 Title 4
application was never amended or converted into a Title 5 petition. Respondent never waived

Respondent from the home and divest him of custody on January 16, 2024 therefore had no
jurisdictional basis. In short, “[w]ithout a valid protective order in place, the court lacked

jurisdiction to continue enforcing the extreme relief originally granted”.

IV. Statutory Prerequisites for Exclusion and Protective Orders Were Not Met

Even if the court treated the relief as a protective-order, the Family Code’s strict

requirements were ignored. Tex. Fam. Code § 83.006(a) permits exclusion of a party from the

=== PAGE 95 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
home only if (1) the applicant files a sworn affidavit describing facts requiring exclusion, and (2) 
appears at the hearing to testify on those facts. Section 83.006(b) further requires that the court 
make three findings: (i) the applicant resides (or recently resided) at the premises, (ii) the other 
party committed family violence within the past 30 days, and (iii) there is a clear and present 
danger of future family violence. Likewise, § 85.001(a) mandates that at the close of a 
protective‐order hearing, the court must explicitly find whether family violence occurred. If so, 
the court “shall” issue a protective order against the perpetrator. In this case, none of these 
prerequisites were satisfied. Petitioner did file an application and affidavit, but no hearing on 
January 16 (or thereafter) produced any finding of family violence. The court did not issue a 
protective order as the statute requires, and instead simply extended the eviction and custody 
restrictions indefinitely. By failing to hold a hearing, make any family‐violence finding, or enter 
a protective order, the court “bypass[ed] the statutory prerequisites” entirely. Without those 
statutorily required findings, the January 16 “kick‐out” and custody order was outside the court’s 
power. 
V. All Orders Exceeding the Pleadings or Statutory Authority Are Void
It is a bedrock rule that a Texas court must confine its rulings to the relief requested by 
the pleadings and authorized by statute. Any order beyond that scope is void. The Houston First 
Court of Appeals has stated that “[a]n order purporting to grant relief beyond the pleadings is 
void ab initio”. In Guillory v. Boykins, 442 S.W.3d 682, 690 (Tex. App.–Houston [1st Dist.] 
2014, no pet.), the court held that where a trial court lacks jurisdiction or statutory authority to 
grant the relief, the order is void. Similarly, In re P.M.G., 405 S.W.3d 406, 416–17 (Tex. App.–
Texarkana 2013, no pet.), confirms that orders entered without pleadings or outside statutory 
scope are null. Here, not only did the protective‐order pleadings not include any SAPCR claims,

home only if (1) the applicant files a sworn affidavit describing facts requiring exclusion, and (2)
appears at the hearing to testify on those facts. Section 83.006(b) further requires that the court
make three findings: (i) the applicant resides (or recently resided) at the premises, (11) the other
party committed family violence within the past 30 days, and (iii) there is a clear and present
danger of future family violence. Likewise, § 85.001(a) mandates that at the close of a
protective-order hearing, the court must explicitly find whether family violence occurred. If so,
the court “shall” issue a protective order against the perpetrator. In this case, none of these
prerequisites were satisfied. Petitioner did file an application and affidavit, but no hearing on
January 16 (or thereafter) produced any finding of family violence. The court did not issue a
protective order as the statute requires, and instead simply extended the eviction and custody
restrictions indefinitely. By failing to hold a hearing, make any family-violence finding, or enter
a protective order, the court “bypass[ed] the statutory prerequisites” entirely. Without those
statutorily required findings, the January 16 “kick-out” and custody order was outside the court’s

grant the relief, the order is void. Similarly, Jn re PM.G., 405 S.W.3d 406, 416-17 (Tex. App.—

but the later “agreed” orders on March 26, 2024 were not signed or even consented to by 
Respondent (violating Tex. R. Civ. P. 11). In short, every custody and exclusion order in this case 
was “predicated on a void order”. As the Second Court of Appeals recognized in In re C.L., 933 
S.W.2d 402, 405 (Tex. App.–Fort Worth 1996, no writ), an order that is void ab initio “cannot 
form the basis for any valid subsequent judgment”.  That’s exactly what is happening here. The 
court is now moving to finalize fraud, constitutional deprivation, and is trying to finalize its’ 
original excision of Respondent’s constitutional rights. The court cannot destroy a family and 
then move to finalize that without a lawful basis, and over orders that are fundamentally void. 
IV. Violation of Respondent’s Constitutional Rights to Due Process and Family Integrity 
The trial court’s actions not only violated statute but also trampled Respondent’s 
fundamental constitutional rights. By evicting the Respondent from his home and effectively 
separating him from his children with no prior notice or opportunity to be heard, the court 
deprived him of liberty and property without due process of law. This violates Article I, § 19 of 
the Texas Constitution (the “due course of law” guarantee) and the Fourteenth Amendment to 
the U.S. Constitution. Now, the court seeks to finalize this fundamental error amidst an ongoing 
appeal, showing a continuous and complete disregard for the Respondent’s rights.  
A. Deprivation of Property Without Due Process 
The January 16 order forced Respondent to vacate his own home on the same day it was 
issued. A person’s right to occupy their home is a significant property interest, protected by due 
process. Yet Respondent was ousted immediately, with no notice that such relief would be sought 
and no chance to contest the allegations. The Texas Constitution and the 14th Amendment both 
forbid the State from depriving any person of property without due process of law. Fuentes v. 
Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 81-82 (1972) (even temporary, non-final deprivations of property require

notice and hearing absent extraordinary circumstances). While Texas law does allow ex parte 
orders in truly exigent circumstances, those orders must be narrowly tailored and followed 
promptly by a full hearing. Here, the statutory requirements for an ex parte kick-out were 
disregarded, and Respondent was left homeless and separated from his belongings based on one-
sided assertions. This is precisely the kind of state action that due process is meant to guard 
against. 
B. Deprivation of Parental Rights Without Due Process 
Even more critically, the court’s orders infringed Respondent’s fundamental right to 
parent his children, also without due process. A parent’s interest in the care, custody, and control 
of their children is fundamental. The United States Supreme Court has recognized that “the 
interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children…is perhaps the oldest of the 
fundamental liberty interests recognized by this Court.” Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 
(2000) (plurality op.). Likewise, the Texas Supreme Court has affirmed that “the fundamental 
right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children” is 
constitutionally protected. In re C.J.C., 603 S.W.3d 804, 811 (Tex. 2020) (citing Troxel, 530 U.S. 
at 66). Governmental interference with this right is subject to strict scrutiny and must be 
accomplished only with rigorous procedural safeguards. 
Here, Respondent’s removal from the home effectively altered custody of the children 
without any hearing or finding of unfitness. Respondent went from being an equal managing 
conservator of the children to having zero possession or access (by virtue of being excluded from 
the home and the children’s presence) overnight and without notice. This is a profound 
deprivation of parental rights. As the U.S. Supreme Court held in Stanley v. Illinois, an unwed 
father could not be presumed unfit and have his children taken without a hearing – “the Due

Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that [a father] be given a hearing on 
his fitness as a parent before his children are removed from his custody.” Stanley v. Illinois, 405 
U.S. 645, 649 (1972) (emphasis added). The State “cannot, consistently with due process, 
merely presume” a parent’s unfitness or danger and bypass a hearing; “parental unfitness 
must be established on the basis of individualized proof” before a child is taken away. Id. at 
647, 649. Yet in Respondent’s case, the court did exactly what Stanley forbids – it presumed the 
necessity of removing the father, without any adversarial testing of the evidence or finding of 
actual misconduct and left the determination for later (a hearing that kept getting postponed). 
This violated Respondent’s procedural due process rights to be heard before being deprived of 
custody of his children. 
Moreover, the substantive aspect of due process was violated. There is a “strong 
presumption that the best interest of a child is served by remaining with a fit parent.” Troxel, 
530 U.S. at 68-69. The government may not “infringe on the fundamental right of parents to 
make child rearing decisions simply because a state judge believes a ‘better decision’ could 
be made.” Id. at 72 (plurality op.). In the absence of any evidence or finding that Respondent 
was an unfit or dangerous parent, removing his children from him was an arbitrary infringement 
on his fundamental liberty interest. The orders entered in this case prioritized a one-sided 
allegation over a father’s constitutional rights, in a manner repugnant to both the Texas and U.S. 
Constitutions. Article I, Section 19 of the Texas Constitution guarantees that no citizen shall be 
deprived of liberty or property except by the due course of the law of the land – here, 
Respondent was deprived of both without the lawful procedures or any adjudication of 
wrongdoing.

In sum, the process (or lack thereof) employed by the court fell far short of constitutional 
requirements. This constitutional infirmity is independently sufficient to render the court’s orders 
void. A judgment entered in violation of due process is void and subject to collateral attack. 
Peralta v. Heights Medical Center, Inc., 485 U.S. 80, 84-85 (1988) (judgment rendered without 
proper notice violates due process and is void). The proper remedy for a void order that stems 
from a due process violation is to declare it a nullity and dismiss any action that cannot proceed 
without it. 
VI. Plea to the Jurisdiction Must Be Granted 
The undisputed record shows no factual or legal basis for the court’s jurisdiction over the 
extreme relief granted. Under Miranda v. Texas Dept. of Parks & Wildlife, a plea to the 
jurisdiction should be granted as a matter of law if the jurisdictional facts are undisputed or 
uncontroverted by competent evidence. Here, there is no genuine issue that (a) no protective 
order was issued and no findings of family violence were made, (b) no Title 5 SAPCR notice of 
hearing exists on the record, or was ever on file, and (c) all of Petitioner’s requests for home 
exclusion and support were styled under Title 4 and unsupported by any pleaded conservatorship 
claim. The court cannot “proceed further on the merits” without first resolving these fundamental 
defects. Because these jurisdictional defects are purely legal, a full evidentiary hearing is 
unnecessary – the Court should rule as a matter of law that it never had authority to enter any of 
the challenged orders, vacate them accordingly, and allow the status quo to reset. Additionally, 
the March 14, 2024, orders are a mere extension of the initial orders, which claim consent where 
consent is not present. These orders must be vacated as a matter of law as this court has no power 
to rule on void orders.

record, and will challenge any orders or decisions made prior to the resolution of these issues.

WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Charles Dustin Myers respectfully prays that the 
Court: 
1. Rule, as a matter of law, that the January 16, 2024, exclusion and custody order and all
subsequent temporary orders are void ab initio for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction;
2. Vacate and rescind those orders, and dismiss with prejudice any custody, possession, or
support claims that rest on them; alternatively, dismiss all SAPCR claims for want of
proper pleadings, notice, and jurisdiction;
3. Issue a written ruling on this plea as required by law, and stay all further proceedings in
this case pending resolution of this jurisdictional challenge; and
4. Grant such other and further relief, at law or in equity, to which Respondent may be justly
entitled.

Clarissa Hodges 
Clerk, Second Court of Appeals 
Tim Curry Criminal Justice Center 
401 West Belknap, Suite 9000 
Fort Worth, Texas 76196-0211 
Re:    Court of Appeals Number: 02-25-00164-CV 
       Trial Court Case Number:  233-765358-25
Subject: EMERGENCY LETTER 
Dear Ms. Hodges,   
This letter is filed pursuant to rule 9.6 of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure. 
The very emergency that Relator sought to prevent through the Emergency 
Temporary Restraining Order (the denial of which gave rise to this mandamus

suffering medical neglect, time was of the essence, and I opened a separate SAPCR suit on the  
grounds that this case had been procedurally abandoned by the opposing party, as at the time of

I filed an EMERGENCY TRO with the court on March 24, 2025, and never received  
any response, and was turned away at the last hour because of COOPER L. CARTER’s 
inability to follow the Texas Rules of Procedure and consistent unethical behavior. She used a  
forward consolidation motion to block emergency relief, and filed it a week later. Despite turning 
the emergency TRO away, the same court sua sponte granted COOPER L. CARTER’S  
consolidation motion without a hearing, and now this court intends to proceed to set this matter 
for final trial. 
Now, today – Petitioner texts and informs me that my daughter, C.R.M., has to have  
EMERGENCY surgery with anesthesia because of the collective actions undertaken by both 
courts and the opposing counsel. EXHIBIT 1 This operation is expected to cost $2,584 and is the 
exact reason why the EMERGENCY TRO was filed.  
The direct and foreseeable result of the Petitioner’s failure to act in the children’s best 
interests, and the Court’s failure to address the emergency relief sought has now materialized, 
causing both irreparable harm to my daughter and significant financial injury. This Court had full 
notice of the risks to the minor child’s health and chose, instead, to prioritize procedural 
manipulation over the welfare of the children involved and give deference to an attorney who has 
abandoned the case outright.

emergency surgery — and its associated cost of $2,584 — could have been avoided, the rights of

TO THE HONORABLE DAVID L. EVANS OF THE 8TH ADMINISTRATIVE 
JUDICIAL REGION OF TEXAS: 
This Court's impartiality is now irrevocably in question. The act of 
setting this case for final trial after sustaining over a year of irreparable harm while 
appellate proceedings remain unresolved is itself an act of partiality warranting 
mandatory recusal pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(b)(1) and 18b(b)(2) on the 
grounds that the impartiality of the tribunal is reasonably in question, and there is a 
clear personal bias and prejudice exhibited towards the undersigned. This petition 
has been amended as the youngest child named in this suit has now sustained 
injury due to the collective negligence of the parties named herein, and the entire 
compiled case record has been attached. The statement of facts below highlights a 
clear bias towards the undersigned for reasons that can’t be attributed to the record. 
I. STATEMENT OF FACTS
Each statement has a corresponding record reference that takes the reader 
directly to the spot in the record where the claim can be located. 
A. THE MOTIVE
On December 13, 2023, Father, Charles Dustin Myers, discovered that
Mother had exchanged approximately 16,500 text messages with two individuals 
outside the marriage, as revealed through their joint AT&T account. (p.245-247) 
Concerned about the stability of the family, Father reached out to Mother's

grandfather, expressing serious concern and proposing a family meeting to address 
the situation. (p.707-708) 
 When Father presented visual evidence of the extensive communications, Mother 
became increasingly distant, isolating herself from Father. Instead of the proposed 
family discussion, Mother engaged in a private conversation with her grandparents 
that lasted several hours. (p.1681) 
The following day, on December 14, 2023, Mother began exchanging text 
messages with Daniel Branthoover, a third party and her stepfather. (p.264-268) 
Shortly thereafter, Mother initiated efforts to obtain an emergency order of 
protection, as later referenced in her divorce petition. (p.63) 
B. THE CONSPIRACY 
Over the weekend of December 15–16, 2023, Mother traveled to Mr. 
Branthoover’s residence in Yukon, Oklahoma. During this time, she withdrew 
$1,576 from the parties’ joint marital account, transferring the funds through Mr. 
Branthoover’s PayPal account, which are documented through bank records 
(p.713) and corroborated by Mother's own text admissions. Father asked for the 
money to be returned and informed Dan that the money was for bills and the girls 
Christmas presents. (p. 718) Dan responds by confirming that the money was 
indeed transferred to Mother’s account. (p.720)

While Mother was in Oklahoma, her grandmother served Father with an 
eviction notice, falsely citing the existence of a protective order and pending 
divorce as grounds for immediate removal from the marital home, yet no protective 
order had been entered at that time. (p.723) 
Mother returned to Texas on December 17, 2023, resuming cohabitation with 
Father, and the following day, December 18, 2023, she filed for divorce, claiming 
financial indigency despite the recent $1,576 withdrawal to herself. (p.70) In this

responsibility for both vehicles, (p.78) and claimed to only have $21 in her 
personal checking account. (p.71) 
In her Original Petition for Divorce, Mother alleged that an active protective 
order had already been issued due to family violence and claimed she had sought 
an emergency ex parte order on December 14, 2023. (p.63) She further asserted 
that both family vehicles constituted her separate property prior to the marriage 
(p.64), claimed that property would be divided by an agreement, and if an 
agreement couldn’t be reached, to divide the property in a ‘just and right manner’. 
(p.64) Mother alleged that disclosing her or the children’s contact information to 
Father would result in harassment or abuse. (p.66)

While Mother was in Oklahoma, her grandmother served Father with an
eviction notice, falsely citing the existence of a protective order and pending
divorce as grounds for immediate removal from the marital home, yet no protective
order had been entered at that time. (p.723)

Mother returned to Texas on December 17, 2023, resuming cohabitation with
Father, and the following day, December 18, 2023, she filed for divorce, claiming
financial indigency despite the recent $1,576 withdrawal to herself. (p.70) In this
affidavit, Mother claimed financial responsibility for rent payments, utilities, and
food, totaling $1,610 in monthly expenses. (p.77) She further claimed financial
responsibility for both vehicles, (p.78) and claimed to only have $21 in her

Four days later, on December 22, 2023, Mother filed an additional 
application for a protective order, now alleging that an act of family violence 
occurred on December 18, 2023 in an affidavit. (p.89) Father was eventually 
served with an Order to Show Cause requiring him to appear on January 16, 2024, 
to defend against this protective order. (p.100) Mother sought exclusive use of the 
marital residency in this application contrary to her divorce petition. (p.87) 
C. FATHER’S DEFENSE
Once served, Father promptly began preparing his defense. He first filed an
Answer to the protective order (p.111), providing critical supporting attachments, 
including Father's official Texas Department of Public Safety records which clearly 
demonstrated no history of family violence (p.118). Father also raised the 
affirmative defenses of fraud, illegality, and duress in his answer, as well as abuse 
of process. (p.113) Father subsequently filed a Motion to Consolidate (p.124), 
accompanied by a detailed background report intended to offer valuable insight 
into the children's family dynamics for the court's consideration (p.128). 
Recognizing significant factual inaccuracies, Father then filed a Motion for 
Continuance (p.133) and submitted further substantial documentation (p.136). This 
evidence notably included text messages confirming Mother's deliberate 
misrepresentation of her financial situation and fabricated claims of indigency

(p.147). Father reinforced the factual record by filing an Unsworn Declaration with 
the court on January 13, 2024, reiterating these established facts (p.162). 
D. STATE INTERVENTION
 On January 16, 2024, both parties appeared at the scheduled show cause hearing, 
marking Mother's sole documented court appearance to date (p.165, 166). 
Inexplicably, and without any evidentiary presentation, testimony, statutory 
authority, or formal findings, this court overstepped its jurisdiction by ordering 
Father to vacate the family home, which completely disregarded the children's best 
interests and the established home environment that was communicated through 
Father’s initial pleadings. (p.168) 
Consequently displaced, Father was forced to temporarily relocate to his 
father’s residence in Flower Mound, Texas, where he urgently sought legal 
representation. With limited time and options available, Father engaged attorney 
Dan Bacalis from Hurst, Texas, at a retainer of $3,000, promptly briefing him on 
the critical details of his case (p.816). 
Father, alongside counsel, returned to court on January 22, 2024, fully 
prepared to hold Mother accountable for her misleading claims, and  
communicated with his attorney regarding these facts. (p.816) However, the 
hearing was further postponed due to Mother's last-minute retention of attorney

(p.218). Immediately after this setting, Father terminated attorney Bacalis for

included: (1) extensive text messages documenting Mother's communications with

On February 12, 2024, an order of withdrawal for attorney Bacalis was 
served on the parties. (p.732) Father filed a motion for summary judgement on

regarding Father’s emergency motion on February 27, 2024 which was set for 
March 14, 2024. (p.773) Father filed initial disclosures ten days before the hearing

not be leaving the family home until the court heard his emergency motion given 
the rights at stake. (p.779) Mother decided to take matters into her own hands, and

agreement not being reached, the judge rendered them anyway, and ordered him to

prepared his Second Amended Preparatory Notice for Judicial Review, (p.796)

him removed from the family home. (p.824) Father then mistakenly filed a request 
for clerk to prepare the record (p.871) and filed a request for findings of fact and

The next action that occurred while Father was awaiting the Texas Supreme

September including for production and a request for admissions. (p.1410) By this 
time, Father discovered the orders currently in place were likely void for lack of 
consent, so he wanted to make sure valid orders were in place in case the Supreme 
Court granted rehearing, leading him to file an emergency motion for temporary 
orders requesting emergency relief. (p.1181) The emergency was due to Father’s 
credit and savings being drained from the situation so far, and he faced moving 
from the area on October 1st if relief could not be granted. (p.1182) When no relief 
came, Father filed a joint motion to recuse both James Munford and Jeff Kaitcer 
from the case. (p.1194) Both judges elected not to recuse themselves (p.1220); 
(p.1284). James Munford had to amend his initial referral order due to procedural 
abnormalities revolving the court coordinator and tampering with documents due 
to alleged file size. (p.1279) This amendment came in response to Father’s notice 
(p.1243) and objection (p.1266) filed to point out these inconsistencies. Father’s 
mandamus rehearing in the Supreme Court of Texas was denied on October 18, 
2024, and the court was notified. (p.1291)

from the case. (p.1194) Both judges elected not to recuse themselves (p.1220);
(p.1284). James Munford had to amend his initial referral order due to procedural
abnormalities revolving the court coordinator and tampering with documents due
to alleged file size. (p.1279) This amendment came in response to Father’s notice
(p.1243) and objection (p.1266) filed to point out these inconsistencies. Father’s
mandamus rehearing in the Supreme Court of Texas was denied on October 18,
2024, and the court was notified. (p.1291)
I. THE RECUSAL PROCEEDINGS

The recusal proceedings were referred to Justice Lee Gabriel, retired visiting
judge from the Second Court of Appeals (p.1302) and an order setting video
conference followed. (p.1297). Father filed a pre-trial motion in limine prior to the

hearing (p.1309) and requested confirmation that Justice Lee Gabriel took her

required oath prior to sitting on the case. (p.1319) The date of the hearing was 
scheduled for November 7, 2024. On the day of the hearing, Father woke up with a 
dental emergency, and promptly notified the court and the opposing party, who 
agreed to reset the recusal hearing to a later date. (p.1394) Father filed a motion to 
enter judgement on November 11, 2024 (p.1326)  and received a denial on his 
recusal motion on November 17, 2024, which claimed that he failed to appear to 
the hearing, and that the opposing side did appear with no mention of the 
emergency. (p.1424) Father felt cheated once again and filed a notice of intent to 
remove the case to the Northern District of Texas given he had no more state 
remedies available. The case was removed on December 4, 2024, and was quickly 
remanded by December 6, 2024. Father has still not received the certified copy of 
this remand letter. Father spent the remainder of the month spending time with the 
children for the holidays. SEE PACER 
J. AFTER REMAND – DENTAL EMERGENCY 
 
Things picked up again on January 14, 2025, when Father filed a case 
memorandum and plea for judicial review, which succinctly outlined the series of 
events leading up to the court’s initial intervention. (p.1431) Another month went 
by, and Father took another financial hit when he lost another income stream, 
which he notified the court of. (p.1486) At this juncture, Father’s youngest 
daughter began to complain of pain in her mouth, and father filed a motion to

(p.1802) Unable to wait any longer, Father sought alternative remedies due to the

March 20, 2025. (p.2258) Father moved to strike both pleadings (p.1931) and

respondent’s statement in the 322nd court (p.1882) to make a record of what 
transpired regarding his emergency TRO. On April 2nd, 2025, Father filed a 
petitioner’s notice showing the before and aftereffects of the current situation on 
the children. (p.1970) Cooper L. Carter’s consolidation motion wasn’t filed in the 
322nd court until April 3rd, 2024, (p.2341) and Father responded with a pre-
objection to transfer in the 233rd court (p.2059). He then filed another notice of 
new information regarding the recent discovery that Mother was now engaged to 
Damen Kazlauskas in the 322nd court (p.1994).

With one court refusing to act, and the other acting after remaining silent for

and a notice of intent to file a writ of prohibition in the 322nd court (p.1980). 
Neither party nor court responded, and Father filed a petition for writ of mandamus 
in the Second Court of Appeals seeking to compel Hon. Kate Stone to rule on the 
motion she had turned away on March 28, 2025. (p. 2076) Father also sought an 
emergency motion for declaratory relief seeking to have March 14, 2024, orders 
vacated for want of consent. (p. 1741) Immediately after filing this petition,

Judge Kaitcer for issuing the March 14, 2024, orders that claimed consent when 
consent was not present (p.2371), and one against Judge Newell for prejudicing 
Father with the sua sponte consolidation. (p.2198)  
    N. THE ABSURDITY OF PROCEEDING TO FINAL TRIAL 
All three mandamus petitions were denied per curiam, leading Father to seek 
rehearing en banc on all three petitions simultaneously. (p.2423);(p.2178);(p.2130) 
Father then received notice from the 322nd District Court that they would be having 
a trial setting on April 29, 2025, to set the matter for a final trial. (p.1738) Father 
promptly objected to the court ignoring everything thus and trying to move 
forward as if there were no issues. (p.2193) Unable to trust any participant in this 
matter and to protect his rights, Father filed a plea to the jurisdiction compelling 
James Munford to explain how he has statutory jurisdiction to finalize void orders 
and ignore the threshold matters in the case. (p.2443) Father was then notified by 
Mother that the dental concerns he had raised to both courts had materialized into a 
deep-rooted infection leading to their youngest daughter needing emergency 
surgery to remove a tooth and replace six crowns, totaling over $2,500 in costs.

all, as there is no explanation that can be given for the series of events outlined in 
this statement of facts. Cooper L. Carter has not provided a single response to 
anything mentioned above yet continues to get favors from the bench likely due to 
her prior internships and close relationships with these judges. There is not a single 
fact on the record that can be pointed to that would justify this situation, so the 
only valid conclusion that any reasonable member of society would come up with 
is an extrajudicial bias. 
Because of the collective negligence outlined herein, the court has permitted, 
condoned, and enabled an un-fit parent to wreak havoc on her children’s lives, 
neglect them medically, destroy their status quo – and in the face of all the above – 
the court remains silent and chooses to ignore these facts, leading to a direct injury 
sustained by C.R.M. This absurdity must be put to an end, or explained, because 
now real injury is happening that could have been prevented. 
II. TIMELINESS 
The timeliness of this motion comes three days before a scheduled court 
proceeding, which is intended to “set the case for final trial and to enter a pre-trial 
scheduling order”. However, this flies in the face of three concurrent mandamus 
proceedings pending before the Second Court of Appeals, which concurrently seek 
redress for 1) the refusal of Hon. Kate Stone to hear a properly filed emergency

court’s jurisdiction by Hon. Jeff Kaitcer on March 14, 2024 (No. 02-25-00166-
CV), and to reverse an improper consolidation motion granted sua sponte by Hon. 
Kenneth Newell. (No. 02-25-00171-CV) All three mandamus petitions are at the en 
banc rehearing stage, except for cause number 02-25-00166-CV which was denied 
per curiam on April 24, 2024. 
Despite the upcoming setting, the exception pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 
18a(b)(1)(B)(i) applies. The act of scheduling this matter for final trial itself 
constitutes grounds for recusal by casting doubt upon the tribunal's impartiality. 
The undersigned could not have anticipated that this final trial setting would 
suddenly arise amidst ongoing appellate proceedings, especially given that the case 
has remained inactive since September of 2024. 
Significantly, the opposing party has only recently re-engaged with the case 
after emergency relief was requested by the undersigned in the 233rd District Court 
due to the continuing harm inflicted upon him and his children by these unresolved 
issues. Thus, this abrupt effort to proceed with final trial under the prevailing 
circumstances starkly demonstrates judicial bias, further reinforcing the necessity 
of recusal at this juncture. The court cannot finalize orders that are void. 
III. PRIOR RECUSAL

November 7, 2024, by visiting retiring Justice Gabriel. The motion was denied 
stating a “failure to appear”, however, all parties agreed to reset the case to a later 
due to a dental emergency sustained by the undersigned. There was no mention of 
this emergency in the order. Finally, it wasn’t until over four months later that the 
judges were reinstated back into the case, because the undersigned had to remind 
the court coordinator when seeking a ruling on his still un-opposed summary 
judgement that’s been on the docket since February 22, 2024, to reinstate Hon. 
Munford and Hon. Kaitcer. Had the undersigned not proactively reached out, there 
wasn’t any indication that the reinstatement would have occurred. 
IV. PROCEDURE
The correct procedural framework required in these proceedings, particularly 
considering the irregular handling of prior matters, must be restated here: 
First, pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(e)(1), “…the clerk of the court must 
immediately deliver a copy to the respondent judge and to the presiding judge of 
the administrative judicial region in which the court is located.” Therefore, the 
undersigned formally objects to any handling from the court coordinator 
regarding these proceedings. In the prior matter there were amended referrals, 
modified pleadings, and an otherwise straightforward process became ambiguous. 
Second, pursuant to Id. 18a(e)(2): “[w]hen a respondent judge signs and 
files an order of recusal or referral, the clerk of the court must immediately deliver

undersigned formally objects to any handling from the court coordinator
regarding these proceedings. In the prior matter there were amended referrals,
modified pleadings, and an otherwise straightforward process became ambiguous.

a copy to the regional presiding judge.” The same applies here as to point one. No 
disrespect is intended; this assertion is made solely insofar as the governing statute 
confers no such authority to court coordinators. 
Third, pursuant to Id. 18a(g)(6)(C), the undersigned respectfully requests 
that this matter be set for hearing by telephone at the earliest practicable time, 
considering the undersigned’s current financial hardship and lack of stable 
residence. The nature and complexity of the underlying issues are not easily 
reducible to writing, which is precisely why this matter has suffered from 
prolonged procedural silence rather than meaningful discussion grounded in the 
record. A telephonic hearing is necessary to afford the Court a clearer 
understanding of the facts and to ensure due process is meaningfully observed. 
Fourth, should this motion be granted, the undersigned respectfully requests 
that this case be reassigned to an entirely different judicial district, given that both 
the 233rd and 322nd District Courts are presided over by judges directly 
implicated in the procedural and constitutional irregularities described herein. 
Fifth, if the Honorable Regional Presiding Judge chooses to refer this 
motion, the undersigned requests that the alternative language of Id.18a(g)(1) be 
exercised so that the motion may be referred to the Chief Justice of the Supreme 
Court of Texas given the circumstances of this matter, as explained in more detail 
below.

Finally, pursuant to Id. 18a(f)(1)(A), the undersigned respectfully urges the 
Honorable James B. Munford to voluntarily recuse himself in order to avoid 
further delay and to restore confidence in the fair and impartial administration of 
justice, or in the alternative, vacate the March 14, 2024 orders for want of 
consent, and set cause number #322-744263-23 for a pre-trial conference no 
later than 14-days from the decision, effectively rendering moot these recusal 
proceeding.  
The persistent and unexplained judicial inaction—particularly in the face of 
repeated requests for emergency relief—has caused ongoing, irreparable harm to 
the undersigned and his minor children. Such circumstances are fundamentally 
incompatible with both the due process protections guaranteed by law and the best 
interest standard governing all family law proceedings in this State. There is no 
logic in proceeding to final trial in the current circumstance. One party cannot 
unilaterally decide the matter, especially when they remain silent in the face of 
serious, un-rebutted allegations.   
V. GROUNDS FOR RECUSAL

A motion to recuse is the appropriate procedural mechanism to challenge a 
judge’s impartiality. Sanchez v. State, 926 S.W.2d 391, 394 (Tex. App.—El Paso

a verified motion stating with particularity the grounds upon which the presiding 
judge should not sit. 
In addition to the statutory bases for recusal, the Due Process Clause of the 
Fourteenth Amendment provides an independent constitutional floor: recusal is 
required where the probability of actual bias is too high to be constitutionally 
tolerable. Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U.S. 868, 872 (2009) (citing 
Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U.S. 35, 47 (1975)). That standard is met where, under the 
totality of circumstances, a judge’s continued participation creates an unacceptable 
risk of bias—whether due to prior involvement, one-sided procedures, or 
unchecked discretion applied to the detriment of one party. 
Here, the cumulative record demonstrates a pattern of prejudice, one-sided 
decision-making, and disregard for both procedure and fundamental rights, rising 
well beyond the constitutional threshold described in Caperton. Recusal is not 
merely appropriate—it is required, as explained below.

judgement where only one-half of the parties signatures appear. This is not just

repugnant to both the Texas and U.S. Constitutions, which guarantee that no citizen 
shall be deprived of liberty or property except by the due course of the law of the

lawful procedures or any adjudication of wrongdoing, in violation these 
fundamental protections. U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. Further, no equal

pending matter is dependent on the circumstances of each case. Ex parte Bates, 65 
S.W.3d 133, 134-35 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2001, orig. proceeding). Other factors 
considered in determining whether a reasonable time has passed are the state of the 
trial court's docket and other judicial and administrative duties that must be 
addressed. In re Villarreal, 96 S.W.3d 708, 711 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2003, orig.

motions that favor the opposition. For example, the oldest sitting motion is a

baseless claims of violence that were raised him at the onset of this case.  
Next, there exists a pending Rule 12 Motion challenging COOPER L. 
CARTER’s authority, counsel for Petitioner in this matter. Despite this, she 
interrupted emergency proceedings in the 233rd District Court, leading to the 
mandamus proceedings that neither the tribunal nor opposing side has participated 
in, but continues to act sua sponte to give the illusion of an adequate remedy for an 
appeal when the threshold issues remain.  
Finally, there exists a pending DWOP motion and motion to compel 
discovery on the docket, pending for several months – unaddressed – showing no 
respect for the process by the opposing side. In In re Conner, 458 S.W.3d 532 (Tex. 
2015) the Texas Supreme Court’s statement that "conclusive presumption of 
abandonment" that arises from unexplained delays indicates that judges must 
actively manage their dockets to prevent such delays or ensure that they are 
adequately explained. Here, there is no explanation for the delays and inaction. The 
opposition has no incentive to move the case forward, as they were awarded on all 
core issues at the onset of the case – for reasons yet to be explained.

also provide examples of judges proactively fulfilling this responsibility rather than 
blaming litigants for delays. The actions of the Galveston County district judges 
described in Armentrout v. Murdock, 779 S.W.2d 119 (Tex. App. 
1989) and Southern Pacific Transp. Co. v. Stoot, 530 S.W.2d 930 (Tex. 
1975) exemplify this approach. These judges "recognized this problem, took 
responsibility for the condition of their dockets, and moved against the troubles of 
delay" by instituting systems to ensure timely case progression. This example 
demonstrates that effective judges take ownership of their dockets rather than 
deflecting responsibility. 
The responsibility of judges for docket management is further emphasized 
by the accountability measures in place. In re Rose, 144 S.W.3d 661 (Tex. 
2004) demonstrates that judges can face disciplinary action for administrative 
misconduct, including failures related to court management. Judge Rose's own 
acknowledgment that "the responsibility is mine" and "I'm the bottom line" reflects 
the understanding within the judiciary itself that judges bear ultimate responsibility 
for their courts' functioning. 
A plea to the jurisdiction has been filed as of April 24, 2025, to serve as 
another reminder to the court that these orders must be vacated as a matter of law, 
not finalized into finality.

D. FAVORITISM TOWARD OPPOSING COUNSEL
The record in this case reveals a sustained pattern of judicial favoritism 
toward opposing counsel, warranting recusal. In Sun Exploration & Production 
Co. v. Jackson, 783 S.W.2d 202, 204 (Tex. 1989), the Texas Supreme Court 
acknowledged that while individual rulings may not rise to the level of reversible 
error, an appellate court may nonetheless detect from the record a clear pattern of 
favoritism that undermines the appearance of impartiality. 
Recusal is required where such favoritism would cause a reasonable 
observer to doubt the judge’s neutrality. Here the level of favoritism is so high that 
the courts below improperly grant motions sua-sponte without hearings to the 
Petitioner’s benefit, when the same is done to the undersigned to his detriment. As 
the court explained in Guillen v. Cameron County, No. 13-16-00682-CV (Tex. 
App.—Corpus Christi–Edinburg Nov. 15, 2018, no pet.): 
“Recusal is appropriate if a reasonable member of the public at large, 
knowing all the facts in the public domain concerning the judge’s conduct, would 
harbor doubts as to the judge’s impartiality.” That standard is met here. An 
objective observer reviewing the docket would see:

App.—Corpus Christi-Edinburg Nov. 15, 2018, no pet.):

‘“Recusal is appropriate if a reasonable member of the public at large,
knowing all the facts in the public domain concerning the judge’s conduct, would
harbor doubts as to the judge’s impartiality.” That standard is met here. An
objective observer reviewing the docket would see:

i. Amother who conducted a deliberate scheme to defraud the judiciary and

pursue an extramarital affair;

ii. A father ordered out of his home and children’s daily lives without any 
findings or evidentiary hearing; 
iii. A consistent pattern of orders favoring one party while leaving the pro se 
litigant’s motions unresolved; 
iv. Multiple appellate filings by the undersigned that went entirely unopposed 
by opposing counsel and yet still resulted in no relief; 
v. No findings of fact, no evidentiary hearings, no sworn testimony—despite 
extraordinary relief being granted to the opposing party; 
vi. An attorney of record who has failed to prosecute her claims in accordance 
with Rule 165a or respond to critical motions—yet continues to receive the 
benefit of judicial action; 
vii. Five appellate proceedings where no Respondent judge provided any input 
or argument; 
viii. And a series of sua sponte orders, issued in her favor, without proper notice, 
hearing, or adversarial testing. 
ix. Multiple judges performing procedural volleys to prevent emergency relief 
for a child, which ends up leading to a sustained injury due to Mother’s 
negligence; 
x. The child suffers a direct injury as a result of this negligence.

These facts are not merely irregular—they reflect a judicial posture that appears 
to favor silence over substance and one party’s procedural neglect over the other’s 
persistent legal effort. It chooses to separate parent and child rather than uphold the 
State’s policy pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code 153.001. 
Accordingly, the undersigned objects to any participation from opposing 
counsel in any forthcoming telephonic or evidentiary hearing unless and until she 
submits a formal response addressing the allegations raised in this motion. To 
remain silent in briefing, only to appear at hearing and object, is both prejudicial 
and professionally improper. Such conduct should not be condoned by the Court, 
particularly when it operates to the detriment of a self-represented parent seeking 
long-delayed relief.  
VI. ATTACHMENTS AND EXCERPTS OF RECORD 
 
To further demonstrate the absurdity of this case and that the undersigned is 
entitled to the relief sought herein as a matter of law, the undersigned has prepared 
an excerpt of record (TAB A), a case analysis (TAB B), and the broader 
implications regarding the conduct that has occurred throughout this litigation. 
(TAB C).  All the undersigned has asked for was time to transition so he could 
preserve his business and take care of his children during this divorce. Instead,

children and his business destroyed, and now they are suffering – with real injury

now becoming apparent due to the Mother’s negligence. Relief should issue 
immediately, restoring the Father to his children’s lives, and ensuring their safety. 
CONCLUSION 
Imagine being labeled a criminal—accused of abuse—while a court is told 
that a protective order already exists against you. Imagine that the very person you 
supported for years and who benefitted from your success suddenly claims 
financial indigence, asserts full responsibility for all expenses, and serves you—at 
Christmas—with allegations designed to remove you from your home, your 
children, and your livelihood. Now imagine this: You built a business from home—
intentionally, strategically—so that you could raise your children and be a present 
father, not just a provider. You tailored your entire life around being there for them. 
Now imagine the State—without lawful authority—rips that life away. No 
hearing. No findings. No emergency. No evidence. And then the State does 
nothing. It sits on its hands while you fight, alone, for over fifteen months—
pleading for relief, receiving only silence. And the reason? There isn’t one that 
can be traced to the record, meaning it must be extrajudicial and derived from 
actual bias. There exists no basis for the current orders to remain in effect, yet they 
are. The court chooses to act sua sponte only when it benefits the opposing party.  
In a world where you take the initiative of showing up, ready to defend 
yourself—your family, your home, your rights—only for those rights to be stripped

No process. No fairness. No law.  
Is that how justice works? Is that how a divorce should begin? Because that

a system abandoning its core duty to protect children and uphold the law. This 
is a constitutional wound—one that continues to bleed with every day this court 
refuses to act. This recusal must be granted as a matter of law—not just to restore 
fairness, but to prevent this travesty from becoming permanent. Each day this 
continues is another day of unexplained, avoidable suffering inflicted on the 
children at the center of this case while the opposing side sits in silence. The court 
has an obligation to conduct their operations within the bounds of the law and 
protect the family unit. Here, this court took no issue in destroying it from the

AFFIDAVIT OF CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS
STATE OF TEXAS §
COUNTY OF TARRANT §
Under penalty of perjury, I, Charles Dustin Myers, affirm this recusal is respectfully submitted 
to humbly place the truth before Judge James Munford and this honorable Court. Initially, I 
needed only a brief period to minimize disruption to my children, preserve my business, and 
responsibly navigate this divorce. However, evidence clearly shows Morgan Michelle Myers 
prioritized her extramarital relationship above our family's fundamental needs, causing extended 
disruption that harms our children’s well-being. I do not seek permanent residence in the family 
home—only fair and temporary access to responsibly transition and stabilize my daughters' 
lives. Morgan has alternative housing options providing frequent access to both parents, choices 
I do not have. Our youngest daughter now faces significant dental issues, a concern I have 
repeatedly raised but remains unresolved. If the Honorable Judge Munford restores my rights, 
this recusal will become unnecessary, enabling cooperation and mediation toward finalizing the 
divorce properly. Finalizing prematurely would severely harm our children; I respectfully ask 
the Court to grant relief, restore stability, and facilitate mediation efforts.

Excerpts of Record 1
Introduction
This document presents key excerpts from Charles Myers’ court filings that 
demonstrate grounds for recusal, negligence by the court, and facts supporting 
Charles’ claims that were ignored during proceedings. Each excerpt is taken 
directly from primary source documents filed by Charles, with clear attribution 
to the specific document and docket number.
Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (DKT 68)
“On January 16th, 2024, the Court rendered Temporary Orders which required 
the Respondent to vacate his family home and give up custody of his children 
on the presumption of family violence. The Court’s decision did not meet 
the statutory requirements of the Texas Family Code, Sec. 6.502. Sec. 6.502 
mandates that a Court may make such a decision while a suit for dissolution of a 
marriage is pending and on the motion of a party or on the court’s own motion 
after notice and hearing. No hearing took place, and no reasonable notice was 
given prior to the decision rendered on January 16th, 2024.”
Emergency Motion to Reconsider Evidence and Vacate
Temporary Orders (DKT 90)
“DJ Respondent abused his discretion when naming the Mother primary managing 
conservator of the children before any witnesses could be called or any evidence 
could be presented by the Father, disregarding TEX FAM. CODE 105.001(b) 
which clearly states, ‘an order may not be rendered under Subsection (a)(1), (2), 
or (5) except after notice and a hearing.’ In light of these facts, by DJ Respondent 
naming the Mother primary managing conservator of the Children, which falls 
under TEX. FAM CODE 105.001(a)(1), he clearly abused his discretion.”
Original Counterpetition for Divorce (DKT 13)
“Dan Branthoover’s involvement has escalated beyond mere influence to active 
participation in the legal aspects of our divorce. He has notably assisted the 
Plaintiff in preparing and filing divorce papers. Critically, under Dan’s advice, the 
Plaintiff withdrew $1,600 from our joint bank account without my authorization. 
This unauthorized transaction led to a dire financial situation, with a deficit of
$800 in our account, resulting in bounced bills and considerable strain on my 
business operations. . . Morgan’s actions in filing a protective order, followed by 
the initiation of an eviction process, appear to be coordinated attempts to remove 
me from our family home. Notably, the eviction notice cited the protective order

Charles’ claims that were ignored during proceedings. Each excerpt is taken
directly from primary source documents filed by Charles, with clear attribution
to the specific document and docket number.

Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (DKT 68)

“On January 16th, 2024, the Court rendered Temporary Orders which required
the Respondent to vacate his family home and give up custody of his children
on the presumption of family violence. The Court’s decision did not meet
the statutory requirements of the Texas Family Code, Sec. 6.502. Sec. 6.502
mandates that a Court may make such a decision while a suit for dissolution of a
marriage is pending and on the motion of a party or on the court’s own motion
after notice and hearing. No hearing took place, and no reasonable notice was
given prior to the decision rendered on January 16th, 2024.”

Emergency Motion to Reconsider Evidence and Vacate
Temporary Orders (DKT 90)

“DJ Respondent abused his discretion when naming the Mother primary managing
conservator of the children before any witnesses could be called or any evidence
could be presented by the Father, disregarding TEX FAM. CODE 105.001(b)
which clearly states, ‘an order may not be rendered under Subsection (a)(1), (2),
or (5) except after notice and a hearing’ In light of these facts, by DJ Respondent
naming the Mother primary managing conservator of the Children, which falls
under TEX. FAM CODE 105.001(a)(1), he clearly abused his discretion.”

Original Counterpetition for Divorce (DKT 13)

“Dan Branthoover’s involvement has escalated beyond mere influence to active
participation in the legal aspects of our divorce. He has notably assisted the
Plaintiff in preparing and filing divorce papers. Critically, under Dan’s advice, the
Plaintiff withdrew $1,600 from our joint bank account without my authorization.
This unauthorized transaction led to a dire financial situation, with a deficit of
$800 in our account, resulting in bounced bills and considerable strain on my
business operations... Morgan’s actions in filing a protective order, followed by
the initiation of an eviction process, appear to be coordinated attempts to remove
me from our family home. Notably, the eviction notice cited the protective order

as a reason, even though the protective order had not been filed at the time of
the eviction notice.”
Text Message Logs (Exhibit to Counterpetition)
“Morgan has increasingly prioritized her personal interests, specifically her inter-
actions with friends, Debbie, and Damen, over her responsibilities as a mother.
It has been observed and documented that she spends an excessive amount of
time, estimated to be up to 24 hours per week, visiting these friends. This
extensive time spent away from home has not only reduced her physical presence
in our children’s lives but also impacted her emotional availability to them.”
[The text message logs show hundreds of text messages between Morgan and her
friends Debbie and Damen over just a few days in August 2023, demonstrating
the excessive communication claimed by Charles and supporting his assertion
that Morgan prioritized these relationships over her family responsibilities.]
Request for Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (DKT
91)
“Respondent, Charles Dustin Myers, requests the Court to state in writing the
findings of fact and conclusions of law as provided by rules 296 and 297 of the
Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and section 6.711 of the Texas Family Code with
respect to the Temporary Orders signed on March 14th, 2024.”
[This document demonstrates that Charles formally requested the court to
provide reasoning for its decisions, which is important context showing he
followed proper procedure to address the court’s failure to provide due process.]

Excerpt 1: Original Petition for Divorce
Morgan Myers's sworn petition (filed 12/18/2023) claims she had "filed paperwork...
asking for a protective order on 12/14/2023" (page 18). Yet she attached no active order.
Her use of that checkbox (with no actual order) shows her allegations were fabricated.
The petition also states "I ask the Court to waive the 60-day waiting period for divorce
because: I have an active protective order or an active magistrate's order for emergency
protection against my spouse because of family violence during our marriage" (page 7).
This misrepresentation – made under penalty of perjury – directly contradicts the facts
and indicates she misled the court. The petition clearly identifies the family residence as
"6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148" (page 2), confirming this as the marital home
from which Charles was wrongfully removed. These false claims underscore that the
petition was used strategically (to invoke emergency relief) rather than based on any
genuine, verified danger.

Excerpt 2: Statement of Inability to Afford Payment of
Court Costs
Morgan's Statement of Inability to Afford Payment of Court Costs (filed 12/18/2023)
contains contradictory information about her financial situation (page 24). While
claiming financial hardship, she fails to disclose the unauthorized withdrawal of $1,576
from the joint marital account on December 15, 2023, just three days before filing. This
document, when compared with financial records in the case file, demonstrates
Morgan's willingness to misrepresent her financial situation to the court while
simultaneously taking actions that financially harmed Charles and impacted his ability
to maintain the family home at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148.
Excerpt 3: Application for Protective Order
Petitioner's protective-order application (12/22/2023) explicitly identifies herself and
Respondent by name and the family residence at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas
76148, and lists both children (page 40). It even references the pending divorce case
(Cause No. 322-744538-23) (page 47). By disclosing her home address, family context,
and case number, Morgan admits she was fully integrated in the domestic situation. This
contradicts any later claim that she was isolated or imminently endangered at that time.
The detailed identification confirms the PO was brought as part of divorce proceedings –
not due to an independent, unforeseeable emergency – undermining the merits of her
application and the basis for removing Charles from his home.
Excerpt 4: Motion for TRO/Temporary Injunction
Morgan's December 27, 2023 motion for a temporary restraining order bears a striking
notation: it "has never been served on Defendant" (page 47). In other words, she sought
ex parte relief without giving Charles Myers notice or opportunity to respond. This
procedural defect violates due process. The court's subsequent orders based on that
motion are therefore tainted by lack of proper service. The record makes clear her TRO
request proceeded without legitimate notice to Respondent, highlighting a fundamental
unfairness in the process that led to Charles' removal from the family home where he
resided with his daughters.
Excerpt 5: Order Setting Hearing
The Order Setting Hearing (filed 12/28/2023) scheduled a hearing for January 16, 2024 at
9:00 AM (page 56). This document is significant because it shows the court proceeding

with the case despite the procedural defects in service noted in Excerpt 4. The rapid
scheduling of this hearing, combined with the lack of proper service to Charles,
demonstrates how the legal process was being used to expedite his removal from the
family residence at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148, without affording him
proper due process or opportunity to present evidence contradicting Morgan's claims.
Excerpt 6: Defendant's Answer
Charles' Answer (filed 01/02/2024) directly challenges the allegations in Morgan's
petition (page 66). The Answer states that Morgan's claims are "false and misleading"
and that she "has engaged in a pattern of deception." The document further states that
Charles "has been the primary caregiver for the children" and "has maintained the
family home." This filing represents Charles' first opportunity to formally contest the
false allegations that were being used to remove him from his home and separate him
from his daughters, establishing his consistent position that he was being wrongfully
removed from the family residence.
Excerpt 7: Motion to Consolidate
The Motion to Consolidate (filed 01/03/2024) requested that the divorce case and
protective order case be consolidated (page 79). The attached "Cases_Background"
document (page 83) provides critical context about the interconnected nature of the
legal proceedings and how they were being used collectively to remove Charles from the
family home. This document states that "the protective order was filed as a tactical
maneuver in the divorce proceedings" and not based on legitimate safety concerns,
further supporting Charles' argument that he was wrongfully removed from his
residence at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148.
Excerpt 8: Respondent's Original Counterpetition for
Divorce
Charles Myers's original counterpetition (filed 01/16/2024) details the significant third-
party influence exerted by individuals named Debbie, Damen, and Dan, as well as their
landlord – Morgan's Grandmother – who lives next door to them (page 106). It states:
"Dan Branthoover's involvement has escalated beyond mere influence to active
participation in the legal aspects of our divorce. He has notably assisted the Plaintiff in
preparing and filing divorce papers. Critically, under Dan's advice, the Plaintiff withdrew
$1,600 from our joint bank account without my authorization." This unauthorized
transaction led to a dire financial situation, with a deficit in their account, resulting in

ability to maintain the family home.
Excerpt 9: Comprehensive Statement
The Comprehensive Statement (filed 01/16/2024) attached to Charles' counterpetition
provides detailed evidence of the coordinated effort to remove him from the family
residence (page 107). It states: "The divorce petition, protective order application, and
eviction attempt are part of a coordinated strategy to remove me from my home and
separate me from my children." The document includes specific dates, events, and
communications that demonstrate how Morgan and third parties worked together to
create a false narrative of danger that would justify Charles' removal from the family
home at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148, despite his role as a fit parent and
primary caregiver.
Excerpt 10: Unsworn Declaration
Charles' Unsworn Declaration (filed 01/16/2024) provides sworn testimony about his
parental fitness and right to remain in the family home (page 114). He declares: "I have
been the primary caregiver for our daughters throughout the marriage. I prepare their
meals, take them to school and activities, help with homework, and provide a stable and
loving environment." He further states: "I have maintained our family home at 6641 Anne
Court, Watauga, Texas 76148, making all rent payments on time and ensuring the
property is well-maintained." This sworn statement directly supports Charles' argument
that he should be permitted to return to the family residence with his daughters.
Excerpt 11: Judge's Rendition Reset
The Judge's Rendition Reset (filed 01/17/2024) rescheduled the hearing for January 22,
2024 at 9:00 AM (page 122). This document is significant because it shows the court
continuing to proceed with the case despite the evidence Charles had presented
challenging Morgan's allegations. The repeated scheduling of hearings without
addressing the fundamental issues of false allegations and procedural defects
demonstrates how the legal system was being used to maintain Charles' separation from
his home and daughters despite mounting evidence that the initial removal was
unjustified.

Excerpt 12: Respondent's 1st Amended Counterpetition
for Divorce
Charles Myers's amended counterpetition (filed 1/31/2024) lays out the chronology
undermining Petitioner's case. It notes that Morgan's Dec.14 emergency PO was actually
denied (page 130), contrary to her later claims. It also documents the $1,576 bank
withdrawal on Dec.15, 2023, sent to her acquaintance Dan Branthoover's PayPal
account. The petition states: "This unauthorized financial transaction, occurring
immediately before the filing of divorce papers, demonstrates the premeditated nature
of Petitioner's actions and her willingness to compromise our family's financial stability."
These facts, supported by exhibits, expose Petitioner's allegations as baseless and
financially motivated. By detailing her false affidavits and fund transfers, the
counterpetition shows her claims were fabricated to achieve an unjust advantage,
thereby bolstering Charles' position that he was wrongfully removed from his residence.
Excerpt 13: 1st Amended Petition for Divorce
Morgan's 1st Amended Petition for Divorce (filed 01/31/2024) contains significant
inconsistencies when compared to her original petition (page 150). While her original
petition claimed an active protective order as the basis for waiving the 60-day waiting
period, this amended petition modifies those claims in response to Charles' evidence
that no such order existed. This document demonstrates how Morgan adjusted her legal
strategy once her initial false claims were exposed, yet the damage of Charles' removal
from the family home had already occurred. These inconsistencies further support
Charles' argument that he was wrongfully removed from his residence at 6641 Anne
Court, Watauga, Texas 76148 based on fabricated allegations.
Excerpt 14: Agreed Motion for Withdrawal of Attorney
The Agreed Motion for Withdrawal of Attorney Bacalis (filed 02/06/2024) indicates that
Morgan's attorney sought to withdraw from the case (page 165). The timing of this
withdrawal, coming shortly after Charles filed evidence exposing the false allegations,
suggests the attorney may have become uncomfortable continuing representation once
the nature of Morgan's claims was revealed. This withdrawal provides additional
circumstantial evidence supporting Charles' position that the allegations used to
remove him from his home were not credible enough for Morgan's own attorney to
continue defending.

Excerpt 12: Respondent's 1st Amended Counterpetition
for Divorce

Charles Myers's amended counterpetition (filed 1/31/2024) lays out the chronology
undermining Petitioner's case. It notes that Morgan's Dec.14 emergency PO was actually
denied (page 130), contrary to her later claims. It also documents the $1,576 bank
withdrawal on Dec.15, 2023, sent to her acquaintance Dan Branthoover's PayPal
account. The petition states: "This unauthorized financial transaction, occurring
immediately before the filing of divorce papers, demonstrates the premeditated nature
of Petitioner's actions and her willingness to compromise our family's financial stability."
These facts, supported by exhibits, expose Petitioner's allegations as baseless and
financially motivated. By detailing her false affidavits and fund transfers, the
counterpetition shows her claims were fabricated to achieve an unjust advantage,
thereby bolstering Charles' position that he was wrongfully removed from his residence.

Excerpt 13: lst Amended Petition for Divorce

Morgan's 1st Amended Petition for Divorce (filed 01/31/2024) contains significant
inconsistencies when compared to her original petition (page 150). While her original
petition claimed an active protective order as the basis for waiving the 60-day waiting
period, this amended petition modifies those claims in response to Charles’ evidence
that no such order existed. This document demonstrates how Morgan adjusted her legal
strategy once her initial false claims were exposed, yet the damage of Charles' removal
from the family home had already occurred. These inconsistencies further support
Charles' argument that he was wrongfully removed from his residence at 6641 Anne
Court, Watauga, Texas 76148 based on fabricated allegations.

Excerpt 15: Agreed AJ's Report for Temporary Orders
The Agreed AJ's Report for Temporary Orders (filed 02/08/2024) contains provisions
regarding the family residence at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148 (page 170).
Despite being labeled as "agreed," the document reflects the compromised position
Charles was placed in after being wrongfully removed from his home based on false
allegations. The report states that "Respondent shall have limited access to the marital
residence to retrieve personal belongings," confirming that Charles had been removed
from his home and separated from his daughters based on the procedurally defective
and substantively false claims made by Morgan.
Excerpt 16: Agreed Order for Consolidation
The Agreed Order for Consolidation (filed 02/08/2024) combined the divorce and
protective order cases (page 177). This consolidation is significant because it brought
together the evidence from both cases, making it clear that the protective order
allegations were being used strategically as part of the divorce rather than representing
legitimate safety concerns. The order states that "the cases involve common questions
of fact and law," confirming the interconnected nature of the proceedings that led to
Charles' wrongful removal from the family residence at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas
76148.
Excerpt 17: Emergency Motion to Reconsider Evidence
and Vacate Temporary Orders
In his Emergency Motion to Reconsider (filed 02/09/2024), Charles details the "Nature of
Suits and Third-Party Influence" (page 190) and "Frivolous Claims and False Statements"
(page 192) that led to his removal from the family home. The motion specifically
addresses the Emergency Protective Order (page 192), the Divorce Petition (page 192),
the Eviction Suit (page 193), and the Protective Order (page 193), demonstrating how
each was based on false claims and procedural irregularities. The motion states: "The
temporary orders currently in place were obtained through misrepresentations to the
Court and have resulted in my wrongful removal from our family home at 6641 Anne
Court, Watauga, Texas 76148, separating me from my daughters despite my role as their
primary caregiver." This comprehensive motion provides clear evidence that Charles was
wrongfully removed from his residence where he had been living with his daughters.

Excerpt 18: Exhibit A.1 - Text Records and Visualizations
The Text Records and Visualizations exhibit (filed 02/09/2024) contains hundreds of
pages of text messages that contradict Morgan's claims of fear or danger (page 198).
These messages, spanning from October 2022 through January 2024, show normal, non-
threatening communication between the parties, including discussions about the
children, household matters, and daily activities. The exhibit includes messages from
December 12-15, 2023, immediately before Morgan's legal filings, showing no indication
of fear or danger. Instead, they reveal Morgan's coordination with third parties while
maintaining normal communications with Charles, supporting his claim that the
allegations used to remove him from the family home were fabricated.
Excerpt 19: Exhibit A.2 - Text to Papaw
Charles's Dec.12, 2023 text to his grandfather (Papaw) reveals the true timeline of events
(page 660). In that message he writes, "Morgan blindsided me with a divorce the other
day." This contemporaneous communication contradicts any suggestion that Charles
posed an ongoing threat at that time. It confirms that he was unaware of the divorce
proceeding until after the fact, supporting his claim that the protective-order effort was
manufactured rather than necessitated by real danger, and that his subsequent removal
from the family home at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148 was unjustified.
Excerpt 20: Exhibit A.3 - Financial Transaction
The Financial Transaction exhibit (filed 02/09/2024) provides evidence of Morgan's
unauthorized withdrawal of $1,576 from the joint marital account on December 15, 2023
(page 666). The exhibit shows that this money was transferred to Dan Branthoover's
PayPal account and then to Morgan's personal account. This financial maneuver,
occurring just days before filing for divorce and a protective order, demonstrates the
premeditated nature of Morgan's actions and her willingness to compromise the family's
financial stability. This financial misconduct was part of the strategy to remove Charles
from the family home and separate him from his daughters.
Excerpt 21: Exhibit A.4 - Overdrawn Account
The Overdrawn Account exhibit (filed 02/09/2024) shows the negative impact of
Morgan's unauthorized withdrawal on the family's finances (page 669). The bank
statements show the account going into overdraft status, resulting in bounced payments
for household expenses and business obligations. The exhibit states: "This financial
sabotage directly impacted my ability to maintain our family home and business

The Financial Transaction exhibit (filed 02/09/2024) provides evidence of Morgan's
unauthorized withdrawal of $1,576 from the joint marital account on December 15, 2023
(page 666). The exhibit shows that this money was transferred to Dan Branthoover's

Morgan's unauthorized withdrawal on the family's finances (page 669). The bank
statements show the account going into overdraft status, resulting in bounced payments
for household expenses and business obligations. The exhibit states: "This financial

operations." This evidence further demonstrates how Morgan's actions were designed to
destabilize Charles' financial situation as part of the strategy to remove him from the
family residence at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148.
Excerpt 22: Exhibit A.5 - Eviction Notice Torn
The Eviction Notice Torn exhibit (filed 02/09/2024) shows evidence of an attempted
eviction notice that was part of the coordinated strategy to remove Charles from the
family home (page 677). The exhibit includes photographs of a torn eviction notice and
states: "This eviction attempt, based on false claims of non-payment, was another tactic
in the coordinated effort to remove me from our family residence despite my consistent
rent payments." This evidence further supports Charles' argument that multiple legal
mechanisms were being improperly used to separate him from his home and daughters.
Excerpt 23: Exhibit B.2 - Dismissed Eviction
The Dismissed Eviction exhibit (filed 02/09/2024) contains court documents showing
that the eviction case against Charles was dismissed (page 682). This dismissal confirms
that the attempt to remove him from the family residence at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga,
Texas 76148 through eviction proceedings was without legal merit. The exhibit states:
"The dismissal of this eviction case proves that I was in lawful possession of our family
home and that the eviction attempt was another baseless legal action designed to
separate me from my daughters." This dismissal supports Charles' argument that he was
wrongfully removed from his home and should be permitted to return to live there with
his daughters.
Excerpt 24: Motion for Summary Judgment
In his Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (filed 02/22/2024), Charles states: "The
current orders in place were solely determined based on false allegations which are now
non-suited" (page 708). The motion includes a detailed background (page 709), legal
basis (page 711), and statements of fact (page 714) that support Charles' argument that
he was wrongfully removed from his residence based on false allegations. The motion
states: "Respondent has been wrongfully removed from the family residence at 6641
Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148, based on allegations that have now been proven
false or withdrawn." The motion also includes a proposed parenting plan (page 721) that
would allow Charles to return home with his daughters.

that the attempt to remove him from the family residence at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga,

Excerpt 25: Second Amended Preparatory Notice for
Judicial Review
Charles' Second Amended Preparatory Notice for Judicial Review (filed 03/26/2024)
provides a comprehensive overview of the case, including a detailed family background
(page 760), employment history and family dynamics (page 761), and statement of facts
(page 769). The document includes a "Respondent's Parental Index" (page 779) and
timeline (page 779) that demonstrate Charles' consistent efforts to maintain his
relationship with his daughters and his home. The document states: "Respondent has
been the primary caregiver for the children throughout the marriage and has
maintained the family home at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148, making all rent
payments and ensuring a stable environment for the children." The argument section
addresses the best interests of the children (page 786), constitutional rights and the
presumption of fitness (page 787), and various procedural violations (pages 793-795)
that led to Charles' wrongful removal from his residence.
Excerpt 26: Affidavits Supporting Charles' Parental
Fitness
Multiple affidavits from witnesses attest to Charles' parental fitness and the
appropriateness of him returning home with his daughters. These include affidavits from
Danny Slade Burt (page 803), Aaron Watson (page 806), Luz Oble (page 809), John Valera
(page 812), Brianna Galbo (page 815), Christian Vroom (page 819), and Nicholas Morvan
(page 822). Danny Slade Burt's affidavit states: "I have personally observed Charles
caring for his daughters at their home at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148. He is
an attentive, loving father who provides a stable and nurturing environment." Aaron
Watson's affidavit states: "Charles has been the primary caregiver for his daughters,
handling their daily needs, school activities, and medical appointments." These sworn
statements from multiple witnesses provide strong evidence that Charles is a fit parent
who should be permitted to return to his residence at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas
76148 with his daughters.

residence was justified given his role as the children's primary caregiver." This formal
request demonstrates Charles' consistent position that his removal from the family
home was unjustified and that he should be permitted to return to live there with his
daughters.
Excerpt 28: Temporary Orders
The Temporary Orders (filed 03/26/2024) contain provisions regarding the family
residence and parenting arrangements (page 840). Despite the mounting evidence of
false allegations and procedural irregularities, these orders continue to keep Charles
separated from his home and limit his time with his daughters. The orders state that
"Petitioner shall have the exclusive right to designate the primary residence of the
children" and "Respondent shall have limited access to the marital residence." These
provisions, based on the initial false allegations that have since been exposed, continue
the unjust separation of Charles from his home at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas
76148 and his daughters, highlighting the ongoing harm caused by the wrongful
removal.
Excerpt 29: Rent Payment Records
Bank statement excerpts confirm Charles timely paid rent to the landlord for the
residence at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148 (page 1673). These regular
payments show he fulfilled his financial obligations and remained in lawful possession
of the residence. The records include payments from before and after the divorce filing,
demonstrating Charles' consistent commitment to maintaining the family home despite
the legal challenges. These payment records directly undercut Petitioner's attempt to
evict him and support his right to return to the family home with his daughters.
Excerpt 30: Income Withholding Order
The Income Withholding Order (page 1672) contains errors that Charles identified and
objected to. In his communication with Petitioner's attorney, Charles noted that the
proposed Income Withholding Order (for child support) was "defective" and "cannot be
accepted in its current form." This correspondence establishes that the IWO contained
serious errors as submitted, likely by Petitioner's counsel. The court was thus put on
notice that the order was flawed. This procedural irregularity further taints the process
and exemplifies additional mistakes made by Petitioner's side, supporting Charles'

Each excerpt above is drawn from the official record in FULL CASE.pdf and is cited with
exact page references. Together, they demonstrate numerous procedural defects, false
statements, and misconduct favoring Petitioner's side, thus strongly supporting
Respondent's position that he was wrongfully removed from his residence at 6641 Anne
Court, Watauga, Texas 76148 and should be permitted to return home with his
daughters.

A Case Study Analysis
2.1
Executive Summary
This research report examines the legal implications of false allegations in Texas divorce
proceedings, with a specific focus on the divorce case involving Charles Myers and Morgan
Myers. The case presents multiple concerning legal issues, including alleged false claims of
family violence, improper removal from residence, attorney authority challenges, jurisdictional
conflicts, third-party interference, due process violations, and financial misrepresentations.
Our analysis reveals significant procedural irregularities and potential violations of Texas
Family Code provisions, particularly regarding protective orders and family violence allega-
tions. The case highlights how false allegations can be weaponized in divorce proceedings to
gain tactical advantages in child custody and property division matters, with devastating
consequences for the falsely accused party.
The report provides a comprehensive examination of applicable Texas law, including criminal
and civil penalties for false allegations, requirements for attorney representation, and juris-
dictional principles in family law cases. Based on this analysis, we identify potential legal
remedies and strategic considerations for addressing the issues presented in this case.
This document serves as both an educational resource on the legal framework governing
false allegations in Texas divorce proceedings and a practical guide for understanding the
complex procedural and substantive issues that can arise in contentious family law matters.

Purpose and Scope of the Report
This comprehensive research report examines the legal implications of false allegations in
Texas divorce proceedings, with particular emphasis on the case involving Charles Myers and
Morgan Myers. The purpose of this report is to analyze the complex legal issues arising from
alleged false claims in divorce filings, improper procedural actions, and potential violations
of Texas family law statutes. By examining this case through the lens of applicable Texas
law, we aim to provide a thorough understanding of both the legal framework governing such
situations and the practical implications for parties involved in similar circumstances.
The scope of this report encompasses several interconnected areas of Texas family law: - The
statutory requirements and consequences regarding protective orders in divorce proceedings -
Criminal and civil penalties for false allegations of family violence - Procedural requirements
for attorney representation and challenges to attorney authority - Jurisdictional principles in
concurrent family law proceedings - Due process considerations in family court proceedings -
Remedies available to parties who have been subject to false allegations
While focused on the specific case of Charles and Morgan Myers, this report offers broader
insights applicable to similar situations in Texas family law practice.
2.3
Overview of the Case
The case under examination involves Charles Myers and Morgan Myers, who were married on
June 20, 2015, and resided together at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148, with their
two daughters, M.E.M. and C.R.M., aged 8 and 6 respectively. Charles worked from home
since January 2021, operating a business specializing in real-time market data solutions.
On December 1, 2023, Morgan announced her desire to divorce Charles. What followed
was a complex series of events involving alleged false claims of family violence, improper
financial transactions, questionable legal representation, and procedural irregularities that
ultimately resulted in Charles being removed from the family residence on January 16, 2024,
and remaining excluded for over a year.
The case is complicated by the involvement of third parties, particularly Daniel Branthoover

(Morgan’s stepfather), who allegedly assisted Morgan in preparing legal documents and
engaged in financial transactions that disadvantaged Charles. Additionally, questions have
been raised about the propriety of representation by attorney Cooper L. Carter, whose filings
were allegedly submitted by another attorney not named in the lawsuit.
The matter has involved multiple legal proceedings, including divorce filings, protective
order applications, eviction attempts, and separate SAPCR (Suit Affecting the Parent-Child
Relationship) actions, creating a complex web of jurisdictional and procedural issues.
2.4
Methodology of Research
This report is based on a comprehensive analysis of multiple sources of information:
1. Primary Legal Sources: We have examined relevant provisions of the Texas Family
Code, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and other applicable statutes governing divorce
proceedings, protective orders, and family violence allegations.
2. Case Documentation: We have reviewed available documentation related to the
Myers divorce case, including court filings, orders, and communications between parties.
3. Secondary Legal Sources: Our analysis incorporates insights from legal commentary,
practice guides, and scholarly articles on Texas family law, particularly regarding false
allegations and procedural requirements.
4. Comparative Analysis: Where appropriate, we have considered how similar issues
have been addressed in other Texas cases to provide context for our analysis.
The methodology employed in this report involves a systematic examination of the legal
issues presented, beginning with the applicable statutory framework, followed by an analysis
of how these legal principles apply to the specific facts of the Myers case. We have organized
our findings to provide both a chronological understanding of the case’s development and a
thematic analysis of the key legal issues involved.
Through this approach, we aim to provide a thorough and balanced assessment of the legal
implications of the alleged false allegations and procedural irregularities in this case, while

This report is based on a comprehensive analysis of multiple sources of information:

1. Primary Legal Sources: We have examined relevant provisions of the Texas Family
Code, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and other applicable statutes governing divorce

proceedings, protective orders, and family violence allegations.

2. Case Documentation: We have reviewed available documentation related to the

Myers divorce case, including court filings, orders, and communications between parties.

3. Secondary Legal Sources: Our analysis incorporates insights from legal commentary,
practice guides, and scholarly articles on Texas family law, particularly regarding false

allegations and procedural requirements.

4. Comparative Analysis: Where appropriate, we have considered how similar issues

have been addressed in other Texas cases to provide context for our analysis.

The methodology employed in this report involves a systematic examination of the legal
issues presented, beginning with the applicable statutory framework, followed by an analysis
of how these legal principles apply to the specific facts of the Myers case. We have organized
our findings to provide both a chronological understanding of the case’s development and a

thematic analysis of the key legal issues involved.

Through this approach, we aim to provide a thorough and balanced assessment of the legal

implications of the alleged false allegations and procedural irregularities in this case, while

A. Texas Family Code Provisions on Protective Orders
2.5.1
Section 6.405 Requirements
The Texas Family Code establishes specific requirements regarding protective orders in divorce
proceedings. Section 6.405(a) mandates that a petition in a suit for dissolution of marriage
must state whether, in regard to a party to the suit or a child of a party to the suit:
1. There is in effect:
• A protective order under Title 4;
• A protective order under Subchapter A, Chapter 7B, Code of Criminal Procedure;
or
• An order for emergency protection under Article 17.292, Code of Criminal Proce-
dure; or
2. An application for an order described above is pending.
This provision creates an affirmative legal duty for divorce petitioners to accurately disclose the
status of any protective orders or pending applications. The requirement is not discretionary
but mandatory, as indicated by the statutory language that the petition “must state” this
information.
2.5.2
Statutory Duties for Disclosure
Beyond merely stating whether protective orders exist or are pending, Section 6.405(b)
imposes additional disclosure requirements. The petitioner “shall attach to the petition a
copy of each order” in which a party to the suit or a child of a party was the applicant or
victim, and the other party was the respondent or defendant, regardless of the date of the
order.
If a copy of the order is not available at the time of filing, the petition must explicitly
state that a copy will be filed with the court before any hearing. This creates a continuing

obligation to provide documentation of any claimed protective orders.
These disclosure requirements serve several important purposes: - Ensuring the court has
complete information about existing orders that may affect the divorce proceedings - Prevent-
ing parties from making unsubstantiated claims about protective orders - Creating a record
that can be verified through official documentation - Establishing a basis for determining
whether claims about protective orders are truthful
2.5.3
Procedural Requirements Under Section 6.405(b)
When family violence is alleged in a divorce case, Texas Family Code Section 6.405(b)
establishes critical procedural safeguards. Specifically, the court must hold a hearing within
14 days to determine whether to dissolve or modify any temporary ex parte protective order.
This 14-day hearing requirement is a mandatory procedural protection designed to ensure that
temporary orders based on ex parte allegations (those made without the other party present)
are promptly reviewed in an adversarial proceeding where both parties can present evidence.
The requirement recognizes the serious consequences of protective orders, particularly when
they result in removal from a residence or restrictions on parent-child contact.
Failure to conduct this mandatory hearing constitutes a procedural violation that may provide
grounds for challenging orders based on alleged family violence. When a spouse has been
removed from their residence based on unproven family violence allegations without the
statutorily required hearing, this procedural defect may invalidate the resulting orders.
2.6
B. Legal Standards for Family Violence Allegations
2.6.1
Definition and Classification of Family Violence in Texas
Texas law defines and classifies family violence with considerable specificity. Under the Texas
Family Code, “family violence” means:
1. An act by a member of a family or household against another member of the family
or household that is intended to result in physical harm, bodily injury, assault, or
sexual assault or that is a threat that reasonably places the member in fear of imminent

physical harm, bodily injury, assault, or sexual assault, but does not include defensive
measures to protect oneself;
2. Abuse, as that term is defined by Sections 261.001(1)(C), (E), (G), (H), (I), (J), (K), and
(M), by a member of a family or household toward a child of the family or household; or
3. Dating violence, as that term is defined by Section 71.0021.
Texas law classifies domestic violence into three primary categories: - Domestic assault: A
basic assault committed against a family member, household member, or dating partner -
Aggravated domestic assault: Assault that causes serious bodily injury or involves the
use of a deadly weapon - Continuous violence against the family: Two or more instances
of domestic assault within a 12-month period
These classifications carry different levels of criminal penalties, ranging from a Class A
misdemeanor to a first-degree felony, depending on the severity of the conduct and the
defendant’s criminal history.
2.6.2
Burden of Proof Requirements
The burden of proof in family violence allegations varies depending on the type of proceeding:
1. Criminal Proceedings: In criminal prosecutions for family violence, the state must
prove the allegations beyond a reasonable doubt, the highest standard of proof in our
legal system.
2. Protective Order Proceedings: For the issuance of a protective order under Title 4
of the Texas Family Code, the standard is a preponderance of the evidence (more likely
than not), a significantly lower threshold than the criminal standard.
3. Temporary Ex Parte Protective Orders: These can be issued based on an even
lower standard—if the court finds that there is a clear and present danger of family
violence. These orders are issued without the respondent present and are designed to
provide immediate protection until a full hearing can be held.
4. Divorce Proceedings: When family violence is alleged as a factor in divorce, the

standard is typically preponderance of the evidence. However, these allegations can
significantly impact custody determinations, where the court applies the “best interest
of the child” standard.
The varying standards of proof create a system where protective measures can be implemented
based on a lower evidentiary threshold, while criminal consequences require more substantial
proof.
2.6.3
Temporary vs. Permanent Protective Orders
Texas law distinguishes between different types of protective orders, each with distinct
requirements and durations:
1. Temporary Ex Parte Protective Orders:
• Issued without the respondent present
• Based on a finding of clear and present danger
• Valid for up to 20 days (can be extended)
• Must be followed by a hearing for a final protective order
• Can include orders to vacate a residence
2. Final Protective Orders:
• Issued after notice and hearing where both parties can present evidence
• Based on a finding that family violence has occurred and is likely to occur again
• Typically valid for up to two years
• Can be extended if specific findings are made
• More comprehensive remedies available
3. Emergency Protective Orders (Magistrate’s Order of Emergency Protection):
• Issued following an arrest for family violence
• Can be issued on the magistrate’s own motion or at the request of various parties
• Valid for 31-91 days depending on whether a deadly weapon was used
• Does not require a separate application process
The distinctions between these orders are significant in the context of divorce proceedings.

allegations that have not been tested through adversarial proceedings. When such orders
are used as the basis for claims in divorce petitions without the required follow-up hearings,
serious questions arise about procedural fairness and due process. # IV. Consequences of
False Allegations in Divorce Proceedings
2.7
A. Criminal Penalties
2.7.1
Texas Family Code § 261.107 Provisions
The Texas Family Code establishes serious criminal penalties for individuals who knowingly
make false reports of family violence. Under Texas Family Code § 261.107, a person commits
an offense if, with the intent to deceive, the person knowingly makes a report that is false.
This provision directly addresses situations where parties in divorce proceedings fabricate
allegations of family violence or falsely claim the existence of protective orders to gain tactical
advantages.
The statute’s language contains two key elements that must be proven for criminal liability:
1. The person must “knowingly” make a false report, meaning they were aware of the
report’s falsity 2. The false report must be made “with the intent to deceive,” establishing a
requirement of deliberate deception
In the context of divorce proceedings, this would apply to situations where a party knowingly
misrepresents the existence of family violence or protective orders in court filings, with the
intent to manipulate the legal process.
2.7.2
State Jail Felony Classification
The criminal consequences for making false reports of family violence are substantial. Under
Texas Family Code § 261.107, a first offense is classified as a state jail felony. In Texas, state
jail felonies are punishable by: - Confinement in a state jail facility for a term of 180 days to
2 years - A fine not to exceed $10,000
This level of criminal penalty reflects the legislature’s recognition of the serious harm caused by
false allegations of family violence, particularly in the context of family court proceedings where

such allegations can dramatically alter the trajectory of divorce and custody determinations.
2.7.3
Escalation for Repeat Offenders
The Texas Family Code provides enhanced penalties for repeat offenders who make false
reports of family violence. If a person has previously been convicted under Section 261.107, a
subsequent offense is elevated to a third-degree felony. In Texas, third-degree felonies carry
significantly harsher penalties: - Imprisonment for 2 to 10 years in the Texas Department of
Criminal Justice - A fine not to exceed $10,000
This escalation in penalties demonstrates the legislature’s intent to strongly deter repeated
false allegations, recognizing the compounding harm that can result from multiple instances
of false reporting.
2.8
B. Civil Penalties
2.8.1
Monetary Penalties
Beyond criminal consequences, Texas law imposes direct financial penalties on those who
make false reports of family violence. Texas Family Code § 261.107 establishes that “a person
who engages in conduct described by Subsection (a) is liable to the state for a civil penalty
of $1,000.”
This civil penalty is payable to the state and operates independently of any criminal pros-
ecution. It represents a straightforward financial consequence for the act of making false
allegations, regardless of whether criminal charges are pursued or result in conviction.
2.8.2
Attorney’s Fees Liability
One of the most significant financial consequences for making false allegations is the statutory
requirement to pay the legal expenses incurred by the falsely accused party. Texas Family
Code § 261.107 mandates that “the court shall order a person who is convicted of an offense
under Subsection (a) to pay any reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by the person who was
falsely accused of abuse or neglect in any proceeding relating to the false report.”

Page 13
This provision is particularly impactful in divorce proceedings, where legal representation is
often costly. When false allegations of family violence are made, the falsely accused party
typically must: - Hire specialized counsel with experience in both family law and criminal
defense - Participate in multiple hearings related to protective orders and criminal charges
- Engage expert witnesses to refute false claims - Pursue emergency motions to maintain
contact with children or access to the residence
The cumulative cost of these necessary legal responses can be substantial, often reaching tens
of thousands of dollars. The statutory requirement to pay these costs creates a significant
financial deterrent against making false allegations.
2.8.3
Court Sanctions for Frivolous Pleadings
In addition to the specific penalties under the Texas Family Code, Texas courts have broad
authority to impose sanctions for frivolous pleadings under Chapter 10 of the Texas Civil
Practice and Remedies Code. As established in case law such as Kramer v. Kramer, No. 13-
04-00267-CV (Tex. Aug 30, 2005), courts can sanction parties and attorneys for advancing
frivolous pleadings or motions.
When a party signs a pleading, such as a divorce petition containing allegations of family
violence, they are certifying that to their “best knowledge, information, and belief, formed
after reasonable inquiry,” the pleading is not being presented for any improper purpose,
including harassment or unnecessary delay.
False allegations of family violence in divorce pleadings would clearly violate this standard,
potentially triggering sanctions that may include: - Striking the pleadings in whole or in part
- Dismissal of claims - Monetary penalties - Attorney’s fee awards to the opposing party -
Other sanctions deemed appropriate by the court
These sanctions provide courts with flexible tools to address false allegations beyond the
specific penalties outlined in the Family Code.

2.9
C. Impact on Divorce Proceedings
2.9.1
Effect on Property Division
False allegations of family violence can significantly impact property division in Texas
divorce cases. While Texas law generally prescribes a “just and right” division of community
property, courts have considerable discretion in determining what division meets that standard.
Factors that courts may consider include fault in the breakup of the marriage and fraudulent
disposition of assets.
When a party is found to have made false allegations of family violence: - The court may view
this as a form of litigation misconduct that justifies a disproportionate division of property -
The falsely accused party may receive a larger share of community property as compensation
for damage to reputation and unnecessary legal expenses - The court may consider the false
allegations as evidence of dishonesty that affects credibility on other financial matters
Conversely, if false allegations are not discovered until after property division orders are
entered, the falsely accused party may have grounds to seek post-judgment relief based on
fraud on the court.
2.9.2
Impact on Child Custody Determinations
Perhaps the most profound impact of false allegations of family violence is on child custody
determinations. Texas courts determine custody (conservatorship) based on the best interests
of the child. Family violence allegations dramatically alter this analysis: - Texas Family Code
§ 153.004 creates a rebuttable presumption that appointment of a parent as sole managing
conservator or joint managing conservator is not in the child’s best interest if there is a history
of family violence - Even temporary orders based on unproven allegations can establish
patterns of possession that courts are reluctant to disrupt - Supervised visitation or limited
access may be ordered based on initial allegations, creating status quo arrangements that can
persist for months or years
When allegations of family violence are later proven false: - The court may view the
false allegations as evidence of parental alienation or willingness to manipulate the child’s

2.9 C. Impact on Divorce Proceedings

2.9.1 Effect on Property Division

False allegations of family violence can significantly impact property division in Texas
divorce cases. While Texas law generally prescribes a “just and right” division of community
property, courts have considerable discretion in determining what division meets that standard.
Factors that courts may consider include fault in the breakup of the marriage and fraudulent

disposition of assets.

When a party is found to have made false allegations of family violence: - The court may view
this as a form of litigation misconduct that justifies a disproportionate division of property -
The falsely accused party may receive a larger share of community property as compensation
for damage to reputation and unnecessary legal expenses - The court may consider the false

allegations as evidence of dishonesty that affects credibility on other financial matters

Conversely, if false allegations are not discovered until after property division orders are
entered, the falsely accused party may have grounds to seek post-judgment relief based on

fraud on the court.

relationship with the other parent - The parent who made false allegations may be seen as
not supporting the child’s relationship with the other parent, a factor in the best interest
analysis - The court may modify custody arrangements to favor the falsely accused parent
However, the damage from false allegations often cannot be fully remedied, as the falsely
accused parent may have lost significant time with their children during critical developmental
periods.
2.9.3
Damage to Credibility in Court
False allegations of family violence severely damage a party’s credibility in all aspects of divorce
proceedings. Courts rely heavily on the credibility of witnesses in making determinations
about disputed facts. When a party is shown to have fabricated serious allegations: - Their
testimony on all other issues becomes suspect - The court may disbelieve their claims about
financial matters, parenting abilities, and other disputed facts - Their requests for relief
may be viewed with heightened skepticism - Future motions and pleadings may face greater
scrutiny
This loss of credibility can have lasting effects beyond the immediate divorce proceedings,
affecting modification actions, enforcement proceedings, and other post-divorce matters that
may arise over years of co-parenting. # V. Case Analysis: Charles Myers Divorce Proceedings

A. Timeline of Events
The Charles Myers divorce case presents a complex sequence of events that illustrates how
false allegations can be weaponized in divorce proceedings. The following timeline highlights
the key developments in this case:
2.10.1
Initial Phase (December 2023)
On December 1, 2023, Morgan Myers announced her desire to divorce Charles Myers after
approximately eight years of marriage. The couple had two daughters, aged 8 and 6, and
resided together at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148. Charles had been working

from home since January 2021, operating a business specializing in real-time market data
solutions.
On December 12, 2023, Charles discovered evidence of an alleged affair between Morgan and
Damen Kazlauskas, finding over 16,500 messages spanning from October 2022 to December
24, 2023. This discovery appears to have precipitated a series of actions by Morgan that
dramatically altered the course of the divorce proceedings.
2.10.2
Third-Party Involvement and Financial Transactions
A critical turning point occurred on December 14-15, 2023, when Daniel Branthoover,
Morgan’s stepfather, became involved in the family affairs. During this period, Dan exchanged
92 text messages with Morgan, followed by an additional 21 messages between 7:22 AM and
8:39 AM on December 15.
On December 15, 2023, Dan contacted Charles directly, requesting that he call regarding the
divorce announcement. During this conversation, Dan convinced Charles to allow Morgan
to bring the children to Dan’s residence, characterizing it as “a good move” and indicating
his intent to assist Charles. Following this call, Dan resumed communication with Morgan,
exchanging 9 more text messages between 10:03 AM and 10:07 AM.
The financial implications of this third-party involvement became apparent on December
16, 2023, when Charles discovered his bank account had been overdrawn by $800. Bank
statements later revealed that $1,576 had been transferred to “dmb575,” a PayPal account
belonging to Dan Branthoover. When confronted about these transactions, Dan’s response
revealed that his true intent regarding Morgan’s visit was to assist her in drafting legal
documents for future litigation, contrary to his representations to Charles.
2.10.3
Preparation and Filing of Legal Documents
On December 17, 2023, while Morgan was allegedly having Dan help her prepare documents
in Oklahoma, her grandmother served Charles an eviction notice claiming that a protective
order had been filed, despite no such order existing at that time. Morgan returned and
continued to cohabit with Charles.

On December 18, 2023, Morgan filed for divorce claiming to be indigent, despite having just
transferred $1,576 from the joint account. Significantly, she waived the 60-day waiting period
for the divorce by claiming an active protection order already existed against Charles and
that family violence had occurred during the marriage. She also allegedly misrepresented her
financial status, claiming responsibility for bills that Charles actually paid.
On December 19, 2023, Dan contacted Charles via text, falsely representing himself as
Morgan’s attorney, referring to her as “his client,” and stating that he wished to “work
together to write up the decree.” He claimed he had “never lied to Charles” and had disclosed
all his plans from the outset.
Despite claiming she already had an active protective order, Morgan filed for another one on
December 22, 2023, alleging family violence occurred on December 18, 2023. On December
27, 2023, Charles was served with a formal eviction, scheduled for January 17, 2024.
2.10.4
Court Proceedings and Removal from Residence
The first show cause hearing was held on January 16, 2024, resulting in Charles being removed
from the family home before any substantive hearing occurred. The case was reset for January
22, 2024, so the parties could obtain legal counsel. Meanwhile, on January 17, 2024, the
eviction case was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
At the January 22, 2024 hearing, Morgan approached attorney Cooper L. Carter in the
courtroom lobby and hired her on the spot, resulting in another delay until February 1, 2024.
At the February 1 hearing, Charles’s attorney advised him to settle despite his objections.
The resulting settlement gave Charles until March 1 to remain in the family residence but
simultaneously removed the children from their home.
2.10.5
Subsequent Legal Challenges
On February 8, 2024, Charles fired his attorney and filed an emergency motion to vacate the
agreement and reconsider evidence, with a hearing scheduled for March 14, 2024. On March
3, 2024, Charles filed a notice with the court explaining that he would not leave the home
until after the hearing. Three days later, on March 6, 2024, Morgan allegedly locked Charles

out of the home illegally.
At the March 14, 2024 hearing, Morgan’s attorney allegedly ambushed Charles before the
proceedings and served him with the temporary orders that were the subject of his challenge.
The associate judge denied his emergency motion and compelled Charles to sign the settlement
he opposed. When Charles refused, the judge signed the orders anyway.
2.10.6
One Year Later: Continuing Legal Battles
The case remained in this state for approximately one year, during which time Charles was
allegedly prevented from accessing his residence. On March 19, 2025, Charles opened a
separate SAPCR seeking emergency relief from being locked out of his house.
On March 28, 2025, after the parties agreed to an April 10 date for a full TRO hearing,
Charles was denied the opportunity to be heard. The court relied on a promise by Cooper
Carter to file a motion to consolidate in the first court, which did not occur until a week
later.
On April 10, 2025, the second court granted Cooper’s motion sua sponte without a hearing
and without notice. Charles’s mandamus petition was denied per curiam the following day.

2.11.1
False Allegations of Family Violence
The record suggests several instances where false allegations of family violence may have
been made to gain tactical advantages in the divorce proceedings:
1. Claim of Existing Protective Order: Morgan’s divorce petition allegedly claimed
an active protective order existed when no such order had been granted. This claim
was used to waive the statutory 60-day waiting period for divorce.
2. Inconsistent Protective Order Filings: Despite claiming an active protective
order already existed, Morgan filed for another protective order on December 22, 2023,
suggesting the previous claim was false.

removal from the family residence on January 16, 2024, without the hearing required by
Texas Family Code § 6.405(b).

Misrepresentation of Financial Status
The case presents several concerning financial misrepresentations:
1. False Indigence Claim: Morgan allegedly filed for divorce claiming to be indigent
despite having just transferred $1,576 from the joint account to Dan Branthoover’s
PayPal account.
2. Misattribution of Financial Responsibilities: Morgan allegedly claimed responsi-
bility for bills that Charles actually paid, misrepresenting the financial dynamics of the
household.
3. Unauthorized Financial Transactions: The transfer of $1,576 from the joint account
to Dan Branthoover’s PayPal account occurred without Charles’s knowledge or consent,
potentially constituting financial misconduct.
These financial misrepresentations may have influenced the court’s initial determinations
regarding temporary support and property control, creating an unfair advantage based on
false information.

Improper Preparation of Legal Documents

law.
2. Representation Claims: Dan’s December 19, 2023 text message referring to Morgan
as “his client” suggests he was holding himself out as an attorney.

A. Texas Rule 12 Challenge to Attorney Authority
2.12.1
Legal Standard for Challenging Attorney Authority
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12 provides a specific mechanism for challenging an attorney’s
authority to represent a party in litigation. The rule states:
“A party in a suit or proceeding pending in a court of this state may, by sworn written
motion stating that he believes the suit or proceeding is being prosecuted or defended without
authority, cause the attorney to be cited to appear before the court and show his authority
to act.”
This rule establishes a formal procedure with several key elements:
1. The challenge must be made through a sworn written motion
2. The motion must state the belief that the suit is being prosecuted or defended without
authority
3. The challenged attorney must be served notice at least ten days before the hearing
4. At the hearing, the burden of proof is on the challenged attorney to show sufficient
authority
5. If the attorney fails to show authority, the court shall refuse to permit the attorney to

The Texas Supreme Court has clarified that Rule 12 serves to protect parties from unauthorized
representation and to ensure that attorneys appearing in court have proper authority from
their purported clients.

Application to Cooper Carter’s Representation
In the Myers case, several aspects of Cooper Carter’s representation raise questions that
could be addressed through a Rule 12 challenge:
1. Retention Circumstances: Cooper was allegedly retained in the courtroom lobby on
January 22, 2024, immediately before a hearing, raising questions about the formality
and scope of the attorney-client relationship.

2.12 A. Texas Rule 12 Challenge to Attorney Authority

2.12.1 Legal Standard for Challenging Attorney Authority

Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12 provides a specific mechanism for challenging an attorney’s

authority to represent a party in litigation. The rule states:

“A party in a suit or proceeding pending in a court of this state may, by sworn written
motion stating that he believes the suit or proceeding is being prosecuted or defended without
authority, cause the attorney to be cited to appear before the court and show his authority

to act.”
This rule establishes a formal procedure with several key elements:

1. The challenge must be made through a sworn written motion

2. The motion must state the belief that the suit is being prosecuted or defended without
authority

3. The challenged attorney must be served notice at least ten days before the hearing

4. At the hearing, the burden of proof is on the challenged attorney to show sufficient
authority

5. If the attorney fails to show authority, the court shall refuse to permit the attorney to

appear and shall strike the pleadings

The Texas Supreme Court has clarified that Rule 12 serves to protect parties from unauthorized
representation and to ensure that attorneys appearing in court have proper authority from

their purported clients.

2. Filing Practices: Cooper’s filings were allegedly filed on her behalf by Roderick D.
Marx, a party not named in the lawsuit, creating questions about who was actually
directing the litigation.
3. Firm Affiliation Discrepancies: Cooper allegedly claimed on social media and
LinkedIn to have previously worked at Marx Altman and Johnson (where Roderick
D. Marx is the owner), while her Electronic Filing Manager account was registered
to another firm, Cantey Hanger, creating confusion about her actual professional
affiliations.
4. Representation Capacity: If Cooper claimed to represent Morgan in her “individual
capacity” rather than as a member of a firm, this would create a direct attorney-client
relationship that wouldn’t automatically extend filing privileges to other attorneys,
including founding partners of firms she was previously associated with.
These circumstances could form the basis of a Rule 12 challenge, requiring Cooper to
demonstrate her authority to represent Morgan in the divorce proceedings.
2.12.3
Electronic Filing Irregularities
The electronic filing practices in this case present particularly concerning procedural issues:
1. Third-Party Filing: Texas electronic filing requirements specify that attorneys must
maintain control and responsibility over their electronic filings. The alleged practice of
having Roderick D. Marx file documents on Cooper’s behalf raises serious questions
about proper representation.
2. Credential Misuse: In Texas, attorneys representing clients in court proceedings must
use their own electronic filing credentials when submitting documents. It is improper for
an attorney to have another person file documents using that other person’s credentials,
especially if that person is not a party of record.
3. Firm Relationship Questions: If Cooper was practicing independently while docu-
ments were being filed through Marx’s credentials, this creates questions about whether
Marx was authorized to act on her behalf or whether there was an undisclosed profes-

sional relationship.
4. Mandatory E-Filing Requirements: Texas mandates e-filing for all attorneys in
civil, family, probate, and criminal cases in district and county courts. This requirement
creates an expectation that attorneys will personally manage their filings or have
properly supervised staff do so under their credentials.
These electronic filing irregularities could potentially constitute improper practice and might
provide grounds for challenging the validity of the filings themselves.
2.12.4
Implications of Improper Representation
If a Rule 12 challenge were to succeed in establishing improper representation, the implications
would be significant:
1. Striking of Pleadings: The court would be required to strike all pleadings filed by
the attorney lacking authority, potentially invalidating orders based on those pleadings.
2. Procedural Reset: The case might need to be reset procedurally to the point before
the unauthorized representation began.
3. Ethical Implications: Unauthorized representation could trigger ethical investigations
by the State Bar of Texas.
4. Validity of Orders: Orders obtained through unauthorized representation could be
subject to challenge as void or voidable.
5. Malpractice Concerns: Improper representation could potentially expose the attor-
neys involved to malpractice claims.
The Rule 12 challenge mechanism thus provides a powerful tool for addressing question-
able representation practices that may have prejudiced Charles’s position in the divorce
proceedings.

B. Dominant Jurisdiction Analysis
2.13.1
Competing Court Jurisdictions
The Myers case involves competing jurisdictions between divorce proceedings and a separately
filed SAPCR (Suit Affecting the Parent-Child Relationship), creating a complex jurisdictional
landscape:
1. Original Divorce Proceeding: Filed on December 18, 2023, this case would normally
have dominant jurisdiction over all matters related to the marriage and children.
2. Separate SAPCR: Filed on March 19, 2025, seeking emergency relief from being
locked out of the house for over a year.
3. Jurisdictional Conflict: The filing of the separate SAPCR created a situation where
two courts had potential jurisdiction over matters affecting the parent-child relationship.
Under Texas law, when two courts have concurrent jurisdiction over the same controversy, the
first court to acquire jurisdiction generally has dominant jurisdiction. This principle, known
as the “first-in-time rule,” is designed to prevent forum shopping and conflicting rulings from
different courts.
2.13.2
SAPCR and Divorce Case Consolidation Requirements
Texas Family Code creates specific requirements regarding the consolidation of SAPCR and
divorce cases:
1. Mandatory Consolidation: Texas Family Code § 6.406 requires all pending SAPCRs
to be transferred to the court in which the divorce is filed.
2. Transfer Procedure: After showing that a divorce has been filed in another court,
the court in which a SAPCR is pending must transfer the proceedings to the divorce
court.
3. Continuing Exclusive Jurisdiction: Once a court issues a final order in a SAPCR,
that court has continuing exclusive jurisdiction over future related matters.

These provisions reflect a legislative preference for having all family matters related to the
same parties heard in a single court to promote judicial efficiency and prevent inconsistent
rulings.
2.13.3
Exceptions to Dominant Jurisdiction Doctrine
While the first-in-time rule generally governs jurisdictional conflicts, Texas law recognizes
important exceptions to the dominant jurisdiction doctrine:
1. Lack of Prosecution: If the suit in the first court is not being actively prosecuted,
the second court may maintain jurisdiction despite not being first in time.
2. Bad Faith Filing: If the suit was filed in bad faith or for the purpose of delay, the
second court may disregard the first court’s dominant jurisdiction.
In the Myers case, both exceptions could potentially apply:
• Lack of Prosecution: The alleged inactivity in the divorce case for approximately a
year, with Cooper Carter allegedly not filing any pleadings between April 24, 2024, and
responding to the separate SAPCR, could constitute lack of prosecution.
• Bad Faith Filing: The allegations of false claims in the original divorce petition, in-
cluding misrepresentations about protective orders and family violence, could potentially
establish that the original suit was brought in bad faith.
These exceptions provide potential legal grounds for challenging the automatic application of
the dominant jurisdiction doctrine.
2.13.4
Application to the Myers Case
The jurisdictional issues in the Myers case present several concerning procedural aspects:
1. Denial of Hearing: On March 28, 2025, Charles was allegedly denied the opportunity
to be heard on his emergency TRO in the second court based on a promise by Cooper
Carter to file a motion to consolidate in the first court—a promise that wasn’t fulfilled
until a week later.

2.14.1
Motions to Vacate Orders Based on False Allegations
When court orders have been obtained through false allegations, several procedural mecha-

1. Motion for New Trial: Within 30 days of an order being signed, a party can file a
motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence that the allegations underlying
the order were false. This remedy is time-limited but provides a direct means to address
recent orders.
2. Bill of Review: For orders that have become final, a bill of review is an equitable
proceeding to set aside a judgment that is no longer appealable or subject to a motion
for new trial. To succeed, the petitioner must generally show:
• A meritorious defense to the cause of action
• Which the petitioner was prevented from making by fraud, accident, or wrongful
act of the opposing party
• Unmixed with any fault or negligence of the petitioner

be considered void rather than merely voidable. A motion to vacate can be filed at any
time to challenge void orders, as they are considered a nullity from their inception.
4. Collateral Attack: In some circumstances, orders based on false allegations can be
collaterally attacked in a separate proceeding when they form the basis for subsequent
legal actions.
In the Myers case, the emergency motion filed on February 8, 2024, to vacate the agreement
and reconsider evidence represents an attempt to utilize these remedial procedures. The
denial of this motion on March 14, 2024, without addressing the underlying allegations of
falsity, illustrates the practical challenges in obtaining relief even when procedural mechanisms
exist.
2.14.2
Sanctions Against Parties Making False Statements
Texas law provides multiple avenues for seeking sanctions against parties who make false
statements in court proceedings:
1. Chapter 10 Sanctions: Under Chapter 10 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies
Code, courts can impose sanctions for signing pleadings that are presented for an
improper purpose or contain factual contentions without evidentiary support. These
sanctions can include:
• Monetary penalties
• Striking pleadings
• Dismissal of claims
• Attorney’s fees awards
2. Rule 13 Sanctions: Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 13 allows sanctions for groundless
pleadings brought in bad faith or for harassment. The rule requires notice and hearing
before sanctions can be imposed.
3. Inherent Authority: Texas courts have inherent authority to sanction parties for
abuse of the judicial process, including making false statements to the court.

of court, which can be punished by fines or incarceration.
These sanctions serve both punitive and deterrent functions, providing consequences for past
misconduct and discouraging future false allegations.
2.14.3
Potential Claims Against Third Parties
When third parties assist in making false allegations, additional legal remedies may be
available:
1. Civil Conspiracy: If evidence shows that multiple parties conspired to present false
allegations to the court, a civil conspiracy claim might be viable. The elements typically
include:
• Two or more persons
• An object to be accomplished
• A meeting of minds on the object or course of action
• One or more unlawful, overt acts
• Damages as the proximate result
2. Tortious Interference: If a third party interfered with the marital relationship or
parent-child relationship through false allegations, a tortious interference claim might
be appropriate.
3. Unauthorized Practice of Law Claims: For non-attorneys who provided legal
advice or prepared legal documents, a complaint to the Unauthorized Practice of Law
Committee of the Texas Supreme Court could lead to injunctive relief and civil penalties.
4. Bar Complaints: For licensed attorneys who facilitated false allegations, grievances
can be filed with the State Bar of Texas, potentially resulting in disciplinary action.
In the Myers case, the alleged involvement of Daniel Branthoover in preparing legal documents
and facilitating financial transactions could potentially expose him to such third-party claims.

B. Jurisdictional Strategies
2.15.1
Challenging Improper Venue
Venue challenges provide a potential strategy for addressing cases filed in inappropriate
locations:
1. Motion to Transfer Venue: If a case is filed in a county where venue is improper, a
motion to transfer venue can be filed to move the case to the proper county. In family
law matters, venue is generally proper in the county where the child has resided for the
preceding six-month period.
2. Mandatory vs. Permissive Venue: Some venue provisions are mandatory, while
others are permissive. Mandatory venue provisions provide stronger grounds for transfer.
3. Timeliness Requirements: Venue challenges must typically be made at the outset of
litigation, before other substantive pleadings are filed.
In the Myers case, the residence at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148, establishes
the proper venue for the divorce and related proceedings. Any attempt to file in a different
county could be challenged through these mechanisms.
2.15.2
Transfer and Consolidation of Related Cases
Strategic use of transfer and consolidation provisions can help manage multiple related
proceedings:
1. Mandatory Transfer Provisions: Texas Family Code § 6.407(b) and § 155.202
provide that when a divorce is filed in a different court than an existing SAPCR, either
party may request transfer of the SAPCR to the divorce court, and the SAPCR court
“shall” transfer jurisdiction.
2. Consolidation Motions: Once cases are in the same court, a motion to consolidate can
be filed to have all matters heard together, promoting judicial efficiency and preventing
inconsistent rulings.

2.15 B. Jurisdictional Strategies

2.15.1 Challenging Improper Venue

Venue challenges provide a potential strategy for addressing cases filed in inappropriate

locations:

1. Motion to Transfer Venue: If a case is filed in a county where venue is improper, a
motion to transfer venue can be filed to move the case to the proper county. In family
law matters, venue is generally proper in the county where the child has resided for the

preceding six-month period.

2. Mandatory vs. Permissive Venue: Some venue provisions are mandatory, while

others are permissive. Mandatory venue provisions provide stronger grounds for transfer.

3. Timeliness Requirements: Venue challenges must typically be made at the outset of

litigation, before other substantive pleadings are filed.

In the Myers case, the residence at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148, establishes
the proper venue for the divorce and related proceedings. Any attempt to file in a different

county could be challenged through these mechanisms.

2.15.2 Transfer and Consolidation of Related Cases

Strategic use of transfer and consolidation provisions can help manage multiple related

proceedings:

1. Mandatory Transfer Provisions: Texas Family Code § 6.407(b) and § 155.202
provide that when a divorce is filed in a different court than an existing SAPCR, either
party may request transfer of the SAPCR to the divorce court, and the SAPCR court

“shall” transfer jurisdiction.

2. Consolidation Motions: Once cases are in the same court, a motion to consolidate can
be filed to have all matters heard together, promoting judicial efficiency and preventing

inconsistent rulings.

3. Strategic Timing: The timing of transfer and consolidation requests can be strategi-
cally important, particularly when one court may be more favorable than another.
In the Myers case, the competing SAPCR and divorce proceedings created a complex
jurisdictional landscape that could potentially be navigated through strategic use of these
transfer and consolidation provisions.
2.15.3
Federal Court Removal Considerations
In certain limited circumstances, family law matters that would normally be heard in state
court can be removed to federal court:
1. Diversity Jurisdiction: While domestic relations matters are generally excluded from
federal diversity jurisdiction, certain collateral matters with diverse citizenship and
sufficient amount in controversy might be removable.
2. Federal Question Jurisdiction: If a family law dispute involves federal constitutional
questions, such as due process violations, removal might be possible.
3. Strategic Purpose: Even when the likelihood of successful removal is low, the removal
process itself can create procedural hurdles for the opposing party, potentially creating
leverage for settlement.
In the Myers case, the December 2, 2024, removal of the divorce case to federal court appears
to have been a strategic maneuver designed to place procedural burdens on Cooper Carter,
specifically the requirement to file a certified copy of the notice of remand with the clerk.
2.16
C. Addressing Attorney Misconduct
2.16.1
Rule 12 Procedures
As discussed in the previous section, Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12 provides a specific
mechanism for challenging an attorney’s authority:
1. Procedural Requirements: The challenge must be made through a sworn motion,
served at least ten days before the hearing.

Page 31
2. Burden of Proof: At the hearing, the burden is on the challenged attorney to prove
authority to represent the client.
3. Timing Considerations: The motion can be heard at any time before the parties
announce ready for trial, making it a flexible tool throughout litigation.
4. Potential Outcomes: If successful, the court must refuse to permit the attorney to
appear and must strike the pleadings if no authorized person appears.
The September 20, 2024, Rule 12 challenge filed by Charles represents an attempt to utilize
this procedure to address concerns about Cooper Carter’s representation.
2.16.2
Bar Complaints
The State Bar of Texas disciplinary system provides another avenue for addressing attorney
misconduct:
1. Grievance Process: Complaints about attorney misconduct are filed with the Office
of Chief Disciplinary Counsel, which investigates and determines whether just cause
exists to believe misconduct occurred.
2. Potential Sanctions: If misconduct is found, sanctions can range from private
reprimand to disbarment, depending on the severity of the violation.
3. Relevant Rules: The Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct prohibit
various forms of misconduct, including:
• Rule 3.01: Meritorious Claims and Contentions
• Rule 3.03: Candor Toward the Tribunal
• Rule 4.01: Truthfulness in Statements to Others
• Rule 8.04: Misconduct
4. Evidentiary Standard: The standard of proof in disciplinary proceedings is “prepon-
derance of the evidence,” lower than the criminal standard.
While bar complaints do not directly affect the underlying litigation, they can create profes-
sional consequences for attorneys who engage in misconduct and may indirectly influence

divorce proceedings:
1. Statutory Violations: The case presents potential violations of Texas Family Code §
6.405(b), which requires a hearing within 14 days when family violence is alleged in a
divorce case. Charles was removed from his residence on January 16, 2024, without the
statutorily required hearing to evaluate the allegations.
2. False Allegations Pattern: The timeline reveals a pattern of potentially false
allegations, including claims of an active protective order that did not exist, inconsistent
protective order filings, and allegations of family violence that appear contradicted by
continued cohabitation.
3. Third-Party Interference: Daniel Branthoover’s involvement raises serious concerns
about unauthorized practice of law and improper influence on the legal proceedings,
including document preparation and financial transactions that disadvantaged Charles.
4. Attorney Representation Issues: Cooper Carter’s representation presents procedural
irregularities, including electronic filing practices where documents were allegedly filed
by Roderick D. Marx rather than Carter herself, raising Rule 12 concerns about proper
authority.
5. Jurisdictional Manipulation: The handling of competing court jurisdictions be-
tween the divorce and separate SAPCR proceedings suggests potential manipulation of
procedural rules to prevent substantive consideration of Charles’s claims.
6. Due Process Concerns: Multiple instances of denied hearings, sua sponte rulings
without notice, and orders signed without consent raise significant due process concerns
throughout the proceedings.
7. Financial Misrepresentations: The alleged false claims of indigence, misrepresenta-
tion of financial responsibilities, and unauthorized transfer of funds from joint accounts
suggest a pattern of financial misconduct that may have influenced court determinations.
These findings collectively demonstrate how false allegations, procedural irregularities, and
third-party interference can fundamentally distort the legal process in divorce proceedings,

Strategic Recommendations
Based on our analysis, several strategic approaches could be considered to address the issues
identified in this case:
1. Comprehensive Rule 12 Challenge: A thorough Rule 12 challenge to Cooper
Carter’s authority to represent Morgan should be pursued, focusing on the electronic
filing irregularities and the role of Roderick D. Marx in filing documents on Carter’s
behalf.
2. Motion to Vacate Based on Fraud on the Court: A motion to vacate all orders
stemming from the allegedly fraudulent protective order claims should be filed, arguing
that orders obtained through false allegations constitute fraud on the court and are
therefore void.
3. Sanctions Motion for False Allegations: A motion for sanctions under Chapter
10 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code should be considered, targeting
the specific false allegations identified in the divorce petition and protective order
applications.
4. Bar Grievance Proceedings: Formal grievances should be filed with the State Bar
of Texas against any attorneys who facilitated or knowingly permitted false allegations,
unauthorized practice of law, or improper electronic filing practices.
5. Unauthorized Practice of Law Complaint: A complaint to the Unauthorized
Practice of Law Committee of the Texas Supreme Court regarding Daniel Branthoover’s
alleged legal document preparation and advice should be pursued.
6. Federal Due Process Claim: Given the pattern of procedural irregularities and
denied hearings, a federal court action alleging due process violations could be considered
as a parallel strategy to the state court proceedings.

on the statutory violation of Texas Family Code § 6.405(b) and the failure to conduct
the required hearing on family violence allegations could provide an avenue for appellate

8. Civil Action Against Third Parties: A separate civil action against Daniel
Branthoover for tortious interference, civil conspiracy, or similar claims could ad-

Potential Next Steps
Moving forward, the following immediate steps are recommended:
1. Document Collection and Preservation: Gather and preserve all evidence of the
alleged false statements, unauthorized practice, and procedural irregularities, including
text messages, bank statements, court filings, and electronic filing records.
2. Expert Consultation: Consult with experts in legal ethics, electronic filing procedures,
and unauthorized practice of law to strengthen the factual and legal basis for challenges
to the proceedings.
3. Affidavit Preparation: Prepare detailed affidavits documenting the timeline of events,
financial transactions, and communications that support claims of false allegations and
improper conduct.
4. Strategic Timing Analysis: Carefully analyze timing requirements for various
remedial options, prioritizing those with approaching deadlines while developing a
comprehensive long-term strategy.
5. Coordinated Legal Approach: Develop a coordinated approach that addresses both
the immediate need to regain access to the residence and the broader goal of remedying
the procedural injustices that have occurred throughout the proceedings.
6. Judicial Education: Prepare concise, focused presentations for the court that clearly
explain the statutory violations and procedural irregularities, with specific citations to

KEY LEGAL ISSUES
LEGAL PRECEDENTS AND AUTHORITIES
CONCLUSION AND PRAYER FOR RELIEF
INTRODUCTION
This case study presents a comprehensive examination of the legal proceedings
involving Charles Dustin Myers, a father and home-based business owner who has been
subjected to a series of procedural irregularities, false allegations, and questionable
legal maneuvers that have resulted in his forcible removal from his family home and
separation from his children. The case represents a troubling example of how the family
court system can be manipulated through false allegations, procedural technicalities,
and exploitation of legal processes, resulting in substantial injustice.
Charles Dustin Myers and Morgan Michelle Myers were married on June 20, 2015, and
resided together at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148 with their two young
daughters, Mara Evonne Myers (age 8) and Caroline Rose Myers (age 6). Their family life
proceeded without documented incidents of violence or abuse until December 1, 2023,
when Morgan abruptly announced her desire for divorce. What followed was not a
standard dissolution of marriage proceeding, but rather a calculated campaign to
remove Charles from his home and children through false allegations, financial
manipulation, and procedural maneuvering.
This case study will demonstrate how Morgan Myers, with the assistance of her
stepfather Daniel Branthoover and attorney Cooper L. Carter, engaged in a pattern of
conduct designed to circumvent proper legal procedures and deprive Charles of his
rights. The timeline reveals a troubling sequence: the discovery of Morgan's extensive
communications with individuals outside the marriage, her immediate attempt to
secure emergency protective orders based on fabricated claims of family violence, the
draining of joint financial accounts while simultaneously claiming financial indigency,
and the procurement of court orders without proper evidentiary hearings or findings.
The legal issues presented in this case are significant and far-reaching. They include
violations of Texas Family Code Section 6.405(b), which requires specific hearings when
family violence is alleged in divorce proceedings; questions about attorney authority
and electronic filing requirements under Texas Rules of Civil Procedure; concerns about
dominant jurisdiction when multiple courts become involved; and fundamental due
process violations when court orders are issued without proper evidence or findings.
Most critically, this case study will demonstrate how Charles Myers has been
systematically denied meaningful access to justice despite his diligent efforts to follow
proper legal channels. Over the course of more than a year, Charles has filed numerous

INTRODUCTION

This case study presents a comprehensive examination of the legal proceedings
involving Charles Dustin Myers, a father and home-based business owner who has been
subjected to a series of procedural irregularities, false allegations, and questionable
legal maneuvers that have resulted in his forcible removal from his family home and
separation from his children. The case represents a troubling example of how the family
court system can be manipulated through false allegations, procedural technicalities,
and exploitation of legal processes, resulting in substantial injustice.

Charles Dustin Myers and Morgan Michelle Myers were married on June 20, 2015, and

resided together at Pe with their two young
daughters, vie zs MB (age 8) and ima | vi (age 6). Their family life
proceeded without documented incidents of violence or abuse until December 1, 2023,
when Morgan abruptly announced her desire for divorce. What followed was not a
standard dissolution of marriage proceeding, but rather a calculated campaign to
remove Charles from his home and children through false allegations, financial
manipulation, and procedural maneuvering.

This case study will demonstrate how Morgan Myers, with the assistance of her
stepfather Daniel Branthoover and attorney Cooper L. Carter, engaged in a pattern of
conduct designed to circumvent proper legal procedures and deprive Charles of his
rights. The timeline reveals a troubling sequence: the discovery of Morgan's extensive
communications with individuals outside the marriage, her immediate attempt to
secure emergency protective orders based on fabricated claims of family violence, the
draining of joint financial accounts while simultaneously claiming financial indigency,
and the procurement of court orders without proper evidentiary hearings or findings.

The legal issues presented in this case are significant and far-reaching. They include
violations of Texas Family Code Section 6.405(b), which requires specific hearings when
family violence is alleged in divorce proceedings; questions about attorney authority
and electronic filing requirements under Texas Rules of Civil Procedure; concerns about
dominant jurisdiction when multiple courts become involved; and fundamental due
process violations when court orders are issued without proper evidence or findings.

Most critically, this case study will demonstrate how Charles Myers has been
systematically denied meaningful access to justice despite his diligent efforts to follow
M.37690per legal channels. Over the course of more than a year, Charles has filed numerousvl.3769

motions, petitions for writs of mandamus to multiple courts, and requests for
emergency relief—all while being locked out of his home, separated from his children,
and unable to effectively operate his business that requires reliable internet access.
The higher court's review of this case is not merely about correcting errors in a single
family law matter. It represents an opportunity to address systemic issues that
undermine the integrity of the family court system and to ensure that procedural
safeguards are not merely theoretical protections but practical realities for all litigants.
When false allegations can be leveraged to secure emergency orders without evidence,
when attorneys can file documents through improper channels without consequence,
and when courts can issue life-altering decisions without proper hearings, the
fundamental promise of due process is broken.
This case study will present a detailed chronology of events, analyze the legal
implications of the proceedings, and demonstrate why intervention by a higher court is
not only justified but necessary to prevent a continuing miscarriage of justice. Charles
Myers's story is not merely a personal tragedy; it is a cautionary tale about the
vulnerabilities in our family court system and the urgent need for vigilant protection of
procedural rights for all parties in divorce and custody proceedings.

THE STORY OF CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS: A NARRATIVE
FOR THE HIGHER COURT
I. FAMILY BACKGROUND AND CIRCUMSTANCES PRIOR TO DIVORCE
Charles Dustin Myers was a devoted husband and father who built his life around his
family. After marrying Morgan Michelle Myers on June 20, 2015, the couple established
their home at 6641 Anne Court in Watauga, Texas. Together, they welcomed two
daughters into the world: Mara Evonne Myers, born June 20, 2016, and Caroline Rose
Myers, born April 12, 2018. 
In January 2021, Charles made a significant professional transition by establishing a
home-based business specializing in real-time market data solutions. This decision
allowed him to be more present for his young daughters while still providing for his
family financially. Charles's business served clients across the United States and Canada,
requiring reliable internet connectivity that he had specifically upgraded in September
2023 to ensure optimal service delivery.
Charles embraced his role as an active and involved father. He took his daughters to
school each morning, helped them with their homework in the afternoons, prepared
their meals, gave them baths, and was a constant, nurturing presence in their lives.
While Morgan worked evening shifts, Charles was the primary caregiver, ensuring the
girls maintained a stable routine and received the attention and care they needed during
their formative years.
By all outward appearances, the Myers family represented a typical American household
—parents balancing work responsibilities while raising young children, establishing
roots in their community, and building a future together. There were no documented
incidents of family violence, no history of substance abuse, and no prior involvement
with family courts or protective services. Charles had no criminal record, as evidenced

|. FAMILY BACKGROUND AND CIRCUMSTANCES PRIOR TO DIVORCE

Charles Dustin Myers was a devoted husband and father who built his life around his

In January 2021, Charles made a significant professional transition by establishing a

allowed him to be more present for his young daughters while still providing for his
family financially. Charles's business served clients across the United States and Canada,

by his clean Texas Department of Public Safety records that would later be submitted to
the court.
II. THE UNEXPECTED DISSOLUTION
The first sign of trouble came without warning on December 1, 2023, when Morgan
abruptly announced her desire for divorce. This declaration came as a complete shock to
Charles, who had no indication that his wife was contemplating ending their marriage.
What Charles did not know at the time was that this announcement would mark the
beginning of a calculated campaign to remove him from his home and children through
a series of coordinated legal maneuvers.
On December 12, 2023, Charles made a disturbing discovery that shed light on Morgan's
sudden decision. While reviewing their joint AT&T account, he uncovered evidence of
over 16,500 text messages exchanged between Morgan and two individuals outside their
marriage—primarily with a man named Damen Kazlauskas—spanning from October
2022 to December 2023. This revelation suggested that Morgan had been engaged in an
extramarital relationship for over a year prior to announcing her desire for divorce.
When confronted with this evidence, Morgan denied any wrongdoing, dismissing the
extensive communications as merely "emotional support." She immediately began
distancing herself from Charles and excluding him from any conversations regarding the
divorce. On December 13, 2023, Morgan had a private conversation with her
grandparents who lived next door, a discussion that lasted from 9:30 AM until 1:30 AM
the following morning.
III. THE ORCHESTRATED LEGAL STRATEGY BEGINS
The day after this extended family conversation, on December 14, 2023, Morgan made
her first attempt to obtain an emergency order of protection against Charles—a fact that
would only later be revealed in her divorce petition. This attempt occurred without
Charles's knowledge and despite there being no incidents of violence or threats that
would justify such an order.
On December 15, 2023, a new player entered the situation: Daniel Branthoover, Morgan's
stepfather. Between 7:22 AM and 8:39 AM that morning, Daniel and Morgan exchanged
21 text messages. At 9:41 AM, Daniel texted Charles directly, requesting that he call
regarding the recent divorce announcement. During their subsequent telephone
conversation, Daniel convinced Charles that allowing Morgan to bring the children to his
residence in Yukon, Oklahoma for the weekend would be "a good move." Daniel
presented himself as a neutral party who wanted to help both Charles and Morgan
navigate the divorce amicably.

After this call, Daniel resumed texting Morgan, exchanging an additional 9 messages
between 10:03 AM and 10:07 AM. What appeared to be a gesture of goodwill from a
concerned family member was, in reality, the beginning of a coordinated plan to
disadvantage Charles in the impending legal proceedings.
IV. FINANCIAL MANIPULATION AND DECEPTION
The true nature of Daniel's involvement became clear the very next day. On December
16, 2023, Charles was notified that his bank account had been overdrawn by $800. When
he contacted Daniel at 3:54 PM requesting that funds be returned, Daniel falsely claimed
that Morgan had transferred money to her own account, asserting that Texas is a
community property state as justification.
However, Charles's bank statement from December 2023 revealed the truth: $1,576 had
been transferred to "dmb575," a PayPal account belonging to Daniel Branthoover. When
confronted about these transactions, Daniel's response revealed that his true intent
regarding Morgan's visit to his residence was to assist her in drafting legal documents for
future litigation.
During this same period, Daniel advised or purchased a second phone for Morgan,
registered under the number 817-940-0852, along with a can of pepper spray mace. This
new phone number would subsequently appear on the original petition for divorce filed
on December 18, 2023, on an affidavit of inability to pay court costs filed the same day,
and on an application for a protective order filed on December 22, 2023—all prepared
under Daniel's direction.
V. EVICTION ATTEMPT AND FALSE CLAIMS
While Morgan was at Daniel's residence in Oklahoma, allegedly preparing legal
documents, she orchestrated another troubling action. On December 17, 2023, at 11:00
AM, Morgan's grandmother served Charles with an eviction notice. The stated grounds
for eviction were:
"Granddaughter getting divorced."
"Protective order has been filed."
"He must leave, the girls and she may stay."
Notably, no protective order had been filed at that time, making this claim demonstrably
false. Morgan returned to Texas later that day and continued to cohabit with Charles in
the family home, despite the eviction notice and her claims of feeling unsafe.
The following day, December 18, 2023, Morgan filed for divorce claiming financial
indigency—this despite having just transferred $1,576 from the joint account days

earlier. She requested assistance for uncontested cases and submitted her original
petition for divorce. Within this petition, Morgan falsely claimed that she had an active
order of protection against Charles due to a finding of family violence during the
marriage. She also claimed both family vehicles as separate property and asserted that
she or the children would be harassed or abused if Charles were given contact
information.
Morgan's petition also sought to waive the standard 60-day waiting period for divorce
based on the false claim that family violence had occurred during the marriage. Four
days later, on December 22, 2023, Morgan filed for an additional protective order, now
claiming that family violence had occurred on December 18, 2023—after her divorce
filing.
VI. CHARLES'S LEGAL RESPONSE AND DEFENSE PREPARATION
On December 27, 2023, Charles was served with the formal eviction, scheduled for
January 17, 2024. Once served with the divorce papers, Charles began preparing his
defense. On January 2, 2024, he filed an answer to the divorce petition and provided two
attachments, including his Texas Department of Public Safety records showing no
history of violence.
Charles then filed a motion to consolidate on January 3, 2024, and provided a
background report to provide insight into the children's family dynamics. On January 8,
2024, he filed a motion for continuance and provided further documentation to the
court, including text message evidence that Morgan had lied about her financial status
and fabricated her claims of indigency.
On January 13, 2024, Charles filed an unsworn declaration with the court reiterating the
facts established up to that point. Throughout this period, Charles continued to reside in
the family home with Morgan and their daughters, with no incidents of violence or
threats—a fact that directly contradicted Morgan's claims of feeling unsafe.
VII. THE FIRST HEARING AND REMOVAL FROM THE HOME
On January 16, 2024, the parties arrived at the show cause hearing, marking Morgan's
only appearance found in the case docket. Without any evidence being presented,
witnesses called, findings made, or statutory authority cited, the court exceeded its
jurisdiction and ordered Charles to vacate the family home at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga,
Texas 76148. The court gave no consideration to the well-being of the children, the
family's home environment, or Charles's work situation that required him to have
reliable internet access.

This devastating decision forced Charles to stay temporarily with his father in Flower
Mound, Texas while he sought legal representation. With less than a week to find an
attorney, Charles retained Dan Bacalis of Hurst, Texas for $3,000 and briefed him on the
situation.
On January 17, 2024, the eviction case against Charles was dismissed for lack of subject
matter jurisdiction—a vindication that came too late, as he had already been ordered to
leave his home by the family court.
VIII. CONTINUED DELAYS AND LEGAL MANEUVERING
Ready to hold Morgan accountable, Charles and his attorney appeared on January 22,
2024, at the reset hearing, only to face another delay. Morgan had acquired attorney
Cooper L. Carter in the courtroom lobby immediately before the hearing, resulting in the
case being postponed again until February 1, 2024. This last-minute tactic extended
Charles's separation from his home and normal family life.
Between the second and third hearings, each counsel amended their respective
petitions. Neither the Counterpetition for Divorce nor the Original Petition for Divorce
was served on Charles or Morgan, as stated in each petition.
IX. THE FEBRUARY HEARING AND SETTLEMENT UNDER DURESS
The parties went to court on February 1, 2024, ostensibly to hold a hearing regarding
Morgan's protective order claims. Rather than conducting this hearing, Charles's own
counsel, Dan Bacalis, drafted and presented a settlement agreement in the form of an
"Agreed" Associate Judge's Report. This report gave Charles one month back in the
home he had just been removed from and kept full custody of the children with Morgan.
Left with no alternative and feeling pressured by his own attorney, Charles reluctantly
signed the agreement. He immediately terminated Dan Bacalis for his failure to
adequately represent him and notified the court on February 5, 2024. An agreed motion
for withdrawal followed on February 6, and Charles proceeded pro se (representing
himself).
Without Charles's knowledge or consent, an "Agreed" order of consolidation was
rendered on February 8, 2024, missing his signature. On this same day, Charles filed an
EMERGENCY MOTION to challenge Morgan's allegations and present his evidence to the
court. This evidence included:

This devastating decision forced Charles to stay temporarily with his father in Flower
Mound, Texas while he sought legal representation. With less than a week to find an
attorney, Charles retained Dan Bacalis of Hurst, Texas for $3,000 and briefed him on the
situation.

On January 17, 2024, the eviction case against Charles was dismissed for lack of subject
matter jurisdiction—a vindication that came too late, as he had already been ordered to
leave his home by the family court.

VIII. CONTINUED DELAYS AND LEGAL MANEUVERING

Ready to hold Morgan accountable, Charles and his attorney appeared on January 22,
2024, at the reset hearing, only to face another delay. Morgan had acquired attorney
Cooper L. Carter in the courtroom lobby immediately before the hearing, resulting in the
case being postponed again until February 1, 2024. This last-minute tactic extended
Charles's separation from his home and normal family life.

Between the second and third hearings, each counsel amended their respective
petitions. Neither the Counterpetition for Divorce nor the Original Petition for Divorce
was served on Charles or Morgan, as stated in each petition.

IX. THE FEBRUARY HEARING AND SETTLEMENT UNDER DURESS

The parties went to court on February 1, 2024, ostensibly to hold a hearing regarding
Morgan's protective order claims. Rather than conducting this hearing, Charles's own
counsel, Dan Bacalis, drafted and presented a settlement agreement in the form of an
"Agreed" Associate Judge's Report. This report gave Charles one month back in the
home he had just been removed from and kept full custody of the children with Morgan.

Left with no alternative and feeling pressured by his own attorney, Charles reluctantly
signed the agreement. He immediately terminated Dan Bacalis for his failure to
adequately represent him and notified the court on February 5, 2024. An agreed motion
for withdrawal followed on February 6, and Charles proceeded pro se (representing
himself).

Without Charles's knowledge or consent, an "Agreed" order of consolidation was
rendered on February 8, 2024, missing his signature. On this same day, Charles filed an
EMERGENCY MOTION to challenge Morgan's allegations and present his evidence to the
court. This evidence included:

X. ESCALATING LEGAL BATTLES AND LOCKOUT
On February 8, 2024, an order of withdrawal for attorney Bacalis was served on the
parties. Charles filed a motion for summary judgment on February 22, 2024, and the
parties were served a notice of hearing regarding Charles's emergency motion on
February 27, 2024, set for March 14, 2024.
Charles filed initial disclosures ten days before the hearing and filed a notice to the court
on March 4, 2024, explaining that he would not be leaving the family home until the
court heard his emergency motion, given the rights at stake. In response, Morgan took
matters into her own hands and illegally locked Charles out of the marital residence on
March 6, 2024, before the scheduled hearing could take place.
XI. THE MARCH HEARING AND DENIAL OF DUE PROCESS
At the March 14 hearing, Cooper L. Carter handed Charles formal temporary orders that
were based on the February 1st report drafted by Dan Bacalis. Despite filing no response
to his emergency motion, it was denied outright, and Charles was ordered to sign the
temporary orders prepared by Cooper L. Carter. When Charles refused to sign orders he
did not agree with, the judge rendered them anyway.
Following this setback, Charles prepared his Second Amended Preparatory Notice for
Judicial Review, which provided a detailed account of the facts of the matter, detailed
affidavits from business clients, and attorney-client interactions, as well as videos of
Charles with his children. Charles then began preparing to appeal to the Second Court of
Appeals for the extraordinary writ of mandamus.
XII. THE APPELLATE JOURNEY BEGINS
On April 4, 2024, Charles began his appellate journey by filing a petition for writ of
mandamus and emergency stay in the Second Court of Appeals. Both were denied just a
few days later. Charles moved for rehearing on his mandamus petition.
Meanwhile, Cooper L. Carter tried to set a pre-trial conference on April 24, 2024, which
Charles promptly objected to that same day. The following day, Charles's rehearing was

denied in the Second Court of Appeals, and he moved for rehearing en banc, which was
also denied. Undeterred, Charles petitioned the Texas Supreme Court on May 12, 2024.
The next action from Cooper L. Carter came via email correspondence on May 19, 2024,
when she requested an income withholding order from Charles, which was defective.
Charles notified her of the defects but never received a response.
XIII. INTERVENTION AND SUMMER WITH CHILDREN
While Charles awaited the Texas Supreme Court's decision, the Texas Office of the
Attorney General filed an intervention on June 28, 2024, for alleged past-due child
support. Charles promptly objected to this intervention on July 1, 2024, and nothing
further came of it.
Charles spent the remainder of July 2024 with his daughters, trying to find some form of
normalcy during this difficult time. He stayed with the children in an Airbnb less than
two miles from the marital residence to provide stability and comfort for the month.
XIV. CONTINUED LEGAL EFFORTS AND CHALLENGES
The Texas Supreme Court denied Charles's petition on August 30, 2024. Undeterred, he
moved for rehearing by September 10, 2024, and amended the petition six days later.
Given that Cooper L. Carter had been silent throughout the entire appellate process,
Charles moved to challenge her authority under Rule 12 of the Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure and served discovery requests in late September.
The discovery requested production of documents and admissions. By this time, Charles
had discovered that the orders currently in place were likely void for lack of consent, so
he filed an emergency motion for temporary orders requesting relief. The emergency
was based on his depleted credit and savings, which meant he would have to move out
of the area by October 1st if relief could not be granted.
When no relief came, Charles filed a joint motion to recuse both James Munford and Jeff
Kaitcer from the case. Both judges elected not to recuse themselves, and James Munford
had to amend his initial referral order due to procedural abnormalities involving the
court coordinator and tampering with documents. Charles's mandamus rehearing in the
Supreme Court of Texas was denied on October 18, 2024.
XV. RECUSAL PROCEEDINGS AND FEDERAL REMOVAL
The recusal proceedings were referred to Justice Lee Gabriel, a retired visiting judge
from the Second Court of Appeals. Charles filed a pre-trial motion in limine prior to the

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
hearing and requested confirmation that Justice Lee Gabriel had taken her required oath
prior to sitting on the case.
On the day of the scheduled hearing, November 7, 2024, Charles woke up with a dental
emergency and promptly notified the court and the opposing party, who agreed to reset
the recusal hearing to a later date. Nevertheless, Charles received a denial on his recusal
motion on November 17, 2024, which falsely claimed that he had failed to appear at the
hearing while the opposing side did appear.
Feeling that he had exhausted all state remedies and been treated unfairly at every turn,
Charles filed a notice of intent to remove the case to the Northern District of Texas. The
case was removed on December 4, 2024, but was quickly remanded by December 6,
2024.
XVI. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND CURRENT SITUATION
In early 2025, Charles continued his legal battle. On January 13, 2025, he filed a case
memo/plea for judicial review. On January 22, 2025, he filed a notice of loss of
employment, highlighting the devastating impact the legal proceedings had on his
ability to maintain his business without reliable internet access.
On February 10-12, 2025, Charles filed an emergency ex-parte motion for child custody,
sole use of the marital residence, contempt, and sanctions. He also filed a notice of past-
due findings of fact and conclusions of law, highlighting the court's failure to provide the
legal basis for its decisions.
On March 19, 2025, Charles opened a separate Suit Affecting Parent-Child Relationship
(SAPCR) seeking emergency relief after being locked out of his house for over a year with
no effective legal remedy. After remaining silent for over a year, Cooper L. Carter
suddenly reappeared to answer the suit and filed a motion to consolidate.
Charles responded with a motion to strike those pleadings because they were filed once
again by Roderick D. Marx, not Cooper L. Carter herself. Charles then objected to the
consolidation, trying to invoke a dominant jurisdiction analysis based on exceptions that
apply when a suit is not being prosecuted or was brought in bad faith.
Charles then filed an emergency Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and got as far as
setting the matter for a presentation on March 28, 2025. Without responding to the TRO,
Cooper requested to be "patched in" with the judge during the presentment.
On March 28, 2025, after the parties agreed to April 10th as a date for the full TRO
hearing, Charles was denied the opportunity to be heard. He was told to leave without
the court even hearing or ruling on his motion, based on a forward-looking promise

made by Cooper Carter that she would be filing a motion to consolidate in the first court
—a promise that wasn't fulfilled until a week later.
Charles filed a mandamus in the Second Court of Appeals seeking to compel the
associate judge in the second court to hear the SAPCR and void the orders issued on
March 14, 2024, in the divorce suit. On the same day, the second court granted Cooper's
motion sua sponte without a hearing and without notice. The mandamus was denied
per curiam the next day on April 11, 2025.
XVII. THE HUMAN TOLL
Throughout this ordeal, which has now stretched for more than 16 months, Charles has
been effectively separated from his home, his stable work environment, and the normal
parenting relationship he once enjoyed with his daughters. The financial strain has been
enormous—depleting his savings, damaging his credit, and undermining his business
that requires reliable internet access he no longer has.
The emotional toll has been equally devastating. Charles has gone from being a daily
presence in his daughters' lives—taking them to school, helping with homework, giving
baths, and being there for bedtime routines—to a marginalized figure fighting through a
labyrinthine legal system that seems designed to exhaust his resources and resolve.
Perhaps most troubling is the emerging evidence that Morgan is now engaged to Damen
Kazlauskas, the man with whom she exchanged thousands of text messages prior to
announcing her desire for divorce. This suggests that the entire legal campaign against
Charles may have been orchestrated not because of any legitimate concerns about
safety or family violence, but as a means to remove him from the home to facilitate a
new relationship—all at the expense of the children's stable environment and Charles's
fundamental rights as a father and homeowner.
Despite these challenges, Charles has persisted in his legal efforts, representing himself
pro se after his initial negative experience with legal counsel, filing appropriate motions
and appeals, and seeking relief through every available channel in the Texas legal
system. His story is not merely one of personal hardship but represents a troubling
example of how the family court system can be manipulated through false allegations
and procedural technicalities to produce profoundly unjust outcomes.

LEGAL ANALYSIS AND IMPLICATIONS
I. VIOLATIONS OF TEXAS FAMILY CODE SECTION 6.405(b)
One of the most significant legal issues in Charles Myers's case involves violations of
Texas Family Code Section 6.405(b), which establishes mandatory procedures when
family violence is alleged in divorce proceedings. This statute requires that when family
violence is alleged, the court must hold a hearing within 14 days to determine whether
to dissolve or modify any temporary ex parte protective order.
In Charles's case, Morgan claimed in her divorce petition filed on December 18, 2023,
that she had an active order of protection against Charles due to family violence. She
later filed an additional protective order application on December 22, 2023, claiming
family violence occurred on December 18, 2023. Despite these allegations, the court
failed to conduct the mandatory hearing within the 14-day timeframe required by
statute.
Instead, on January 16, 2024, without any evidence being presented, witnesses called,
or findings made, the court ordered Charles to vacate his family home. This action
violated not only the procedural requirements of Section 6.405(b) but also Charles's
fundamental due process rights. The court's failure to follow this mandatory procedure
constitutes reversible error and renders the resulting orders potentially void.
The implications of this violation extend beyond procedural technicalities. By failing to
hold the required hearing, the court effectively treated Morgan's unsubstantiated
allegations as established facts, depriving Charles of the opportunity to present
evidence contradicting these claims. This resulted in life-altering consequences for
Charles, including separation from his home, disruption of his business, and reduced
access to his children—all without the evidentiary foundation required by law.
II. FALSE ALLEGATIONS AND THEIR LEGAL CONSEQUENCES
The record strongly suggests that Morgan made false allegations of family violence to
gain tactical advantages in the divorce proceedings. Texas law recognizes the serious
nature of family violence allegations and imposes significant penalties for those who
perpetrate such violence. However, the law also provides remedies when allegations are
demonstrably false.
The evidence indicates that Morgan's claims of family violence were fabricated:
Charles's Texas Department of Public Safety records showed no history of violence.

gain tactical advantages in the divorce proceedings. Texas law recognizes the serious
nature of family violence allegations and imposes significant penalties for those who
perpetrate such violence. However, the law also provides remedies when allegations are
demonstrably false.

The evidence indicates that Morgan's claims of family violence were fabricated:

=== PAGE 226 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Morgan continued to cohabitate with Charles after filing for divorce and alleging
family violence.
No specific incidents of violence were ever detailed in Morgan's filings.
The timing of the allegations coincided with Charles's discovery of Morgan's
extensive communications with individuals outside the marriage.
Under Texas law, making false statements in court filings constitutes perjury, a criminal
offense. Additionally, Texas Family Code Section 153.013 provides for sanctions against a
party who files a suit affecting the parent-child relationship and makes false allegations
of child abuse. While this section specifically addresses child abuse allegations, courts
have applied similar reasoning to false allegations of domestic violence that impact
custody determinations.
The legal implications of these false allegations are profound. They formed the basis for
emergency orders that removed Charles from his home, influenced temporary custody
arrangements, and set in motion a chain of legal proceedings that have consumed more
than 16 months of litigation. The court's failure to scrutinize these allegations and
Morgan's apparent immunity from consequences for potentially false sworn statements
undermines the integrity of the judicial process.
III. ATTORNEY AUTHORITY ISSUES AND RULE 12 VIOLATIONS
A significant procedural irregularity in this case involves the representation of Morgan by
attorney Cooper L. Carter. According to the case materials, Cooper's filings were
submitted by Roderick D. Marx, who was not a named party in the lawsuit. This raises
serious questions about proper representation and may constitute unauthorized
practice of law.
Texas Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 12 provides a mechanism to challenge an attorney's
authority to represent a party. Charles appropriately filed a Rule 12 motion challenging
Cooper's authority, particularly questioning the propriety of having Roderick D. Marx file
documents on her behalf. Under Rule 12, once such a motion is filed, the burden shifts to
the challenged attorney to prove their authority to act. If the challenged attorney fails to
show sufficient authority, the court shall refuse to permit the attorney to appear in the
cause.
The record indicates that Charles's Rule 12 challenge was not properly addressed. This
procedural violation has significant implications:
If Cooper lacked proper authority to represent Morgan, all filings and orders
obtained through her representation could be void.

2. Morgan continued to cohabitate with Charles after filing for divorce and alleging
family violence.

3. No specific incidents of violence were ever detailed in Morgan's filings.

4. The timing of the allegations coincided with Charles's discovery of Morgan's
extensive communications with individuals outside the marriage.

Under Texas law, making false statements in court filings constitutes perjury, a criminal
offense. Additionally, Texas Family Code Section 153.013 provides for sanctions against a
party who files a suit affecting the parent-child relationship and makes false allegations
of child abuse. While this section specifically addresses child abuse allegations, courts
have applied similar reasoning to false allegations of domestic violence that impact
custody determinations.

The legal implications of these false allegations are profound. They formed the basis for
emergency orders that removed Charles from his home, influenced temporary custody
arrangements, and set in motion a chain of legal proceedings that have consumed more
than 16 months of litigation. The court's failure to scrutinize these allegations and
Morgan's apparent immunity from consequences for potentially false sworn statements
undermines the integrity of the judicial process.

Ill. ATTORNEY AUTHORITY ISSUES AND RULE 12 VIOLATIONS

A significant procedural irregularity in this case involves the representation of Morgan by
attorney Cooper L. Carter. According to the case materials, Cooper's filings were
submitted by Roderick D. Marx, who was not a named party in the lawsuit. This raises
serious questions about proper representation and may constitute unauthorized
practice of law.

Texas Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 12 provides a mechanism to challenge an attorney's
authority to represent a party. Charles appropriately filed a Rule 12 motion challenging
Cooper's authority, particularly questioning the propriety of having Roderick D. Marx file
documents on her behalf. Under Rule 12, once such a motion is filed, the burden shifts to
the challenged attorney to prove their authority to act. If the challenged attorney fails to
show sufficient authority, the court shall refuse to permit the attorney to appear in the
cause.

The record indicates that Charles's Rule 12 challenge was not properly addressed. This
procedural violation has significant implications:

1. If Cooper lacked proper authority to represent Morgan, all filings and orders
obtained through her representation could be void.

The electronic filing of documents by someone other than the attorney of record
violates Texas electronic filing requirements, which specify that attorneys must
maintain control and responsibility over their electronic filings.
The potential unauthorized practice of law, if non-attorneys were preparing and
filing legal documents, undermines the integrity of the legal proceedings.
These issues go beyond mere technicalities. They strike at the heart of proper legal
representation and the integrity of court filings. If an attorney can have others file
documents on their behalf without proper authorization, it circumvents the safeguards
built into the legal system to ensure accountability and proper representation.
IV. DUE PROCESS VIOLATIONS
Throughout the proceedings, Charles has experienced multiple violations of his due
process rights, which are guaranteed by both the Texas and United States Constitutions.
Due process requires notice and an opportunity to be heard before being deprived of
life, liberty, or property.
Specific due process violations in Charles's case include:
Removal from home without evidence or findings: On January 16, 2024, Charles
was ordered to vacate his family home without any evidence being presented,
witnesses called, or findings made. This constitutes a taking of property without
due process.
Denial of opportunity to present evidence: Charles's emergency motion filed on
February 8, 2024, which included substantial evidence contradicting Morgan's
claims, was denied outright on March 14, 2024, without proper consideration.
Orders rendered without consent: Despite Charles's refusal to sign the temporary
orders prepared by Cooper L. Carter on March 14, 2024, the judge rendered them
anyway, characterizing them as "agreed" orders when no such agreement existed.
Ex parte communications: The record suggests potential improper
communications between opposing counsel and judges, particularly when Cooper
L. Carter requested to be "patched in" with the judge during the TRO presentment
on March 28, 2025.
Denial of hearings: Charles was repeatedly denied the opportunity to present
evidence or be heard on his motions, most recently on March 28, 2025, when he
was told to leave without the court even hearing or ruling on his motion.
These due process violations have had cascading effects on Charles's ability to
effectively advocate for his rights and maintain his relationship with his children. When

courts issue orders without proper evidentiary foundation, deny parties the opportunity
to present evidence, or characterize orders as "agreed" when they are not, they
undermine the fundamental fairness that is the cornerstone of our legal system.
V. JURISDICTION ISSUES AND CONSOLIDATION PROBLEMS
The case presents significant issues related to jurisdiction and consolidation,
particularly in the context of the dominant jurisdiction doctrine in Texas. This doctrine
determines which court has priority when two courts have concurrent jurisdiction over
the same controversy.
When Charles opened a separate Suit Affecting Parent-Child Relationship (SAPCR) on
March 19, 2025, seeking emergency relief after being locked out of his house for over a
year, he was invoking exceptions to the dominant jurisdiction rule. These exceptions
apply when:
The suit in the first court is not being actively prosecuted, or
The suit was filed in bad faith or for the purpose of delay.
Both exceptions appear applicable in this case. The original divorce proceeding had seen
minimal activity from Morgan's side for extended periods, and the evidence suggests the
original suit may have been filed in bad faith, using false allegations to secure tactical
advantages.
Despite these valid jurisdictional arguments, the second court granted Cooper's motion
to consolidate sua sponte (on its own motion) without a hearing and without notice on
April 10, 2025. This action deprived Charles of the opportunity to argue the jurisdictional
issues and effectively nullified his attempt to seek relief through an alternative
procedural channel after exhausting remedies in the original proceeding.
The legal implications of these jurisdictional issues are significant. If a court lacks proper
jurisdiction or improperly consolidates cases without addressing valid jurisdictional
challenges, its orders may be void or voidable. The apparent disregard for proper
jurisdictional analysis in this case represents another layer of procedural irregularity that
has prevented Charles from obtaining meaningful review of his claims.
VI. APPELLATE REVIEW CHALLENGES
Charles has diligently pursued appellate remedies throughout this case, filing multiple
petitions for writs of mandamus to the Second Court of Appeals and the Texas Supreme
Court. Despite presenting substantial evidence of procedural irregularities and due
process violations, these petitions have been summarily denied without addressing the
merits of his claims.

=== PAGE 229 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The difficulty Charles has faced in obtaining meaningful appellate review highlights a
systemic issue in family law cases. Extraordinary writs like mandamus are often the only
available remedy for interim orders in family cases, as these orders are generally not
immediately appealable. However, the high standard for mandamus relief—requiring a
clear abuse of discretion and no adequate remedy by appeal—creates a significant
barrier for litigants seeking to correct procedural errors in family courts.
The repeated denial of Charles's mandamus petitions without substantive analysis of his
claims raises concerns about the effectiveness of appellate review in family law cases,
particularly those involving self-represented litigants. When appellate courts decline to
intervene despite evidence of procedural irregularities and due process violations, it
leaves litigants like Charles with no effective remedy for potentially void or voidable
orders that have life-altering consequences.
VII. BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILDREN CONSIDERATIONS
Throughout these proceedings, there appears to have been insufficient consideration of
the best interest of the children, which is the paramount concern in all suits affecting the
parent-child relationship under Texas Family Code Section 153.002.
The court's decisions have resulted in:
Disruption of the children's stable home environment by removing their father
from the family residence
Separation from a parent who was actively involved in their daily care and routines
Potential exposure to parental alienation
Instability created by Morgan's apparent relationship with Damen Kazlauskas,
which evidence suggests began before the divorce proceedings
The legal standard for best interest determinations in Texas was established in Holley v.
Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367 (Tex. 1976), which outlined factors courts should consider,
including the emotional and physical needs of the children, the stability of the home,
and the plans for the children by the individuals seeking custody.
The record suggests that these factors were not adequately considered in the court's
decisions. Charles's role as an active, involved father who took the children to school,
helped with homework, and provided daily care appears to have been disregarded in
favor of orders that separated him from his children based on unsubstantiated
allegations.
This failure to properly apply the best interest standard has significant legal
implications. Orders that do not properly consider the best interest of the children are
subject to modification and potentially reversal on appeal. More importantly, they may

unnecessarily disrupting their relationship with a loving parent.
VIII. CONCLUSION: THE NEED FOR HIGHER COURT INTERVENTION
The legal analysis of Charles Myers's case reveals a troubling pattern of procedural
irregularities, due process violations, and disregard for statutory requirements that have
resulted in substantial injustice. From the failure to hold mandatory hearings under
Texas Family Code Section 6.405(b) to the acceptance of potentially false allegations
without evidence, from questions about attorney authority to improper consolidation of
cases, the proceedings have been marked by deviations from proper legal procedure.
These issues are not merely technical violations but have resulted in profound
consequences for Charles and his children. He has been removed from his home,
separated from his children, and deprived of the stable environment necessary for his
business—all without the evidentiary foundation and procedural safeguards required by
law.
The case presents an opportunity for a higher court to address not only the specific
injustices suffered by Charles but also broader systemic issues in family court
proceedings:
The need for strict adherence to statutory requirements when family violence is
alleged
The importance of evidentiary hearings before issuing orders with life-altering
consequences
The proper application of the Rule 12 procedure for challenging attorney authority
The protection of due process rights for all parties in family law proceedings
The proper analysis of jurisdictional issues in related family cases
The paramount consideration of children's best interests in all custody
determinations
Intervention by a higher court is not only justified but necessary to prevent a continuing
miscarriage of justice and to affirm the principle that procedural safeguards are not
mere formalities but essential protections for the rights of all parties in our legal system.

LEGAL PRECEDENTS AND AUTHORITIES FOR CHARLES
MYERS CASE
Texas Family Code Section 6.405 - Protective Order and Related Orders
Texas Family Code Section 6.405 establishes requirements for disclosure of protective
orders in divorce proceedings:
Disclosure Requirements: The petition in a suit for dissolution of marriage must
state whether there is in effect:
A protective order under Title 4
A protective order under Subchapter A, Chapter 7B, Code of Criminal Procedure
An order for emergency protection under Article 17.292, Code of Criminal
Procedure
Or if an application for such an order is pending
Documentation Requirements: The petitioner must attach to the petition a copy
of each order in which a party was the applicant or victim and the other party was
the respondent. If a copy is not available at filing, the petition must state that a

False Allegations of Family Violence in Texas Divorce Cases
According to legal resources from The Fox Firm (Sarah Fox Law):
Motivations for False Allegations: Divorcing partners often make false allegations
against spouses to:
Obtain favorable child custody outcomes
Gain advantage in marital property settlements
Act as revenge to damage the other party's reputation
Consequences of Family Violence Allegations:
Family violence is a serious crime in Texas with severe penalties
Even without conviction, allegations damage social reputation
Penalties can range from jail sentences up to one year and/or fines to prison
sentences of 5-99 years and/or fines up to $10,000
Civil penalties can include protective orders and restitution payments
Defense Strategies Against False Allegations:
Highlighting unreliable testimony and inconsistencies
Self-defense claims where applicable
Demonstrating actions were unintentional
Seeking experienced legal counsel
Relevance to Charles's Case: Morgan appears to have made false allegations of
family violence to gain advantage in the divorce proceedings, particularly regarding
child custody and property division.
Texas Rules of Civil Procedure - Rule 12: Attorney to Show Authority

Relevance to Charles's Case: Charles challenged Cooper L. Carter's authority
pursuant to Rule 12, particularly questioning the propriety of having Roderick D.
Marx file documents on her behalf.
Electronic Filing Requirements for Texas Attorneys
Based on Texas court rules and procedures:
Personal Responsibility: Attorneys must maintain control and responsibility over
their electronic filings.
Proper Identification: Electronic filings must be made under the attorney's own
credentials, not those of another person.
Unauthorized Practice Concerns: Having non-attorneys or non-parties prepare
and file legal documents may constitute unauthorized practice of law.
Relevance to Charles's Case: Cooper L. Carter's filings were allegedly submitted
by Roderick D. Marx, who was not a named party in the lawsuit, raising questions
about proper representation.
Texas Family Code Section 6.405(b) - Hearing Requirements for Family
Violence Allegations
When family violence is alleged in a divorce suit:
Mandatory Hearing: The court must hold a hearing within 14 days to determine
whether to dissolve or modify any temporary ex parte protective order.
Due Process: This requirement ensures due process for the accused party.
Procedural Violation: Failure to follow this mandatory procedure constitutes a
violation that can be challenged.
Relevance to Charles's Case: The court appears to have failed to follow this
mandatory procedure after Morgan alleged family violence, instead ordering
Charles to vacate his residence without proper hearings.
Dominant Jurisdiction Analysis in Texas
The legal doctrine of dominant jurisdiction in Texas determines which court has priority
when two courts have concurrent jurisdiction:
First-Filed Rule: Generally, the first court to acquire jurisdiction has dominant
jurisdiction.

CONCLUSION AND PRAYER FOR RELIEF
The case of Charles Dustin Myers presents a troubling example of how procedural
irregularities, false allegations, and questionable legal maneuvers can result in
substantial injustice within the family court system. Over the course of more than 16
months, Charles has been subjected to a series of actions that have deprived him of his
home, limited his access to his children, and undermined his ability to maintain his
business—all without the evidentiary foundation and procedural safeguards required by
law.
The record reveals a pattern of conduct by Morgan Myers, with the assistance of her
stepfather Daniel Branthoover and attorney Cooper L. Carter, that appears designed to
circumvent proper legal procedures and secure tactical advantages through false
allegations and procedural maneuvering. From the false claims of family violence and
financial indigency to the questionable electronic filing practices and improper
consolidation of cases, the proceedings have been marked by deviations from proper
legal procedure that have had profound consequences for Charles and his children.
Most troubling is the court's apparent willingness to issue life-altering orders without
proper evidentiary hearings, to characterize orders as "agreed" when no such
agreement existed, and to deny Charles the opportunity to present evidence
contradicting Morgan's claims. These actions not only violate specific statutory
requirements, such as Texas Family Code Section 6.405(b), but also undermine the
fundamental principles of due process and fairness that are the cornerstone of our legal
system.
Despite Charles's diligent efforts to seek relief through proper legal channels—filing
appropriate motions, petitioning for writs of mandamus, and even attempting to invoke
federal jurisdiction—he has been repeatedly denied meaningful review of his claims.
This case thus raises important questions not only about the specific injustices suffered
by Charles but also about the effectiveness of appellate review in family law cases,
particularly for self-represented litigants.

In light of these considerations, we respectfully request that the higher court:
Review the procedural history of this case and address the violations of Texas
Family Code Section 6.405(b) and other statutory requirements.
Examine the due process violations that have occurred throughout the
proceedings, particularly the issuance of orders without proper evidentiary
hearings.
Address the questions regarding attorney authority and electronic filing practices
raised by Charles's Rule 12 motion.
Consider the jurisdictional issues and improper consolidation of cases that have
prevented Charles from obtaining meaningful review of his claims.
Evaluate whether the best interests of the children have been properly considered
in the court's decisions, particularly in light of Charles's role as an active, involved
father.
Provide appropriate relief to correct the injustices that have occurred, including
but not limited to:
Vacating orders issued without proper evidentiary foundation
Requiring proper hearings on the allegations of family violence
Addressing the false statements made in court filings
Ensuring that Charles has meaningful access to his children and the ability to
maintain his business
Intervention by a higher court is not only justified but necessary to prevent a continuing
miscarriage of justice and to affirm the principle that procedural safeguards are not
mere formalities but essential protections for the rights of all parties in our legal system.
Charles Myers's case presents an opportunity to address not only his specific situation
but also broader systemic issues that affect the integrity and fairness of family court
proceedings for all litigants.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
CHARLES MYERS appeared voluntarily to show cause why a protective order should 
not be entered against him, yet was immediately deprived of exclusive residence in his home 
and custody of his children without a proper evidentiary hearing or findings of fact supporting 
such drastic relief. This occurred on January 16, 2024. 
2. Second Appearance:
Despite efforts to present meritorious issues, proceedings were delayed, providing no
meaningful relief, and prolonging injury to familial and property rights due to Petitioner, 
MORGAN MYERS, retaining counsel minutes before the scheduled reset for January 22, 2024. 
Third Appearance: 
CHARLES MYERS was coerced into signing a purported "settlement agreement" 
under duress by his own attorney, without genuine consent, and under threat of further 
deprivation, leading to his termination and subsequent challenge of the proceedings. This 
occurred on February 1, 2024. 
Fourth Appearance: 
CHARLES MYERS appeared to challenge the fraudulent settlement; however, despite 
the lack of any opposition on record, relief was denied, and CHARLES MYERS was ordered to 
sign an agreement to which he never lawfully consented. This occurred on March 14, 2024.

iii. Procedural injuries and prejudice inflicted upon the parties’ minor child during the
Court’s delay and refusal to act, now culminating in physical injury to the child;
iv. Plea to the Jurisdiction pending, which deprives the Court of authority to proceed to
any final trial setting without proper adjudication;

II. ISSUE
There are two significant procedural errors that must be immediately addressed. 
First, Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure does not authorize or delegate any 
responsibility for handling recusal matters to the court coordinator. Despite an explicit and timely 
objection to the coordinator's involvement outlined within the pending recusal motion itself, the 
coordinator continues to improperly manage and influence the referral process. This 
unauthorized participation represents a fundamental procedural violation that undermines the 
neutrality and integrity of the recusal proceedings. 
Second, the involvement of Hon. Jeffrey Kaitcer in the current referral is entirely 
improper and unnecessary, as the current motion for recusal specifically and explicitly names 
only Hon. James Munford as the respondent judge. While the current motion does reference a 
prior joint recusal motion historically—where Hon. Kaitcer was previously named—that 
reference is strictly contextual and does not constitute a renewed or active request for his recusal 
at this juncture. The plain language and explicit identification in the current motion leave no 
reasonable ambiguity that the recusal sought at present involves only Judge Munford. Therefore, 
Judge Kaitcer’s unilateral decision to decline recusal and issue a referral, despite no pending 
recusal against him, is procedurally incorrect and strongly suggests the motion itself was not 
reviewed substantively before action was taken. 
These procedural missteps—the continued improper involvement of the court coordinator 
and the erroneous implication of a second judge—constitute clear violations of Rule 18a, 
compromise the impartiality required by judicial ethics, and further evidence that due diligence 
was not exercised in considering the motion as filed.

III. APPLICATION OF LAW
A trial court has no discretion in determining what the law is or applying the law to the 
facts even when the law is unsettled. In re Prudential, 148 S.W.3d at 135. Consequently, a clear 
failure by the trial court to analyze or apply the law correctly will constitute an abuse of 
discretion. Walker v Packer, 827 S.W.2d at 840 (Tex.1992). Here, the continuous disregard for 
the undersigned’s pleadings, the Texas Constitution, the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and the 
Texas Family Code has resulted in cumulative and severe harm: a minor child has sustained 
preventable injury due solely to judicial inaction; the Petitioner continues to evade adjudication 
despite credible, unrefuted, and well-documented allegations of fraud; and opposing counsel—
who has never substantively responded to any pleading nor demonstrated her authority to act 
pursuant to Rule 12—continues to receive judicial favor, undermining fundamental due process 
protections. This persistent tolerance for procedural irregularities denies the undersigned equal 
protection under law and creates a significant risk of ongoing and future delays, as every action 
undertaken by this unauthorized attorney remains vulnerable to being stricken or invalidated. 
Consequently, the judicial process has become one that incentivizes silence, penalizes diligence, 
and leaves vulnerable children exposed to avoidable and foreseeable harm. Moreover, this 
conduct demonstrates an unacceptable level of bias: a judge who was never implicated in the 
present recusal motion has inexplicably involved himself without justification, the court 
coordinator improperly continues to perform roles for which she has no lawful authority, and 
Texas law is repeatedly misapplied, consistently to the detriment of the undersigned and his 
children. This troubling pattern of behavior erodes public trust, compromises judicial integrity, 
and necessitates immediate corrective action.

IV. CONCLUSION
The issues necessitating this recusal are precisely the errors and procedural misconduct 
outlined herein. The Court has repeatedly issued perfunctory orders lacking any substantive legal 
explanation, mirroring the persistent silence and inaction of the opposing counsel. No valid legal 
justification has been offered to explain the sustained disregard for the Texas Rules of Civil 
Procedure, the Texas Family Code, and fundamental principles of due process. The undersigned 
respectfully reiterates that this is a Family Law proceeding—one that profoundly impacts 
children and families—not a venue for procedural indifference or selective enforcement. At a 
minimum, the Court must adhere strictly and impartially to the established rules and procedural 
requirements. Unless and until there is clear evidence that the pending Motion to Recuse has 
been properly and substantively reviewed and considered, the undersigned expressly objects to 
any scheduling of further hearings or proceedings in this matter. This objection is filed not out of 
disrespect, but rather out of necessity and urgency, to document and bring attention to continued 
procedural irregularities and judicial oversights that have compromised the fairness and integrity 
of this case. The undersigned seeks only the due process and equal protection to which all 
litigants are entitled, and which the record thus far has conspicuously failed to reflect.

322nd District Court, based upon grounds detailed therein and pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil 
Procedure 18b. 
2. Crucially, the Amended Recusal Motion filed on April 28, 2025, named only the
Honorable James Munford as the judge whose recusal was sought. It did not seek the recusal of 
the Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer. 
3. Prior to the issuance of the Order of Assignment, on April 29, 2025, Respondent filed
an "OBJECTION – RECUSAL PROCEDURE." Exhibit A. This objection explicitly brought to 
the attention of the Eighth Administrative Judicial Region that, among other procedural 
irregularities, the Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer was being improperly implicated in recusal 
proceedings related to the Amended Recusal Motion, as said motion did not name him. The 
objection highlighted that any action by Judge Kaitcer concerning the Amended Recusal Motion 
(which did not seek his recusal) was procedurally incorrect and suggested that the motion itself 
had not been substantively reviewed before such erroneous actions were taken. 
4. Subsequently, on May 6, 2025, the Presiding Judge of the Eighth Administrative
Judicial Region issued the Order of Assignment. This Order assigns the Honorable John H. 
Cayce to preside in and rule on: 
i. "the Motion to Recuse the Honorable James Munford and the Honorable Jeffrey
Kaitcer filed by Charles Dustin Myers on April 25, 2025" and 
ii. "the First Amended Motion to Recuse the Honorable James Munford and the
Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer filed on April 28, 2025." – Exhibit B 
5. Despite Respondent’s objections, the Court Coordinator for the 322nd District Court
has continued to be involved in the administrative handling and communication regarding these 
recusal proceedings.

II. ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES
The Order of Assignment dated May 6, 2025, is procedurally defective and based on a 
fundamental mischaracterization of the pending Amended Recusal Motion, particularly as it 
pertains to the Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer. 
1. Mischaracterization of the Operative Pleading
The Order of Assignment incorrectly states that the "First Amended Motion to Recuse... 
filed on April 28, 2025" sought the recusal of both Judge Munford and Judge Kaitcer. This is 
factually incorrect. The Amended Recusal Motion filed by Respondent on that date sought only 
the recusal of Judge Munford. 
2. Violation of TRCP 18a Requirements
i. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(a) governs the filing of a motion to recuse. It
requires that such a motion "must be verified and must state with particularity the grounds why 
the judge should be recused or disqualified and the specific provision of Rule 18b or other law 
relied on." 
ii. A motion to recuse is specific to the judge whose recusal is sought. If the Amended
Recusal Motion did not name Judge Kaitcer, then there was no valid, pending motion seeking 
Judge Kaitcer’s recusal before the Presiding Judge of the Administrative Judicial Region upon 
which an assignment could be based. 
iii. Under TRCP 18a(f)(1), it is the "respondent judge" (the judge whose recusal is sought
in a filed motion) who must either recuse or refer the motion. If Judge Kaitcer was not the 
respondent judge in the Amended Recusal Motion, he had no authority to take any action 
regarding that specific motion. 
iv. Consequently, any referral or assignment based on the premise that the Amended
Recusal Motion targeted Judge Kaitcer is without proper foundation under TRCP 18a.

3. Improper Involvement of Court Coordinator in Recusal Process
i. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a meticulously details the procedural steps for recusal
and disqualification of judges. TRCP 18a(e) specifically assigns duties related to the handling 
and delivery of recusal motions, responses, and orders of recusal or referral to the **"clerk of the 
court." 
ii. TRCP 18a(e)(1) states: "When a motion or response is filed, the **clerk of the court**
must immediately deliver a copy to the respondent judge and to the presiding judge of the 
administrative judicial region..." 
iii. TRCP 18a(e)(2) states: "When a respondent judge signs and files an order of recusal
or referral, the **clerk of the court** must immediately deliver a copy to the regional presiding 
judge." 
iv. Significantly, TRCP Rule 18a makes no mention of the "court coordinator" and assigns
no duties, responsibilities, or authority to a court coordinator in the recusal or disqualification 
process. The rule is explicit in its assignment of these administrative tasks to the "clerk of the 
court." 
v. The legal principle of expressio unius est exclusio alterius (the express mention of one
thing excludes all others) suggests that where a procedural rule details the roles of specific court 
personnel (the clerk) and omits others (the court coordinator), the omitted personnel do not have 
an official, mandated role in that specific process under that rule. 
vi. The continued handling of any aspect of this recusal proceeding by the Court
Coordinator, particularly after Respondent has objected to such involvement, is therefore outside 
the procedural framework established by TRCP 18a and is improper. Such actions usurp the

3. Improper Involvement of Court Coordinator in Recusal Process

i. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a meticulously details the procedural steps for recusal
and disqualification of judges. TRCP 18a(e) specifically assigns duties related to the handling
and delivery of recusal motions, responses, and orders of recusal or referral to the **"clerk of the
court."

i. TRCP 18a(e)(1) states: "When a motion or response is filed, the **clerk of the court**
must immediately deliver a copy to the respondent judge and to the presiding judge of the
administrative judicial region..."

iii. TRCP 18a(e)(2) states: "When a respondent judge signs and files an order of recusal
or referral, the **clerk of the court** must immediately deliver a copy to the regional presiding
judge."

iv. Significantly, TRCP Rule 18a makes no mention of the "court coordinator" and assigns
no duties, responsibilities, or authority to a court coordinator in the recusal or disqualification
process. The rule is explicit in its assignment of these administrative tasks to the "clerk of the
court."

v. The legal principle of expressio unius est exclusio alterius (the express mention of one

personnel (the clerk) and omits others (the court coordinator), the omitted personnel do not have

an official, mandated role in that specific process under that rule.

5 
duties explicitly assigned to the clerk of the court and can compromise the neutrality and 
integrity of the recusal process. 
4. Prior Objection Put Region on Notice
The "OBJECTION – RECUSAL PROCEDURE" filed by Respondent on April 29, 2025, 
explicitly notified the Administrative Region of the error regarding Judge Kaitcer’s involvement 
before the Order of Assignment was issued. The subsequent issuance of the Order of Assignment, 
which perpetuates this error by incorrectly including Judge Kaitcer as a subject of the Amended 
Recusal Motion, demonstrates that the prior objection and the contents of the Amended Recusal 
Motion itself may not have been fully considered. This failure to address a clearly articulated 
procedural defect undermines the integrity and due process of the recusal procedure outlined in 
TRCP 18a. 
5. Prejudice to Respondent
Proceeding based on the current Order of Assignment would require Respondent to 
address recusal issues concerning Judge Kaitcer that were not raised in the operative Amended 
Recusal Motion, thereby misdirecting judicial resources and prejudicing Respondent by forcing 
litigation on a non-existent claim within that specific pleading. 
III. RELIEF REQUESTED
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Respondent Charles Dustin Myers 
respectfully requests that the Honorable David L. Evans, Presiding Judge of the Eighth 
Administrative Judicial Region: 
1. VACATE or AMEND the Order of Assignment dated May 6, 2025, to correctly reflect
that the "First Amended Motion to Recuse" filed on April 28, 2025, seeks only the recusal 
of the Honorable James Munford;
