further loss of rights, restore financial and parental stability to the children, and will 
uphold this State’s policy regarding pursuant to 153.002 of the Family Code. 
IV. REASONS TO STAY PROCEEDINGS 
1. Issuing a stay will prevent further errors from occurring below 
In the Second Court of Appeals and in the consolidated mandamus record 
attached to the Amended Motion to Consolidate before this Court, the Relator 
referred to these proceedings as the “Dragon in Triplicate”, which referred to the 
case as a procedural hydra that would continue to spawn additional heads if not 
dealt with as a whole, much akin to the mythical hydra depicted in Greek 
Mythology. On May 19, 2025, the instant matter was filed before this Court 
seeking to preserve the integrity of the recusal process, and an additional error 
threatens to spawn a fifth petition if these proceedings are not stayed absent a 
compelling reason to the contrary or legal justification for the mounting issues at 
hand. 
The Relator respectfully reminds the Court that the most recent filed 
mandamus raised two issues: 
1. That overruling an objection to the involvement of the court 
coordinator in the recusal process conflicts with the provisions of 
Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. (CR. 2744, p. 
2785)

2. That the order of assignment issued on May 6, 2025, is 
procedurally defective (CR. 2738, p. 2419) and is based on a 
fundamental mischaracterization of the Recusal Motion, 
particularly as it pertains to the Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer. (CR. 
2743, p. 2784) 
Shortly after filing the current mandamus petition docketed under cause 
number 25-0426 naming Honorable David L. Evans as the Respondent, the 
Recusal proceedings the Relator sought to preserve in accordance with the rules of 
procedure was abruptly ruled on by the assigned Judge, Honorable John H. Cayce 
Jr., and the reasons given for this denial strike at the very heart of the core 
arguments raised by the Relator. 
In this denial, it states: 
“After reviewing the motion and amended motion, I find that the motion and 
amended motion are based solely on the judge's rulings in the case under Tex. R. 
Civ. P. 18a (a) (3), and, even assuming they are not, the motions fail to state with 
detail and particularity facts that are within the affiant's personal knowledge, or on 
information and belief, that would be admissible in evidence and that, if proven, 
would be sufficient to justify recusal of Judge Munford on any ground specified in 
Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b (b), as required by Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a (a)(4).” Exhibit A

What the trial court below continues to overlook is the pattern of bias 
exhibited throughout these proceedings. Even here, this order gives the appearance 
of fair adjudication, but when examining the broader scope of this case, this order 
only adds to a layer of unexplained actions that can’t be attributed to the record 
before it and cannot be lawfully explained through common law or statutory law.  
 
If we turn and look at the manner in which these recusal proceedings were

1. The first recusal proceedings were initiated on October 7, 2025, and were 
processed through the court coordinator. The record reflects that the 
initial referral order “…provides no indication that the exhibits were filed 
alongside the motion, particularly the affidavit, which is referenced in the 
table of contents.” (CR. 1231, 1272). This raised a reasonable procedural 
question as to whether the Regional Presiding Judge received a complete 
version of the filing.

table of contents to begin on page 18 of the motion. (CR. 1200, p. 1241)  
3. The motion that the Relator filed with the clerk of the court ended on 
page 20 (CR. 1191, p. 1235) but still contained the same automated 
certificate of service.  
4. This prompted an Amended Order of Referral, where the file was split 
into three parts “[d]ue to the length of the Joint Motion of Recusal”. (CR. 
1233, p. 1274). The length of the motion originally filed was 150 pages 
long and 19.7mb in file size. 
5. The split motion was only delivered via email by the court coordinator, 
and to the Relator’s knowledge it has not been officially entered into the 
record. (CR. 1234, p. 1275) The combined file sizes delivered equal 
7,778 kilobytes which is roughly 7.59 megabytes, less than half of the 
size of the originally submitted document. 
B. Recusal #2 –Motion to Recuse Hon. James Munford (CR. 2463-2584, p. 
2504-2625) 
 
1. The second recusal proceedings began on April 28, 2025, and were again

2. This time, no motion was attached to either correspondence forwarded to 
the Regional Presiding Judge, and the Motion unambiguously sought the 
recusal of Hon. James Munford and made no mention seeking the 
Recusal of Hon. Jeff Kaitcer. 
3. These errors prompted an objection which raised two major issues in the 
procedural handling of the process, which were 1) “the coordinator 
continues to improperly manage and influence the referral process”, and  
2) “…the current motion for recusal specifically and explicitly names 
only Hon. James Munford as the respondent judge.” (CR. 2597, p. 2638) 
4. The order of assignment of Hon. John H. Cayce Jr. on May 6, 2025, still 
incorrectly referenced a non-existent motion to recuse involving Hon. 
Kaitcer, leading to a second objection that re-stated the issues raised in 
the first objection. (CR. 2742, p. 2783) 
The differences between how the recusal procedures were handled in the first 
proceedings versus the second proceedings raises several questions about the 
integrity of the process. The procedural posture of this matter will almost certainly 
create future issues that will act as further barriers to relief.  These statements are 
not mere guesses or assumptions – but these are substantiated claims that present 
themselves by review of the record. If the recusal process itself isn’t conducted in

motions that were never filed. Exhibit B 
2. Issuing a stay will prevent ongoing and irreparable harm 
 
As of today, May 20, 2025, the Relator exists in the local Library, spending 
his days studying, as the date in which he requested emergency relief in the 25-
0361 case has lapsed, and the temporary housing arrangements available to him 
have expired. This means that despite being a fit parent subjected to the 
circumstances of these matters, he no longer has a place to offer his children a 
somewhat stable environment during the pendency of these matters, and their 
relationship will continue to deteriorate at an even faster rate. These are not merely 
claims at this juncture, and the recusal proceedings give us insight into a crucial 
overlap that gives credibility to the issues raised in case number 25-0361. 
 
In both recusal proceedings, the Honorable Judges each stated that they 
would “take no further action” pending the determination of the motion by the 
Regional Presiding Judge. (CR. 2586, p. 2627, CR. 2591, p. 2632). This language 
is consistent with Rule 18a(f)(2)(A), which states that: 
“[i]f a motion is filed before evidence has been offered at trial, the 
respondent judge must take no further action in the case until the 
motion has been decided, except for good cause stated in writing or on 
the record.”

The invocation of this rule directly contradicts the temporary orders issued 
on March 26, 2024, signed by only the opposing party on March 14, 2024, which 
states the following on page 1 of the orders: 
“The Court, after examining the record and the agreement of the 
parties and hearing the evidence and argument of counsel, finds that 
all necessary prerequisites of the law have been legally satisfied and 
that the Court has jurisdiction of this case and of all the parties.“ (CR. 
863, p. 904) 
 
By agreeing to take no further action in the case, Hon. Kaitcer agrees with 
the Relator’s claim that the court never heard any evidence which has been 
repeated numerous times throughout the case. (CR. 123, p. 164) (CR. 146, p. 187) 
(CR. 223, p. 264) (CR. 739, p. 780) (CR. 763, p. 804) (CR. 933, p. 974) (CR. 1315,

p. 2109) (CR. 2167, p. 2208) (CR. 2169, p. 2210) (CR. 2617, p. 2658). Issuing a 
stay would suspend these orders, end the irreparable harm, restore the Relator’s 
fundamental rights, and would serve the best interests of his children.

stripped the children of their relationship with their father, have rendered the 
Relator homeless and unable to provide a stable environment, and have had chaos 
introduced into their daily lives. These claims have been repeatedly stated 
throughout this matter, and neither the opposing party nor the tribunal has raised 
any rebuttal or reason supporting the current situation. Issuing this emergency stay 
would restore these fundamental rights and realign the case with the State’s policy 
pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code 153.001. 
V. CONCLUSION 
 
With four Honorable Respondent judges named across four concurrent 
mandamus petitions now pending before this Honorable Court, no response or 
opposition has yet been provided. The Relator continues to seek redress—alone—
amid a sustained and procedurally irregular situation that has no foundation in 
Texas law. Absent timely intervention, the pattern of error will persist, irreparable 
harm will deepen, and public confidence in the judicial process will further erode. 
The Relator has not lost confidence in this process, which is why he persists. There 
is only one solution to this matter: provide the un-opposed relief that at a minimum 
creates no risk of harm to any party, restores the Relator’s fundamental rights, 
vindicates his efforts, and most importantly is the lawfully accurate decision to 
make given the totality of circumstances now fully before this Court.

ORDER SUMMARILY DENYING MOTION FOR RECUSAL 
Before me is an Order of Referral from the Honorable James B. Munford signed April 29, 
2025, referring a Motion to Recuse and First Amended Motion to Recuse filed by Charles Dustin 
Myers in the above-referenced matter. 
After reviewing the motion and amended motion, I find that the motion and amended 
motion are based solely on the judge's rulings in the case under Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a (a) (3), and, 
even assuming they are not, the motions fail to state with detail and particularity facts that are 
within the affiant's personal knowledge, or on information and belief, that would be admissible in 
evidence and that, if proven, would be sufficient to justify recusal of Judge Munford on any ground 
specified in Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b (b), as required by Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a (a)(4). 
THEREFORE, having concluded that the motion and amended motion seeking to recuse 
Judge Munford fail to comply with Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a (a), I summarily deny the motions in this 
matter, without a hearing, pursuant to Tex. R. Civ.
