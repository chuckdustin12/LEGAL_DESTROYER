Again, all of these points have been argued in both courts, and it is her duty as counsel to handle these matters in
accordance with Texas Law.
These matters should be handled between the parties - not attempt to influence court staff after hours.
The reason we are here in the first place is due to the above unanswered facts. Ms. Carter has had ample time to file an
objection, response, or counter argument, but has chosen not to do so.
It would've been far more appropriate for Ms. Carter to have reached out to me directly to discuss scheduling conflicts.
Prior to the latest email, there was no indication Ms. Carter intended to participate at all despite being provided with all
relevant materials.
The court should disregard this email correspondence in its entirety for the reasons stated herein as it is highly prejudicial
to Petitioner and the children.
Pro se litigants are expected to follow the rules of procedure to the same extent licensed attorneys are.
This email chain should be disregarded in its entirety.
Have a good evening.
Respectfully,
Charles Dustin Myers
Petitioner, Pro Se

Good morning,
Mr. Myers appeared before me to schedule the hearing for the TRO; my apologies I did not realize this was that
same case.  We can go ahead and set the TRO with us, but most likely the case will be transferred prior to the
hearing date and the case needs to be transferred prior to that date.
Mr. Myers will be emailing with dates available for the hearing.
Thank you,

Additionally, since there is an objection to the consolidation, y’all will need to reach out to request how to proceed
with the 322nd as I am usure of their procedures.
