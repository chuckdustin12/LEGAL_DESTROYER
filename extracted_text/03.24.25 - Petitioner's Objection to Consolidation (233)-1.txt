IN THE 233RD DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
1. Texas law does generally require consolidation of divorce and custody matters to 
avoid conflicting parallel litigation. Under Family Code § 6.407, if a SAPCR involving the child 
is already pending in one court when a divorce is filed in another court, the SAPCR must be 
transferred to the divorce court so that one judge handles everything. Likewise, if the parents 
are in the middle of a divorce, any new custody suit typically should be joined into that divorce 
case instead of proceeding separately. The policy behind this is to have one court speak on all 
parent-child issues at a time, preventing inconsistent orders. In a normal scenario, if Parent A 
filed for divorce (including child custody) in Court X, Parent B would not be allowed to file a 
separate SAPCR in Court Y at the same time – the law would mandate that the child’s case be 
heard in the first-filed divorce court. 
2. So, generally, an active divorce case would mean any custody claims belong in that 
lawsuit, not in a new, independent suit elsewhere.

INTRODUCTION

1. Texas law does generally require consolidation of divorce and custody matters to
avoid conflicting parallel litigation. Under Family Code § 6.407, if a SAPCR involving the child
is already pending in one court when a divorce is filed in another court, the SAPCR must be
transferred to the divorce court so that one judge handles everything. Likewise, if the parents
are in the middle of a divorce, any new custody suit typically should be joined into that divorce
case instead of proceeding separately. The policy behind this is to have one court speak on all
parent-child issues at a time, preventing inconsistent orders. In a normal scenario, if Parent A
filed for divorce (including child custody) in Court X, Parent B would not be allowed to file a
separate SAPCR in Court Y at the same time — the law would mandate that the child’s case be

heard in the first-filed divorce court.

2. So, generally, an active divorce case would mean any custody claims belong in that

lawsuit, not in a new, independent suit elsewhere.

3. However, § 6.407 assumes the initial divorce suit is properly filed and being pursued. 
Its joinder and transfer rules are meant to coordinate valid, concurrent proceedings. It does not 
explicitly address a situation where the original divorce/SAPCR is essentially a sham or has 
stalled out. In your case, while technically the divorce case exists, it was filed in bad faith and 
has produced no valid orders or final judgment. This puts it outside the typical scenario § 6.407 
contemplates. If the original case is on track to be dismissed or is proven to be jurisdictionally 
defective, there may soon be no “pending” case to join into. Thus, the usual mandatory joinder 
rule may not pose a long-term barrier, especially if you move to dismiss the old case for lack of 
prosecution. In short, ordinarily you must litigate child issues in the divorce suit, but when 
that suit is effectively defunct or void, the rationale for mandatory joinder falls away. 
II. Dominant Jurisdiction and Exceptions for Bad-Faith First Filings 
4. Even when no final order exists, Texas follows a “first in time” rule for parallel cases: 
the court where a suit is first filed generally has dominant jurisdiction, meaning it has the 
primary right to proceed, and any later-filed suit involving the same parties and issues should be 
abated (paused) or dismissed. Applied here, because the divorce case was filed earlier, a new 
SAPCR in another court would normally face a plea in abatement from the first filer. The second 
court would typically defer to the first-filed court’s authority over the matter. But importantly, 
Texas law also recognizes exceptions to the first-filed rule in cases of inequitable conduct. If the 
person who filed the first suit did so merely to gain an upper hand (for example, to lock in a 
preferred venue or harass the other parent) without any genuine intent to prosecute the case, 
that behavior can estop (prevent) them from claiming the benefits of dominant jurisdiction. 
5. Here, this is precisely what has occurred. COOPER L. CARTER, attorney for 
Respondent, has not prosecuted the first-filed case in over eight months. Her authority remains

in question under rule 12 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and hasn’t filed the mandatory 
notice of remand after federal removal, which occurred back in December of 2024. This 
procedurally prevents the case from moving forward until this requirement is met, which has not 
only been pointed out to Ms. Carter, but has been wholly disregarded. 
6. Now, Ms. Carter is before this court seeking to consolidate the SAPCR suit filed and 
captioned above back into the original suit in which she has not been prosecuting. Such action 
would further prejudice the children, and Ms. Carter should have to explain why she has failed to 
prosecute the main case, but yet can show up here and request consolidation. If Ms. Carter were 
genuinely looking to uphold the best interests of the children in this case, she wouldn’t allow 
their well-being to hang in the balance within the originally filed case – but she has been – which 
is why this SAPCR was brought before this court.  
7. Further, The Texas Supreme Court in Curtis v. Gibbs explained that a first filer’s bad 
faith or fraud can remove the shield of the first-filed rule and allow a later suit to go forward. 
This also applies here. Ms. Carter’s client initiated the divorce action in bad faith, and waived the 
60-day waiting period for divorce claiming an active order of protection was in effect against the 
undersigned. This was elected for the sole purpose of gaining an unfair advantage in the divorce 
proceedings. Once this advantage was gained, she stopped prosecuting the suit. 
8. Generally, if Suit 1 was essentially a placeholder or manipulation (filed “merely to 
obtain priority, without a bona fide intention to prosecute the suit” and the filer’s conduct kept 
Suit 2 from being filed sooner, a court can find that Suit 1 was an inequitable sham. In that event, 
the second court may deny the plea in abatement and take the case, effectively jumping past 
the first court. Id. Here, the facts suggest the prior divorce action was in bad faith and then 
abandoned – precisely the kind of scenario in which Texas courts allow an exception to the

“first-filed” rule. The Respondent in this matter had no serious intent to pursue the 
divorce/SAPCR (e.g. they filed to harass or to get temporary orders, then let the case languish), 
giving this court the discretion to refuse to abate/consolidate this SAPCR. The first court’s 
dominant jurisdiction dissolves if the first suit was a null effort. Therefore, given the 
circumstances, the opposing counsel should have to explain the reasoning behind her failure to 
prosecute before consolidation ordered under the assertion that it is “mandatory”. 
III. Filing a New SAPCR in a Different Court Under These Circumstances 
9. Given the above, nothing in Texas law absolutely bars the undersigned from filing 
a new SAPCR for his children in this court, because the original case truly produced no final 
orders and is effectively moribund. Texas Family Code § 155.001(d) explicitly provides that if no 
final order has been rendered in a SAPCR, any subsequent suit regarding the child is simply 
treated as a new original proceeding. 
9. That means the undersigned legally permitted to start fresh with a new custody suit 
because the first case never culminated in a final judgment. Additionally, the Texas Supreme 
Court has described a subsequent SAPCR in these circumstances as “a new suit in which no 
court has continuing exclusive jurisdiction”. Curtis v. Gibbs, 511 S.W.2d 263, 267 (Tex. 1974) 
(orig. proceeding) - confirming that a pending-but-unresolved prior case does not freeze the 
undersigned out of seeking relief from this court on behalf of his children. 
IV. The Old Case Faces Statutory Dismissal for Failure to Prosecute 
 
10. Interestingly, the first case has already had a motion to dismiss for want of 
prosecution filed. Unfortunately, due to Ms. Carter’s inability to prosecute the case, it remains in 
procedural limbo never properly remanded from federal court. So even if the cases were

“first-filed” rule. The Respondent in this matter had no serious intent to pursue the

giving this court the discretion to refuse to abate/consolidate this SAPCR. The first court’s

orders and is effectively moribund. Texas Family Code § 155.001(d) explicitly provides that if no
final order has been rendered in a SAPCR, any subsequent suit regarding the child is simply

treated as a new original proceeding.

9. That means the undersigned legally permitted to start fresh with a new custody suit
because the first case never culminated in a final judgment. Additionally, the Texas Supreme
Court has described a subsequent SAPCR in these circumstances as “a new suit in which no
court has continuing exclusive jurisdiction”. Curtis v. Gibbs, 511 S.W.2d 263, 267 (Tex. 1974)

undersigned out of seeking relief from this court on behalf of his children.

procedural limbo never properly remanded from federal court. So even if the cases were

consolidated, she would have no ability to proceed with the litigation, effectively putting this 
scenario back in the same spot, which would be prejudicial to the children. 
 
11. Under the Curtis v. Gibbs line of cases, the new court has authority to determine if the 
first filer’s conduct was inequitable. The Petitioner in this matter has not received any counter 
argument or denial regarding the claims of the Respondent’s inequitable conduct, only 
continuous attempts to subvert justice for the children named in this suit. 
 
12. The key point is that no “continuing, exclusive” jurisdiction binds the 
undersigned or the children to the old case, and an abandoned/invalid suit should not 
prevent a parent from protecting their child’s interests in a new forum. The law intends for 
one court at a time to handle a child’s case, but it does not reward a party who tried to game the 
system by filing first and then dropping the ball. The undersigned has proceeded diligently and 
transparently in the new SAPCR, and Texas law provides a path for him to do so. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
13. Because the prior divorce/SAPCR never resulted in a valid final order (and its only 
interim orders are void), that court never obtained continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the 
children. In the INTEREST OF A.F., W.J., A.J., and J.J., Children No. 02-19-00117-CV. A parent 
in this situation is generally free to initiate a new SAPCR as an original proceeding in the 
appropriate court. TEX. FAM. CODE 155.001(b)(2). While Texas law usually tries to funnel all 
custody matters into one court, it will not force you to remain tethered to a lawsuit that was filed 
in bad faith and then abandoned. The doctrines of continuing exclusive jurisdiction and 
mandatory joinder do not bar a new suit when the original case is effectively a nullity. Here, 
that is precisely the case, and until these points are rebutted by the opposing party, they prevail.

13. Because the prior divorce/SAPCR never resulted in a valid final order (and its only
