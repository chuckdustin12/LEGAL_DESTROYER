1. If this Honorable Court declines to address these mandamus petitions on 
rehearing, it would not merely miss a critical opportunity to resolve ongoing 
procedural failures and systemic issues in the lower courts, but also risk 
compounding harm by leaving the parties in indefinite legal limbo. This is 
especially troubling where the Relator – a pro se litigant – has demonstrated 
greater diligence and legal acumen than the licensed attorneys involved. Continued 
silence from the judiciary in the face of repeated, unaddressed mandamus filings 
undermines public confidence, perpetuates injustice, and forfeits a valuable chance 
to improve the treatment of pro se litigants in Texas courts.

inaction, and a lack of meaningful opposition or engagement from the real party in

confidence, perpetuates injustice, and forfeits a valuable chance to study and
improve the treatment of parents in Texas courts.

Relator respectfully submits this motion for rehearing regarding cause
number 25-0458, and incorporates the rehearing motions filed in 25-0361, 25-
0367, 25-0378, and 25-0426 by reference. In support of this motion for rehearing,
the Relator shows this court the following:

I. Introduction

1. If this Honorable Court declines to address these mandamus petitions on
rehearing, it would not merely miss a critical opportunity to resolve ongoing
procedural failures and systemic issues in the lower courts, but also risk
compounding harm by leaving the parties in indefinite legal limbo. This is
especially troubling where the Relator — a pro se litigant — has demonstrated
greater diligence and legal acumen than the licensed attorneys involved. Continued
silence from the judiciary in the face of repeated, unaddressed mandamus filings
undermines public confidence, perpetuates injustice, and forfeits a valuable chance
to improve the treatment of pro se litigants in Texas courts.

2. The record here demonstrates a pattern of procedural breakdowns, judicial
inaction, and a lack of meaningful opposition or engagement from the real party in
interest and her counsel. The relator, Charles Dustin Myers, has persistently and

skillfully advocated for his rights, yet finds himself without a lawful adversary or a

viable path to resolution due to the lower courts’ inaction and consistent 
misapplication of Texas law. This Court’s refusal to take up these mandamus 
petitions would leave those errors and inertia to fester, keeping the parties in 
perpetual uncertainty and undermining the rule of law. 
 
3. Moreover, by failing to intervene, the Court would forgo a unique 
opportunity to examine the evolving role of pro se litigants in complex family law 
proceedings. In this case, the relator’s filings exhibit a level of diligence, legal 
research, and procedural sophistication that in some respects surpasses that of the 
licensed attorneys. While the absence of lawyers often undermines the American 
adversarial model of adjudication, it can also – as here – highlight how a 
determined self-represented litigant can navigate the system and expose its 
shortcomings. Dismissing these petitions would mean losing the chance to provide 
much-needed guidance on accommodating and adjudicating cases involving pro se 
litigants, especially when those litigants prove more effective than their 
represented counterparts. 
 
4. The relator previously warned the Second Court of Appeals about these 
compounding issues, an analogy likening the underlying problems to the Hydra of 
Greek mythology – where cutting off one head results in two more growing in its 
place. That warning may have been dismissed as frivolous at the time, but the 
proliferation of mandamus filings (what began as three has now become five)

validates the Hydra analogy. Indeed, there exists no mechanism to resolve this 
case in the trial courts below that would align with Texas law. Despite no stay 
having been in place after one of the earlier petitions (No. 25-0361), the trial court 
has made no lawful progress, and continuous denials at every appellate level only 
compound the unresolved issues. In short, without the Supreme Court’s 
intervention, more mandamus heads will inevitably sprout, and the parties will 
remain in limbo indefinitely.

A. Texas Supreme Court’s Mandamus Authority 
 
5. The Texas Supreme Court has broad constitutional and statutory authority 
to issue writs of mandamus to correct abuses of discretion and ensure the proper 
administration of justice in the state’s courts. Under Texas Government Code 
§ 22.002(a): 
 
“the supreme court or a justice of the supreme court may issue writs of 
 
procedendo and certiorari and all writs of quo warranto and mandamus 
 
agreeable to the principles of law regulating those writs, against a statutory 
 
county court judge, a statutory probate court judge, a district judge, a court 
 
of appeals or a justice of a court of appeals, or any officer of state 
 
government except the governor, the court of criminal appeals, or a judge of 
 
the court of criminal appeals.”

5. The Texas Supreme Court has broad constitutional and statutory authority
to issue writs of mandamus to correct abuses of discretion and ensure the proper
administration of justice in the state’s courts. Under Texas Government Code

§ 22.002(a):

“the supreme court or a justice of the supreme court may issue writs of

county court judge, a statutory probate court judge, a district judge, a court

In short, the Supreme Court’s mandamus power extends to judges of the trial 
courts and intermediate courts of appeals to confine those courts to the lawful 
exercise of their jurisdiction or compel them to perform their duties.  
 
6. This mandamus authority is reinforced by the Texas Constitution. Article 
V, Section 31 of the Texas Constitution makes clear that if the Supreme Court does 
not act upon a timely filed motion for rehearing within 180 days, the motion is 
denied by operation of law. This constitutional provision underscores the 
expectation that the state’s highest court will timely oversee and supervise the 
administration of justice. The existence of a 180-day deadline for rehearing 
implicitly recognizes that prolonged inaction by the Supreme Court is not 
acceptable – a principle that resonates with the situation here, where prolonged 
inaction in the face of repeated mandamus petitions has left the litigants without 
relief. 
B. Mandamus as an Extraordinary Remedy 
 
7. Mandamus is an “extraordinary remedy available ‘only in situations 
involving manifest and urgent necessity and not for grievances that may be 
addressed by other remedies.’” To obtain mandamus relief, the relator must show 
(1) a clear abuse of discretion by the lower court, and (2) the absence of an 
adequate remedy at law, such as a normal appeal. In re Prudential Ins. Co. of

8. This Court has repeatedly emphasized that mandamus review is essential 
in exceptional cases to “preserve important substantive and procedural rights from 
impairment or loss, allow the appellate courts to give needed and helpful direction 
to the law that would otherwise prove elusive in appeals from final judgments, and 
spare private parties and the public the time and money utterly wasted enduring 
eventual reversal of improperly conducted proceedings”. Cascos v. Cameron

9. One traditional office of the writ of mandamus is to command an inferior 
court to discharge its duties—to “quicken[ ] [the court’s] negligence,” as 
Blackstone put it. More specifically, mandamus will lie to compel a judge to take 
up a case, to reach a final judgment, or to take other steps necessary to allow 
appellate review of the merits. This aspect of mandamus reflects the appellate 
courts’ broader supervisory role. The Texas Supreme Court, like its federal 
counterpart under the All Writs Act, possesses inherent authority to ensure that 
lower courts do not shirk their responsibilities. In cases where a trial court refuses

from reaching a final, appealable order, the Supreme Court’s mandamus power can 
be invoked to set the machinery of justice back on track. 
D. Pro Se Litigants and Systemic Concerns 
 
10. The presence of pro se litigants in complex civil and family law matters 
is a well-documented challenge for the courts. Civil courts in the United States 
have been suffering from a ‘pro se crisis’ for decades. Even when basic human 
needs are at issue...a high percentage of people are unable to afford to hire an 
attorney to represent them. The absence of lawyers can undermine the American 
adversarial model of adjudication; without counsel on both sides, there are real 
questions about whether court proceedings can be fundamentally fair. Courts and 
commentators have recognized this “pro se crisis” and have spent decades calling 
for reforms – from increasing legal aid funding to adjusting court procedures – to 
better accommodate the flood of self-represented litigants. This case exemplifies 
those concerns, but also shows that a savvy pro se litigant can, in effect, hold the 
system accountable for its own procedural missteps through persistent effort.

serious questions about the lower courts’ handling of recusal motions, case 
consolidation, and temporary orders in an underlying family-law dispute. Yet the 
response at every level so far has been silence or perfunctory denial. The real party 
in interest, Morgan Michelle Myers, and her counsel, Cooper L. Carter, have not 
meaningfully contested the Relator’s arguments, and in all instances have failed to 
file responsive briefs at all. Despite this vacuum, the trial court and the court of 
appeals have not granted the Relator any relief, nor have they moved the case 
forward in a lawful manner, nor provided any explanation to these issues. This 
leaves the Relator (and indeed both parties) in legal limbo – divorced from any 
timely resolution of their dispute, yet also deprived of any appellate review of the 
trial court’s orders, which the Relator contends are comically unlawful on their 
face.

voidable orders mean that there is no final judgment to appeal, and ordinary 
appellate remedies (or waiting indefinitely for action) are not adequate. Every day 
that passes without a corrective writ is essentially a day of de facto denial of the 
relator’s rights, with no clear end in sight. 
 
13. This is precisely the type of “manifest and urgent necessity” that justifies 
mandamus intervention. In re Prudential Ins. Co. of America, 148 S.W.3d 124,

including the right to a fair and impartial judge, the right to the care, custody, and 
control of his children, the right to property, and the right to due process in the 
form of notice and hearing on temporary orders – are at risk of being permanently 
lost or irreparably impaired. The harm of judicial inaction is not theoretical: it is 
manifest in the multiple petitions already filed and the trial court’s continuing 
inability to bring the case to a lawful conclusion. As this Court recognized in In re 
Prudential, mandamus is appropriate to “spare private parties and the public the 
time and money utterly wasted” by flawed proceedings that will eventually 
require reversal. That is the situation before this Court. Here, without mandamus 
relief, both the Relator and the public, which has an interest in the efficient use of 
judicial resources, will continue to suffer the waste and delay of a case stuck in 
procedural quicksand.

F. The Unique Role of the Pro Se Litigant 
 
14. This case also shines a light on the unique and evolving role of pro se 
litigants in Texas courts. The relator’s filings in the trial court, the court of appeals, 
and now the Supreme Court demonstrate a level of legal skill and tenacity that is 
uncommon even among represented parties. He has identified complex issues 
(such as a judge’s failure to recuse, or the void nature of orders issued after an 
improper case transfer) and presented them with clarity and supporting authority. 
In contrast, the opposing party’s counsel has often failed to respond or to engage 
with the merits of these issues. The result is a paradox: the unrepresented litigant is 
performing the role of a zealous advocate more effectively than the licensed 
attorney on the other side. 
 
 
15. By declining to address these mandamus petitions, the Supreme Court 
would forfeit an opportunity to provide guidance on how the judicial system 
should treat cases involving capable pro se litigants. Texas, like many jurisdictions, 
has traditionally struggled with accommodating self-represented parties – judges 
walk a fine line between explaining procedures and giving improper legal advice, 
and procedural rules are often unforgiving to those not trained in the law. However, 
when a pro se litigant not only meets but exceeds the court’s expectations (for 
example, by complying with briefing rules, citing precedent, and preserving error), 
the courts should respond by squarely addressing the litigant’s contentions.

Ignoring or summarily dismissing filings of this quality sends a discouraging 
message to pro se litigants and lowers public confidence in the courts. By taking up 
these petitions, the Supreme Court can affirm that justice is blind to whether a 
litigant has a law license and that the rule of law applies equally to all parties. 
G. The Risk of Endless Litigation and Systemic Breakdown 
 
16. If this Court remains silent in this case, the underlying issues will not 
resolve themselves – in fact, they are likely to proliferate. The Relator has no 
lawful opponent who can prosecute the case to conclusion, due to a tangle of 
disqualification and procedural voidness issues. Thus, every attempt by the trial 
court to move forward without higher guidance risks spawning yet another 
mandamus. This is the “Hydra” problem the relator cautioned against: without 
decisive action, each unresolved issue begets two more issues. The parties are 
effectively trapped in a cycle of one-sided orders and half-measures that cannot be 
appealed and yet do not achieve finality. Such a scenario is a textbook example of a 
“systemic breakdown” in the court process, where normal procedures fail and 
extraordinary intervention becomes necessary.

or transfer orders that would have forced parties to trial in the wrong forum, and to 
compel trial courts to proceed when a case has languished. When routine processes 
like recusal proceedings (25-0426), case consolidation (25-0378), hearing 
emergency motions (25-0367), or the adjudication of temporary orders (25-0361) 
break down in a way that leaves litigants with no effective advocate and no final 
judgment, mandamus is not only permissible but required. Yet here, it is 
continuously avoided. Allowing the trial court’s errors and the opposing party’s 
passivity to continue unchecked would signal that persistent procedural failures are 
tolerable. It would also underscore a troubling double standard: that a represented 
litigant’s inaction can effectively paralyze a case, whereas a diligent pro se 
litigant’s efforts can be ignored. Such an outcome would undermine confidence in 
the rule of law far beyond the confines of this case. The record is clear: the effort 
extends to the Relator, and nobody else. The judges below, the opposing counsel, 
and the OAG have all remained silent observers and non-participants.

or transfer orders that would have forced parties to trial in the wrong forum, and to
compel trial courts to proceed when a case has languished. When routine processes
like recusal proceedings (25-0426), case consolidation (25-0378), hearing
emergency motions (25-0367), or the adjudication of temporary orders (25-0361)
break down in a way that leaves litigants with no effective advocate and no final
judgment, mandamus is not only permissible but required. Yet here, it is

exercise of its original jurisdiction to order a trial court to vacate and expunge an 
invalid order”. Stoner v. Massey, 586 S.W.2d 843, 846 (Tex. 1979). Here, the lower 
courts have repeatedly failed to observe mandatory procedures – for example, 
failing to hold a hearing within the time required by law, or issuing orders without 
jurisdiction – and those failures have indeed rendered their actions invalid. Under 
Stoner and its progeny, the Supreme Court not only may, but must, use its 
mandamus authority to correct such invalid acts. Doing so vindicates the 
Legislature’s prescriptions (for recusal procedures, case assignment, etc.) and 
maintains the integrity of the judicial process. 
 
19. In this case, the corrective role of the Supreme Court is paramount. The 
Court’s intervention would restore order by (for example) vacating any void 
orders, compelling the assignment of a qualified judge, and clarifying the path 
forward for the trial court. It would also reinforce to the lower courts that 
procedural rules are not mere suggestions – they are obligations that ensure 
fairness. The Supreme Court’s voice needs to say, in effect, that what has happened 
so far is not in keeping with Texas law and must be fixed. Without such guidance, 
not only will this case languish, but other courts may take the wrong lesson that 
inaction or ad hoc procedures are acceptable when dealing with pro se litigants or 
convoluted cases. The Court’s supervisory power exists for precisely this scenario:

to step in when the normal process has failed and reorient the case onto a lawful

20. Finally, granting review in these mandamus petitions would carry 
broader benefits for the administration of justice in Texas. The Court’s opinion (or 
even a decision to request full briefing) could serve as a case study in how complex 
family cases with pro se parties should be handled. It could address lingering 
questions about recusal standards (e.g., how to handle alleged bias when multiple 
judges have touched a case), about consolidation and severance in procedurally 
snarled cases, and about the enforcement of temporary orders that lack a valid 
procedural basis. Such guidance would be welcomed by trial judges and litigants 
across the state, as these issues are not unique to this case. Moreover, an opinion 
could emphasize the importance of diligence and good faith by all parties – 
discouraging the sort of sandbagging or strategic silence that may have occurred 
here, where one side’s inaction has effectively stalled the proceedings.  
 
21. By taking up these mandamus petitions, or at least explaining one of 
them, the Court can provide much-needed direction to the lower courts, clarify the 
standards for recusal, consolidation, and temporary orders, and set a precedent for 
the fair and efficient treatment of pro se litigants in Texas when faced with such 
situations.

22. The petitions also spotlight the access-to-justice gap and how courts 
adapt or fail to adapt to it. By addressing the role of the evolving, diligent pro se 
litigant, this Court can send a message that all litigants are entitled to have their 
arguments heard and decided according to law, and that procedural justice should 
not depend on having a lawyer. The Court can encourage lower courts to be more 
proactive in managing cases with self-represented parties – for instance, by 
ensuring clear explanations of rulings and by being vigilant that one side’s failure 
to respond does not derail the case. Appellate courts, including this Court, are 
charged with maintaining the uniformity and integrity of the law. Sometimes that 
means answering novel substantive legal questions; other times, as here, it means 
intervening in the procedure of a case to correct course. Both aspects are equally 
important to public confidence. The broader implication of stepping in now is a 
reaffirmation that the courthouse doors are open to those who pursue justice 
diligently, lawyer or not, and that the courts of Texas will not abandon litigants to a

of the parties, the refusal to hear a properly filed motion, the improper 
consolidation, the failure to abide by standard recusal procedures, and the summary 
denial of a motion never filed for reasons that do not comport with the facts so 
clearly stated and which remain unrefuted. 
 
24. In sum, if this Court does not take up these issues on rehearing, it will 
not only compound the procedural and substantive harm already suffered by the 
parties but will also miss a critical opportunity to study and improve the 
administration of justice for the rapidly evolving legal landscape that could help 
circumvent the growing distrust in this system from the broader public. The 
Court’s continued silence would leave the parties in continued limbo, allow serious 
procedural failures to persist uncorrected, and undermine public confidence in the 
judiciary’s capacity for self-supervision. By contrast, granting mandamus review 
and providing clear guidance would restore order, ensure accountability, and 
reaffirm the Supreme Court’s role as the ultimate guardian of justice in Texas. The 
extraordinary facts of this case cry out for an extraordinary remedy – one that only 
this Court can provide. The Hydra of unresolved issues can be subdued, but only 
by a decisive stroke by the wisdom of our State’s highest Court.
