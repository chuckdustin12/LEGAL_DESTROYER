MEMORANDUM OF LAW

Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, initiated this action on December 18, 2023. She
allegedly retained the services of Cooper L. Carter on January 22, 2024. Today is August 18,
2025, and there exists no plausible explanation found within this record as to the series of
unlawful, unethical, and unprecedented events that have transpired since this matter’s inception.

Now, before any official reinstatement by the Regional Presiding Judge, and a pending
rule 12 motion against the opposing counsel, a pending DWOP motion, a pending mandamus in
the Texas Supreme Court, a pending disqualification motion against opposing counsel, an
unopposed summary judgment, and a plea to the jurisdiction, all of which have gone unanswered
by our friends on the other side, this court — once again — seeks to act sua sponte in an attempt to
set this matter for final trial, thereby attempting to cement the unlawful deprivation suffered by
the Respondent over the past two years. For the forthcoming reasons, the Respondent OBJECTS
to the notice setting a court proceeding and docket control order, and in support thereof, shows

the following:

I. INTRODUCTION 
 
1. The record demonstrates pervasive violations of due process, statutory requirements, 
and local rules, rendering the setting of a final trial improper and constitutionally infirm. Under 
Texas law and binding precedent, the cumulative procedural and jurisdictional defects in this 
matter mandate that the final trial setting be vacated until the Respondent’s rights to notice, 
hearing, a fair process is fully restored and the best interests of the children become priority. 
 
2. The Respondent’s objection to the final trial setting is firmly grounded in both 
statutory and constitutional law. The deprivation of his residence and property rights without an 
evidentiary hearing, which occurred on January 16, 2024, the lack of findings of fact, or 
opportunity to be heard, combined with irregularities such as fraudulent orders falsely claiming 
consent, unauthorized practice of law, recusal tampering, and dormant prosecution, collectively 
amount to a systemic denial of due process and judicial integrity. 
 
3. This court only seems to act upon receiving notice that the Respondent’s appellate 
efforts were denied – which changes nothing regarding the substantive issues herein that 
continue to be ignored.  A denial of a mandamus petition without any written opinion does not 
absolve this court of its responsibility to address these issues. Until these issues are adjudicated 
by this court – fairly and impartially – more mandamus petitions will follow, and more recusal 
proceedings will be initiated to receive a lawful explanation for the cumulative and compounding 
issues that continue to accumulate. 
 
4. Until an explanation is handed down by a lawful authority or the Respondent is labeled 
as a vexatious litigant, he will continue to seek justice for his children, himself, and will continue 
to utilize the appropriate legal channels to seek answers for the cumulative actions described in 
more detail below.

II. ANALYSIS OF THE ISSUES 
A. Deprivation of Residence and Property Without Hearing or Findings 
 
5. The Respondent was ordered to vacate his home based solely on unsubstantiated 
allegations of family violence, without any evidentiary hearing, findings of fact, or opportunity 
to be heard on January 16, 2024. This directly contravenes Texas Family Code § 85.001, which 
requires both a hearing and an affirmative finding of family violence before a protective order 
may issue. Outside of this requirement, this Court exceeded its’ statutory authority when 
ordering the Respondent to vacate. The absence of the statutory prerequisites renders the order 
void and a violation of due process (Tex. Fam. Code § 85.001; In re A.D.A., 287 S.W.3d 382, 384 
(Tex. App. 2009)). 
 
6. A Texas district court cannot order a respondent to vacate his home based solely on 
unsubstantiated allegations of family violence without holding a hearing or making the required 
statutory findings; such an order exceeds the court’s statutory authority under Texas Family Code 
§ 85.001 and is void. Requiring the respondent to show cause or prove why relief should not be 
granted improperly shifts the burden of proof and further violates due process. 
 
7. The Texas Family Code is unequivocal: a court may not issue a protective order, or any 
order excluding a person from their residence, without first conducting a hearing and making 
explicit findings that family violence has occurred. Section 85.001(a) requires a hearing and a 
finding of family violence as a condition precedent to any such order (Tex. Fam. Code § 85.001). 
Section 83.006 imposes even stricter requirements for temporary ex parte exclusion orders, 
mandating a sworn affidavit, in-person testimony, and specific findings of recent violence and 
ongoing danger (Tex. Fam. Code § 83.006). 
 
8. Here, these requirements were ignored, and the court acted ultra-vires from the onset.

B. Right to De Novo Review and Failure to Provide Relief 
 
7. The associate judge’s order signed on March 14, 2024, was subject to the Respondent’s 
right to request a de novo hearing before the referring court under Texas Family Code § 201.015, 
had specific procedural requirements which were not met, and the record indicates that this 
hearing was the result of a timely filed emergency motion to vacate and request for de novo 
review, which ultimately denied without explanation. This failure to provide a written rationale 
further violated the Respondent’s statutory and constitutional rights (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.015).  
C. Fraudulent Agreed Orders and Ineffective Assistance 
 
8. This court signed a unilateral ‘agreement’ containing only one side’s signature when 
the signature page itself expressly states “AGREED AND CONSENTED TO BY:”. The per 
curiam denials from the Second Court of Appeals regarding these issues does not absolve this 
court of the responsibility to address them, especially prior to moving this matter towards a final 
setting sua sponte. 
 
9. The associate judge compelled the Respondent to sign an “agreed order” that falsely 
recited universal consent, despite his express objection and lack of signature. This constitutes a 
fraudulent order and deprives the Respondent of the right to contest property and parental issues 
on the merits. Such conduct, especially when facilitated by the Respondent’s own counsel acting 
against his interests, raises serious concerns of ineffective assistance and collusion, which are 
recognized grounds for relief. 
 
10. Now, this court seeks to move this matter to final trial, requiring the parties “shall 
provide the Court a written proposed property division at the time of trial”, when the current 
orders state that the property has already been divided in a “just in right manner.” The 
Respondent’s property has been destroyed by the Petitioner, leaving no property to divide.

C. Dormant Prosecution and Bad Faith 
 
10. The Mother, as movant, failed to diligently prosecute her claims, obtaining repeated 
continuances without substantive filings for over 18 months. Texas law and local rules support 
dismissal for want of prosecution in such circumstances, as the case was effectively dormant and 
the Respondent deprivation was prolonged without justification (In re Garcia, No. 02-20-00161-
CV, 2020 WL 4812632, at *1 (Tex. App. Aug. 20, 2020)). In fact, the only recent action taken by 
the opposing side was to suddenly prevent relief in the 233rd district court, which ultimately 
resulted in two additional mandamus petitions that received no participation or input. 
D. Judicial and Staff Misconduct 
 
11. The record details multiple instances of judicial officers acting ultra vires—issuing 
orders while recusal or mandamus proceedings were pending, consolidating cases sua sponte in 
violation of local rules, and issuing orders without proper reinstatement. Court staff tampered 
with recusal motions by removing exhibits and altering submissions, which is not authorized 
under Rule 18a and undermines the integrity of the judicial process. 
 
12. Such conduct not only violates procedural rules but also implicates due process and 
the right to a fair tribunal. The Texas Supreme Court has held that due process violations render 
judgments void and subject to collateral attack, regardless of procedural deadlines (In re E.R., 
385 S.W.3d 552, 555 (Tex. 2012)). 
 
13. Regarding staff misconduct – this court has yet to explain why on October 8, 2024, a 
modified version of a joint motion to recuse was forwarded to the Regional Presiding Judge with 
missing exhibits and without the attached affidavit. The reasons given by the Court Coordinator 
– Lindsey Baker – contradict Tarrant County e-filing procedures, and directly contradicts the 
Frequently Asked Questions section of the court’s website.

continuances without substantive filings for over 18 months. Texas law and local rules support
dismissal for want of prosecution in such circumstances, as the case was effectively dormant and
the Respondent deprivation was prolonged without justification (Jn re Garcia, No. 02-20-00161-
CV, 2020 WL 4812632, at *1 (Tex. App. Aug. 20, 2020)). In fact, the only recent action taken by
the opposing side was to suddenly prevent relief in the 233" district court, which ultimately
resulted in two additional mandamus petitions that received no participation or input.

D. Judicial and Staff Misconduct

11. The record details multiple instances of judicial officers acting ultra vires—issuing
orders while recusal or mandamus proceedings were pending, consolidating cases sua sponte in
violation of local rules, and issuing orders without proper reinstatement. Court staff tampered
with recusal motions by removing exhibits and altering submissions, which is not authorized

Frequently Asked Questions section of the court’s website.

14. The Court Coordinator’s continued involvement in recusal proceedings showcases a 
deeper level of judicial bias and impartiality, as the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure have no 
designation of responsibility for a court coordinator regarding recusal – likely intended given the 
fact that coordinators are appointed by the district judge’s whom they serve. By facilitating 
actions that are otherwise reserved for court clerks, the Court Coordinator continues to act 
outside of her role, and furthers the one-sided favoritism displayed by the Court, and raises a 
reasonable concern that the court is not acting impartially. 
E. Unauthorized Practice and Void Filings 
 
15. Opposing counsel has filed two motions in this case. One came on April 24, 2024, 
seeking to set this matter for a pre-trial conference, and a motion to consolidate – which was 
granted sua sponte by the District Judge of the 233rd District Court in violation of local rules and 
in the face of an objection. 
 
16. The record also shows that opposing counsel lacks authority to act, with e-filing 
credentials tied to a prior employer and later filings made by another firm without substitution of 
counsel. Filings by unauthorized persons are void and further undermine the legitimacy of the 
proceedings (In re Garcia, No. 02-20-00161-CV, 2020 WL 4812632, at *1 (Tex. App. Aug. 20, 
2020)). 
F. Orders by Non-Reinstated Judges 
 
17. Orders issued by this Court without official reinstatement by the regional presiding 
judge are void ab initio, as a judge lacks authority to act while recusal is pending or before 
reinstatement. Such ultra vires acts are subject to mandamus or other extraordinary relief (In re 
Garcia, No. 02-20-00161-CV, 2020 WL 4812632, at *1 (Tex. App. Aug. 20, 2020)).

17. Orders issued by this Court without official reinstatement by the regional presiding
judge are void ab initio, as a judge lacks authority to act while recusal is pending or before
reinstatement. Such ultra vires acts are subject to mandamus or other extraordinary relief (/n re

Garcia, No. 02-20-00161-CV, 2020 WL 4812632, at *1 (Tex. App. Aug. 20, 2020)).

18. Furthermore, this Court continues to avoid the issues, and chose to set this matter for 
final trial immediately after the Supreme Court denied four of five pending mandamus petitions, 
showing a clear effort to avoid the issues despite being fully aware of them. 
III. Cumulative Denial of Due Process 
 
19. The cumulative effect of these irregularities—fraudulent orders, unauthorized 
practice, recusal tampering, dormant prosecution, ultra vires judicial acts, and denial of notice 
and hearing—amounts to a systemic denial of due process and judicial integrity. The Texas 
Supreme Court has recognized that such violations render judgments void and subject to 
collateral attack, and that constitutional demands of due process override statutory requirements 
(In re E.R., 385 S.W.3d 552, 555 (Tex. 2012)).  
 
20. The repeated denials by the appellate courts do not alter the facts of this matter and 
supporting law. The continued disregard is not the answer, and will only lead to more recusal 
proceedings and mandamus petitions until a lawful explanation is handed down by a fair and 
impartial judge, regardless of which level of the judiciary it comes from.  
IV. Conclusion 
 
21. The setting of a final trial under these circumstances would perpetuate and compound 
the denial of the Respondent’s constitutional and statutory rights. The record demonstrates a 
pattern of procedural and jurisdictional defects, including deprivation of residence and property 
without hearing or findings, lack of diligence by the movant, ineffective assistance of counsel, 
fraudulent orders, unauthorized practice, judicial and staff misconduct, and denial of notice and 
opportunity to be heard, and continued disregard for the best interests of the children. 
 
22. Texas law, as reflected in the Family Code and binding precedent, requires that these 
defects be remedied before any final trial may proceed. The only appropriate course is to vacate

the final trial setting, restore the Respondent’s rights to due process, and ensure that all future 
proceedings comply strictly with statutory and constitutional requirements. Failure to do so 
would result in irreparable harm and a breakdown of judicial integrity, warranting extraordinary 
relief through additional recusal proceedings and mandamus petitions. 
 
23. For all these reasons, the Respondent OBJECTS to notice of trial setting, and reserves 
the right to seek additional relief through the appropriate legal channels, including but not 
limited to further recusal proceedings, mandamus proceedings, and claims brought in federal 
court for the willful deprivation of constitutionally protected rights and through actions taken 
ultra vires by multiple judges who have yet to provide any substantive explanation for the 
conduct alleged herein. 
 
24. Therefore, the Court should VACATE this order, the current temporary orders signed 
on March 14, 2024, and address the substantive issues as a priority and in accordance with Texas 
Law at the first possibly opportunity. 
 
25.  The Respondent’s objection to the final trial setting is well-founded in law, and the 
court is obligated to remedy the procedural and jurisdictional defects before proceeding. Failure 
to do so risks further mandamus proceedings, reversal on appeal, and potential federal claims for 
deprivation of rights.  
 
26. The Respondent puts the court on notice that  he will be seeking prospective 
declaratory and injunctive relief through an ultra-vires claim shall these issues not be addressed 
at the earliest opportunity. The only appropriate course is to vacate the trial setting, address the 
underlying due process violations, restore the Respondent’s rights, ensure strict compliance with 
statutory and constitutional requirements in all future proceedings, and require the opposing 
party to show cause for the lack of participation in this matter.
