As clarified in Guaranty Federal Sav. Bank v. Horseshoe Operating Co., 793 S.W.2d 652 
(Tex. 1990), "the party who opposed the intervention has the burden to challenge it by a motion 
to strike." Here, the Respondent is challenging the OAG’s involvement in this matter and 
requests clarification on their role in the litigation. By following clearly established Texas 
prescedent and utilizing the  
II. LEGAL ANALYSIS 
The right to intervene in Texas is governed primarily by Rule 60 of the Texas Rules of 
Civil Procedure. This rule provides that: "Any party may intervene by filing a pleading, subject 
to being stricken out by the court for sufficient cause on the motion of any party." In re R.M., No. 
05-18-01127-CV (Tex. App. May 24, 2019); Smith v. City of Garland, 523 S.W.3d 234 (Tex. 
App. 2017); R. Hassell & Co. v. Springwoods Realty Co., NO. 01-17-00154-CV (Tex. App. Apr 
19, 2018). 
This rule establishes that while intervention is permitted as a matter of right, it is not 
absolute and remains subject to judicial oversight. The Texas Supreme Court has clarified that 
Rule 60 "authorizes a party with a justiciable interest in a pending suit to intervene in the suit as 
a matter of right." In re Union Carbide Corp., 273 S.W.3d 152, 154 (Tex. 2008). However, this 
right is balanced against the court's obligation to ensure the efficient administration of justice. 
A. The Justiciable Interest Requirement 
For an intervention to be sustained, the intervenor must demonstrate a "justiciable 
interest" in the pending suit. This requirement serves as a threshold that must be met before a 
court will allow an outside party to join ongoing litigation. According to Texas courts, an 
intervenor has a justiciable interest in a lawsuit "when his interests will be affected by the 
litigation." Brown v. Freed, 03-21-00556-CV (Tex. App. May 10, 2023). This interest may be

The right to intervene in Texas is governed primarily by Rule 60 of the Texas Rules of

"legal or equitable in nature." Brown v. Freed (Tex. App. Aug. 1, 2023) (citing Mendez v. 
Brewer, 626 S.W.2d 498, 499 (Tex. 1982)). 
B. Procedure for Challenging an Intervention  
An important procedural aspect of Rule 60 is that an intervenor is not required to secure 
the court's permission before intervening. Rather, "the party who opposed the intervention has 
the burden to challenge it by a motion to strike." Guaranty Federal Sav. Bank v. Horseshoe 
Operating Co., 793 S.W.2d 652 (Tex. 1990); Musick v. Zamora, 03-21-00555-CV (Tex. App. Apr 
27, 2023) (citing Guaranty Fed., 793 S.W.2d at 657). 
Once a motion to strike is filed, "the burden shifts to the intervenor to show a justiciable 
interest in the lawsuit." R. Hassell & Co. v. Springwoods Realty Co., NO. 01-17-00154-CV (Tex. 
App. Apr 19, 2018) (citing Union Carbide, 273 S.W.3d at 155); In re R.M., No. 05-18-01127-CV 
(Tex. App. May 24, 2019) (citing In re Union Carbide Corp., 273 S.W.3d 152, 155 (Tex. 2008)). 
C. Burden on the OAG 
Because a motion to strike has now been filed in this case, the burden would shift to the 
OAG to demonstrate a justiciable interest in the litigation sufficient to overcome concerns about 
delay or prejudice. As established in In re R.M., No. 05-18-01127-CV (Tex. App. May 24, 
2019) and R. Hassell & Co. v. Springwoods Realty Co., NO. 01-17-00154-CV (Tex. App. Apr 19, 
2018), "the intervenor bears the burden to demonstrate a justiciable interest in the pending suit." 
Here, the OAG would need to articulate how its interests will be affected by the litigation 
and why its continued involvement is necessary despite its lack of action. If the OAG cannot 
demonstrate a sufficient justiciable interest, or if the court determines that any such interest is 
outweighed by the delay or prejudice being caused, the court would have grounds to strike the 
intervention.

III. APPLICATION 
The three-pronged test established in Guaranty Federal Savings Bank v. Horseshoe 
Operating Co., 793 S.W.2d 652, 657 (Tex. 1990) provides a framework for this analysis. An 
intervenor must show that (1) it could have brought the same action, or any part thereof, in its 
own name, or if the action had been brought against it, it would be able to defeat recovery; (2) 
the intervention will not complicate the case by an excessive multiplication of the issues; and (3) 
the intervention is almost essential to effectively protect the intervenor's interest. 
This framework should be applied within the instant matter in the court’s determination 
of whether to strike the intervention of the Office of the Attorney General. In the pleading itself, 
attached as Exhibit A, the OAG is ambiguous regarding its’ claims. The uncertainty surrounding 
the “prior proceedings” referenced, the request for the court to “enter appropriate orders”, and 
the mismatched signature line all point to the OAG not having a legitimate interest in the matter. 
When coupled with their lack of activity or participation in the case, a response should be 
requested to clarify their involvement. 
In the interest of judicial economy, the Respondent objects to any settings on this matter 
until the Office of the Attorney General furnishes a written response.  
CONCLUSION AND PRAYER 
For all the reasons stated herein, the Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, 
respectfully requests that this Honorable Court: 
1. Request a response from Holly Hayes, and request that she demonstrate a justiciable 
interest in this matter and clarify the undue delay lack of participation in the 
proceedings;

TO THE HONORABLE JAMES MUNFORD OF THE 322"
DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY:

- In this document, "the Couple" refers collectively to the Petitioner and Respondent.
The Respondent respectfully objects to the Title-[V Agency intervention for
the foregoing reasons:
I. BACKGROUND
1. In January of 2021, the decision to pursue a career from home came from a
deep desire within the Respondent to provide a dual role for his Children — being that
of a provider and a caregiver. Leading up to that point, the Couple had alternated

roles in providing for their children: one parent worked to support the family

financially while the other assumed a full-time caretaker role. However, this decision 
ended up being in the best interest of the children. 
2. The harmonious arrangement was greatly facilitated by the support of
Margie and Jesse Wilson—next-door neighbors, landlords, and great-grandparents to 
the children involved in this case. The Wilsons provided a stable and affordable 
home at a discounted rental rate of $800 per month, laying a foundation for a 
nurturing and stable environment for the children. 
With regular, daily access to 
both parents and the added benefit of their great grandparents living next door on a 
tranquil cul-de-sac in Watauga—the children benefitted from a uniquely supportive 
and loving environment, which created an ideal situation for the children's growth 
and well-being.  
3. The new arrangement afforded the Petitioner a significant amount of time,
which she allocated to becoming more involved with the PTA, eventually becoming 
President. The Respondent continued to pursue growth and expand his knowledge in 
the fields of market finance, programming, SEC law, and legal transcription via 
Crowd Surf and similar platforms while both parents remained daily figures in all 
facets of their day-to-day lives. 
II. STATUTORY PROTECTIONS
4. The Texas Family Code references “the best interest of the child” 109
times throughout its’ 1,627 pages. The word “always” appears just once – within Id § 
153.002.  
5. The language provided by Id – being unambiguous on its’ face – shows a
clear requirement by the State to meet its’ statutory requirement:

“[t]he best interest of the child shall always be the primary 
consideration of the court in determining the issues of conservatorship and 
possession of and access to the child. “ Id. 
6. These statutory protections “…are [clearly] indicative of the wide
discretion the Legislature has granted the courts to act when the best interest of the 
child would be served thereby." Lutheran Social Service, Inc. v. Meyers, 460 S.W.2d 
887 (Tex. 1970). Despite this wide discretion, this court has chosen not to use it. 
7. Long ago, in Holley V. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367 (Tex. 1976) the Supreme
Court of Texas provided this State with a non-exhaustive list of factors that the court 
may use in determining the best interest of the Child. Despite these factors, the court 
has taken into consideration none of them. 
8. In more recent jurisprudence, the United States Supreme Court in Troxel v.
Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000), affirmed that under the Fourteenth Amendment, 
parents have a fundamental right to direct the care, custody, and control of their 
children.  
9. When contested issues are at hand, the Texas Family Code affords litigants
with a reporter of record to preserve the ability to make an effective appeal. Id 
§105.003. This  statutory mandate was ignored.
10. When a Petitioner waives the 60-day waiting period for divorce claiming
an active order of protection exists against the Respondent, the Petitioner is required 
to attach the order to the Petition prior to any hearing. Id § 6.405(b). Despite no such 
order existing, no hearing should have ever taken place.

11. On January 16th, 2024, the State simply did what it cannot do, and failed
to offer the State mandated protections afforded by Id. 
12. The decision rendered on 01/16/2024 was a de facto temporary
termination of parental rights prior to any evidentiary hearing taking place. 
13. The subsequent order rendered on 01/22/2024 by Judge Kaitcer
prolonged the initial orders. 
14. On February 1st, 2024, a settlement agreement was drafted by the
Respondent’s own legal counsel, who advised the Respondent to sign the agreement, 
resulting in his immediate termination and challenge of the original agreement on 
reconsideration. A true and accurate copy of this agreement has been attached hereto 
as Exhibit A. 
15. A hearing wasn’t scheduled until March 14th, 2024, due to delays by our
friends on the other side, who have filed no opposition to any claims for relief made 
by the Respondent or allegations asserted. In fact, this was the only hearing that took 
place in this case. 
16. Despite invoking the statutory protections mentioned above at the
hearing, the court rendered temporary orders which were permitted to be reduced to 
writing outside of their own procedural requirements ordered by the same judge by 
an attorney who had no initial desire to represent the Petitioner in the first place. 
17. Despite the hearing being contested, and notwithstanding the statutory
requirement for the court to provide a court reporter in such cases, this requirement 
was once again ignored. This omission rendered it impossible to properly raise an

objection to the deprivation, as the essential element needed to make the objection 
was not provided. 
18. Given the State’s initial failure to uphold its mandated requirements set
forth in the Texas Family Code, any further State intervention would lead to and has 
led to the same failure giving the magnitude of the decision made at the onset. 
19. This court has no facts regarding the decisions made affecting the parent-
child relationship and therefore has not considered the best interest of the child. 
IV. CONTINUOUS DEFECT
20. The last contact with the opposing counsel occurred on May 19th in
response to a defective IWO regarding the relevance of the orders in question. A true

21. The consent from the Respondent is what this court relies on. Without it –
there’s no basis for any decision made. "Once the trial court renders an agreed 
judgment, a party may not withdraw his consent if the trial court was unaware of any 
objection at the time of rendition.” In re D.S., 76 S.W.3d 512 (Tex. App. 2002); see 
First Heights Bank, FSB v. Marom, 934 S.W.2d 843 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.]

well aware of consent not being present at the time of rendition, but rendered them 
anyway.

VI. PREMATURITY
22. The intervention request made by the Title-IV Agency is premature. The
case is currently pending review in the Supreme Court of Texas, and the Agency has 
no facts pertaining to this case as outlined in the language of their pleading.  
23. Rather than intervening on an erroneous and fraudulently rendered
temporary order prior to any factual understanding of the case - the agency should 
consider filing an amicus brief in support of the Respondent with the Supreme Court 
of Texas given the destruction caused by the State thus far – or request findings of 
fact and conclusions of law from the trial court. The State’s mandate to enforce and 
establish child support should come only second to and after affirmation that the 
current custodial arrangements are in the best interest of the child. 
24. The Respondent timely requested findings of fact and conclusions of law
regarding the current orders in question over 90 days ago which have yet to be 
answered. 
VII. CONCLUSION
25. This request for intervention is another attempt by our friends on the other
side to have the work which should already be on file with the court completed for 
them. 
26. After seven months of litigation, our friends on the other side have done
nothing but delay proceedings, file fraudulent and inaccurate pleadings, ignore civil 
procedure, and are now trying to enforce a void order rendered outside of their own

VI. PREMATURITY

22. The intervention request made by the Title-[V Agency is premature. The
case is currently pending review in the Supreme Court of Texas, and the Agency has
no facts pertaining to this case as outlined in the language of their pleading.

23. Rather than intervening on an erroneous and fraudulently rendered
temporary order prior to any factual understanding of the case - the agency should
consider filing an amicus brief in support of the Respondent with the Supreme Court
of Texas given the destruction caused by the State thus far — or request findings of
fact and conclusions of law from the trial court. The State’s mandate to enforce and
establish child support should come only second to and after affirmation that the
current custodial arrangements are in the best interest of the child.

24. The Respondent timely requested findings of fact and conclusions of law
regarding the current orders in question over 90 days ago which have yet to be
answered.

Vil. CONCLUSION

25. This request for intervention is another attempt by our friends on the other
side to have the work which should already be on file with the court completed for
them.

26. After seven months of litigation, our friends on the other side have done
nothing but delay proceedings, file fraudulent and inaccurate pleadings, ignore civil
procedure, and are now trying to enforce a void order rendered outside of their own

procedural requirements.

27.The unacceptable negligence on behalf of Cooper L. Carter and the trial
court as a whole all stems from the intentional, malicious, and deceptive pleadings 
filed by the Petitioner, and influenced by Daniel Branthoover, and Margie Wilson 
resulting in direct interference with the Respondent’s constitutional rights.  
28. No amount of child support can replace what this State and the Petitioner
have willingly destroyed with the assistance of Cooper L. Carter, who should be 
required to disqualify herself from the case due to the inability to perform her duties 
competently. Given she was required to represent the Petitioner in the first place 
against her own wishes – the same requirement to withdrawal is appropriate here. 
VIII. PRAYER
Respondent respectfully prays for the following: 
1. Deny further state intervention until the facts of the case are before the
court.
2. Provide findings of fact and conclusions of law for the orders in question as
requested on March 26th, 2024, and how they are in the best interest of the
Child.
3. Conduct any future hearings in the District Court furnished with a court
reporter as mandated by the Texas Family Code.
4. Provide any other equitable relief the court deems necessary.
Respectfully Submitted,

Payments:  You must send child support payments payable by income withholding to the appropriate State Disbursement 
Unit or to a tribal CSE agency within 7 business days, or fewer if required by state law, after the date the income would 
have been paid to the employee/obligor and include the date you withheld the support from his or her income.  You may 
combine withheld amounts from more than one employee/obligor’s income in a single payment as long as you separately

Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) Child Support Portal. 
Lump Sum Payments:  You may be required to notify a state or tribal CSE agency of upcoming lump sum payments to 
this employee/obligor such as bonuses, commissions, or severance pay.  Contact the sender to determine if you are

to provide contacts, addresses, and other information about their companies.  Child support payments may not be made 
through the federal OCSE Child Support Portal. 
Liability:  If you have any doubts about the validity of this IWO, contact the sender.  If you fail to withhold income from the
