TO THE HONORABLE JUSTICES OF THE SECOND COURT OF APPEALS: 
Petitioner, Charles Dustin Myers, files this Emergency Motion for Temporary 
Declaratory Relief and respectfully shows the Court the following: 
I. INTRODUCTION 
This is an extraordinary case requiring extraordinary relief. For over a year, Relator has 
been barred from his residence and separated from his children based on court orders that are 
unquestionably void ab initio. These orders explicitly state that Relator agreed to their terms, yet 
they do not bear his signature—a fatal defect that renders them legal nullities from inception. 
The Texas Supreme Court has consistently held that orders lacking required consent are 
void and unenforceable. Relator continues to suffer ongoing harm due to the existence of these 
void orders. The case has remained inactive due to non-prosecution by opposing counsel, Cooper 
L. Carter, while Relator's children lack access to both parents, and Relator remains unable to 
work due to this untenable situation. 
This Court has the authority and duty to declare these orders void ab initio by providing 
immediate declaratory relief to prevent further irreparable harm to Relator and his children. 
II. BACKGROUND 
This case presents an extraordinary situation of ongoing harm that demands immediate 
judicial intervention. For more than a year, Relator Charles Dustin Myers has been wrongfully 
barred from his own residence and home, separated from his children, and placed in an 
impossible financial situation, all while the underlying case has languished without progress due 
to systematic non-prosecution by opposing counsel. In fact, the last action taken by the opposing 
counsel in the divorce matter was on April 24, 2024, nearly one year ago.

In March 2024, Petitioner was abruptly removed from his residence at 6641 Anne Court, 
Watauga, Texas, through an illegal lockout by the real party in interest. With an upcoming 
hearing scheduled for March 14, 2024, Relator stayed with a relative temporarily with the 
expectation to prevail at the hearing.  
However, when he made his appearance, the Relator was served with the orders that have 
been wreaking havoc on the lives of the children without notice, and they were rendered as a 
consent judgement despite Respondent not consenting to the terms of the order. APP 2.38 
Given Relator’s need for the residence to sustain his business operations, he has been 
forced to live in alternative housing arrangements, has suffered extensive business losses MR 
9.7, and most critically: the children’s status quo have been upended and have neither parent in 
their day-to-day lives. 
This situation has created an untenable financial burden that has severely impacted 
Relator’s ability to maintain stable employment and provide for himself and his children, and the 
Relator has fought relentlessly without any participation from the opposing side seeking relief 
without any opposition from the opposing side regarding the claims raised. All this information 
was pointed out in the emergency TRO that the 233rd refused to hear on March 28th, 2025. MR 
7.1. There remains no substantive response from the opposing party, who has been notified of 
this motion, the claims for relief made, the allegations made, and their continued silence has 
prejudiced the Relator for the last 11 months. 
B. Prior Mandamus Filings and Lack of Case Progression 
On April 8th, 2024, Relator filed a Petition for Writ of Mandamus with this court seeking 
emergency relief from the same orders. Unfortunately, at that time, the Relator’s mandamus was 
fatally deficient and a mandamus record was never filed. He sought judicial intervention to

address the fundamental violations of his due process rights and parental rights. Despite these 
good faith efforts to seek relief through proper legal channels, these mandamus actions did not 
result in any meaningful resolution or progress in the underlying case due to the defects in the 
pleadings. 
Since April 2024, the underlying case has remained effectively dormant. There has been 
no action by the opposing party, and there was no effort to prosecute as Relator sought relief in 
the second court of appeals in 2024. See 02-24-00149-CV; see also 24-0395. 
The opposing party has been challenged under Rule 12 in both instances, and had it not 
been for the original SAPCR filed on March 19, 2025, by the Relator, there was no indication 
that the opposing party would have ever continued moving the case towards final resolution. MR 
6.4. 
Notably, the Petition for Writ of Mandamus filed under cause number 02-24-00149-CV 
was denied exactly a year ago today, and now Relator returns before this court today hoping this 
court can see there truly is no adequate remedy by an appeal, and mandamus and this motion for 
relief should issue given no substantive action has occurred outside of the Relator’s pursuit of 
relief since then. 
C. Non-Prosecution by Opposing Counsel 
At the heart of this extraordinary situation is the systematic non-prosecution of this case 
by Respondent's attorney, COOPER L. CARTER. For over a year, CARTER has effectively 
abandoned the divorce matter only to show up in the SAPCR to prevent immediate relief from 
being obtained by the Relator. The original answer from the real party in interest filed in the 
SAPCR was the first pleading filed since April 24th, 2024, by the opposing side. MR 3.1

Most recently, this pattern of obstruction was demonstrated when the Associate Judge of 
the 233rd District Court refused to hear Petitioner's properly filed Emergency Motion for 
Temporary Restraining Order based solely on CARTER's verbal claim about a future filing in 
another court—a filing that had not yet occurred and would not occur until several days later and 
was the improper motion. MR 4, SUPP 2.18. Further, all this action happened with a pending 
Dismissal for Want of Prosecution filed and served to the opposing party on January 24, 2025, 
which remains unanswered. SUPP 3.2 
III. ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES 
A. Standard for Emergency Declaratory Relief 
Declaratory relief is a judicial remedy that allows parties to seek a court's determination 
of their rights, status, and legal relations without requiring further relief. This court can issue 
such relief pursuant to the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act. The Act is a remedial statute 
designed “to settle and to afford relief from uncertainty and insecurity with respect to 
rights, status, and other legal relations.” Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 37.002(b). It provides: 
“A person . . . whose rights, status, or other legal relations are affected by a statute, municipal 
ordinance, contract, or franchise may have determined any question of construction or validity 
arising under the . . . statute, ordinance, contract, or franchise and obtain a declaration of rights, 
status, or other legal relations thereunder.” Id. § 37.004(a). 
Here, Relator and his children have suffered ongoing irreparable harm from facially void 
orders which have prevented Relator from operating the at-home business that his family has 
relied on and have destroyed the status quo. Prior to these orders, the children enjoyed 
continuous and frequent access to both parents. Now, they are left in the daily care of relatives, 
have been deprived of daily interactions with their father, and are being led to believe the divorce

is final when it hasn’t even started yet. APP 1.2 Under these orders, the case has effectively 
stalled and has turned into a one-sided pursuit of relief by the Relator to dispose of these order 
which claim consent where it was not provided. 
B. Consent Judgements Rendered Without True Consent 
Under Texas law, a judgment or order is void ab initio when it is apparent that the court 
rendering judgment "had no jurisdiction of the parties or property, no jurisdiction of the subject 
matter, no jurisdiction to enter the particular judgment, or no capacity to act." Browning v. 
Prostok, 165 S.W.3d 336, 346 (Tex. 2005). Critically, orders that purport to be based on a party's 
consent, but lack that party's actual consent, are void ab initio. This principle is firmly 
established in Texas jurisprudence. 
In the landmark case of Burnaman v. Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288 (Tex. 1951), the Texas 
Supreme Court established the fundamental principle that "a valid consent judgment cannot be 
rendered by a court when consent of one of the parties thereto is wanting." Id. The Court further 
declared that "without such consent the judgment is void." Id. at 291. 
The Burnaman Court emphasized that consent must exist "at the very moment the court 
undertakes to make the agreement the judgment of the court." Id. It is not sufficient that a party's 
consent may have been given at some prior time; the consent must be present when the judgment 
is rendered. The Court held that when a trial court has knowledge that one of the parties does not 
consent to a judgment purportedly agreed to by their attorney, "the trial court should refuse to 
give the agreement the sanction of the court." Id. 
In the present case, the orders at issue explicitly state that Relator agreed to their terms, 
yet they lack his signature—the most basic and fundamental evidence of consent. APP 2.1, APP 
2.38 This is not merely a technical defect but goes to the very heart of the court's authority to

issue the orders. Without Relator's actual consent, as evidenced by the missing signatures, the 
orders are void ab initio and have no legal effect. 
C. The Court Has Authority to Declare Orders Void Ab Initio 
A void judgment can be collaterally attacked at any time. In re E.R., 385 S.W.3d 552, –––
– (Tex.2012). A collateral attack seeks to avoid the binding effect of a judgment to obtain 
specific relief that the judgment currently impedes. Browning v. Prostok, 165 S.W.3d 336, 346 
(Tex.2005). Here, because the orders are facially void under the Burman precedent, they can be 
attacked collaterally. The binding effect the Relator seeks to eliminate is the inability to access 
his home, personal belongings, children, and his normal place of business that has been 
persisting for over a year. 
It has also been held that "It is not necessary to take any steps to have a void judgment 
reversed, vacated, or set aside, it may be impeached in any action direct or, collateral.” Holder v. 
Scott, 396 S.W.2d 906, (Tex.Civ.App., Texarkana, 1965, writ ref., n.r.e.). A court cannot confer 
jurisdiction where none existed and cannot make a void proceeding valid. “It is clear and well-
established law that a void order can be challenged in any court", Old Wayne Mutual Life 
Association v. McDonough, 204 U.S. 8 (1907), 204 U. S. 8,27 S. Ct. 236 (1907). Therefore, 
because the orders in question expressly claim consent where none was given, this court can and 
should declare them void, which would restore the rights of the parties pending any further 
action in the trial courts. 
IV. CONCLUSION AND PRAYER 
This Court stands as the last bulwark against a cascade of injustices that have persisted 
unabated for over a year. What began as a family dispute has devolved into a prolonged, 
unconscionable deprivation of Relator’s constitutional rights—his right to parent his children, his

issue the orders. Without Relator's actual consent, as evidenced by the missing signatures, the
orders are void ab initio and have no legal effect.
C. The Court Has Authority to Declare Orders Void Ab Initio

A void judgment can be collaterally attacked at any time. Jn re E.R., 385 S.W.3d 552, —
— (Tex.2012). A collateral attack seeks to avoid the binding effect of a judgment to obtain
specific relief that the judgment currently impedes. Browning v. Prostok, 165 S.W.3d 336, 346
(Tex.2005). Here, because the orders are facially void under the Burman precedent, they can be
attacked collaterally. The binding effect the Relator seeks to eliminate is the inability to access
his home, personal belongings, children, and his normal place of business that has been
persisting for over a year.

It has also been held that "It is not necessary to take any steps to have a void judgment
reversed, vacated, or set aside, it may be impeached in any action direct or, collateral.” Holder v.
Scott, 396 S.W.2d 906, (Tex.Civ.App., Texarkana, 1965, writ ref., n.r.e.). A court cannot confer
jurisdiction where none existed and cannot make a void proceeding valid. “It is clear and well-
established law that a void order can be challenged in any court", Old Wayne Mutual Life
Association v. McDonough, 204 U.S. 8 (1907), 204 U. S. 8,27 S. Ct. 236 (1907). Therefore,
because the orders in question expressly claim consent where none was given, this court can and
should declare them void, which would restore the rights of the parties pending any further
action in the trial courts.

IV. CONCLUSION AND PRAYER

This Court stands as the last bulwark against a cascade of injustices that have persisted

unabated for over a year. What began as a family dispute has devolved into a prolonged,

unconscionable deprivation of Relator’s constitutional rights—his right to parent his children, his

right to reside in his own home, and his right to operate the business that sustains them. The 
orders in question were entered without consent, without hearing, and without legal authority, 
rendering them void ab initio under firmly established Texas and federal law. Burnaman v. 
Heaton, Browning v. Prostok, and In re E.R. compel the conclusion that these orders must be set 
aside. 
Meanwhile, the opposing counsel has functionally abandoned this litigation, reappearing 
only to obstruct emergency relief and to further delay resolution—despite having been formally 
challenged under Rule 12. All while the Relator has remained the sole advancing party, 
unopposed, with no adequate remedy by appeal. The lack of participation from the Real Party in 
Interest only sharpens the urgency: justice delayed here has become justice denied, not just for 
the Relator, but for the children at the center of this matter who have been stripped of stability, 
routine, and meaningful access to both parents. 
This Court has authority to intervene here. The Relator now invokes that authority, not 
for delay or advantage, but for protection of his rights, restoration of lawful process, and an end 
to the harm that has now metastasized through judicial inaction. 
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Relator Charles Dustin Myers respectfully 
prays that this Court: 
1. Grant this Emergency Motion for Relief, and immediately declare the subject orders 
void ab initio for lack of actual consent; 
2. Grant the concurrent mandamus in Relator’s favor, ordering the Respondent Judge to 
hold a hearing on the Emergency TRO it refused to hear on March 28, 2025 so that 
proper orders may be issued that suit the best interests of the children;

TO THE HONORABLE DAVID L. EVANS OF THE 8TH ADMINISTRATIVE 
JUDICIAL REGION OF TEXAS:  
This Court's impartiality is now irrevocably in question. The act of 
setting this case for final trial after sustaining over a year of irreparable harm while 
appellate proceedings remain unresolved is itself an act of partiality warranting 
mandatory recusal pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(b)(1) and 18b(b)(2) on the 
grounds that the partiality of the tribunal is reasonably in question, and there is a 
clear personal bias and prejudice exhibited towards the undersigned. 
I. TIMELINESS 
The timeliness of this motion comes three days before a scheduled court 
proceeding, which is intended to “set the case for final trial and to enter a pre-trial 
scheduling order”.(TAB A) However, this flies in the face of three concurrent 
mandamus proceedings pending before the Second Court of Appeals, which 
concurrently seek redress for 1) the refusal of Hon. Kate Stone to hear a properly 
filed emergency TRO (No. 02-25-00164-CV), to seek vacatur of the orders issued 
beyond the court’s jurisdiction by Hon. Jeff Kaitcer on March 14, 2024 (No. 02-25-
00166-CV), (TAB B) and to reverse an improper consolidation motion granted sua 
sponte by Hon. Kenneth Newell. (No. 02-25-00171-CV) All three mandamus 
petitions are at the en banc rehearing stage, except for cause number 02-25-00166-
CV which was denied per curiam on April 24, 2024.

TO THE HONORABLE DAVID L. EVANS OF THE 8!" ADMINISTRATIVE
JUDICIAL REGION OF TEXAS:

This Court's impartiality is now irrevocably in question. The act of
setting this case for final trial after sustaining over a year of irreparable harm while
appellate proceedings remain unresolved is itself an act of partiality warranting
mandatory recusal pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(b)(1) and 18b(b)(2) on the
grounds that the partiality of the tribunal is reasonably in question, and there is a
clear personal bias and prejudice exhibited towards the undersigned.

I. TIMELINESS

The timeliness of this motion comes three days before a scheduled court
proceeding, which is intended to “set the case for final trial and to enter a pre-trial
scheduling order’.(TAB A) However, this flies in the face of three concurrent
mandamus proceedings pending before the Second Court of Appeals, which
concurrently seek redress for 1) the refusal of Hon. Kate Stone to hear a properly

filed emergency TRO (No. 02-25-00164-CV), to seek vacatur of the orders issued

beyond the court’s jurisdiction by Hon. Jeff Kaitcer on March 14, 2024 (No. 02-25-
00166-CV), (TAB B) and to reverse an improper consolidation motion granted sua
sponte by Hon. Kenneth Newell. (No. 02-25-00171-CV) All three mandamus

petitions are at the en banc rehearing stage, except for cause number (2-25-00 166-

CV which was denied per curiam on April 24, 2024.

Despite the upcoming setting, the exception pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 
18a(b)(1)(B)(i) applies. The act of scheduling this matter for final trial itself 
constitutes grounds for recusal by casting doubt upon the tribunal's impartiality. 
The undersigned could not have anticipated that this final trial setting would 
suddenly arise amidst ongoing appellate proceedings, especially given that the case 
has remained inactive since September of 2024. 
Significantly, the opposing party has only recently re-engaged with the case 
after emergency relief was requested by the undersigned in the 233rd District Court 
due to the continuing harm inflicted upon him and his children by these unresolved 
issues. Thus, this abrupt effort to proceed with final trial under the prevailing 
circumstances starkly demonstrates judicial bias, further reinforcing the necessity 
of recusal at this juncture. 
II. PRIOR RECUSAL 
The undersigned must also note that this marks the second recusal motion 
filed in this case, the first occurring on October 7, 2024, which was denied on 
November 7, 2024, by visiting retiring Justice Gabriel.(TAB C) The motion was 
denied stating a “failure to appear”, however, all parties agreed to reset the case to 
a later due to a dental emergency sustained by the undersigned.(TAB D) There was 
no mention of this emergency in the order. Finally, it wasn’t until over four months 
later that the judges were reinstated back into the case, because the undersigned

had to remind the court coordinator when seeking a ruling on his still un-opposed 
summary judgement that’s been on the docket since February 22, 2024, to reinstate 
Hon. Munford and Hon. Kaitcer.(TAB E) Had the undersigned not proactively 
reached out, there wasn’t any indication that the reinstatement would have 
occurred. 
III. PROCEDURE 
 
The correct procedural framework required in these proceedings, particularly 
considering the irregular handling of prior matters, must be restated here: 
First, pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(e)(1), “…the clerk of the court must 
immediately deliver a copy to the respondent judge and to the presiding judge of 
the administrative judicial region in which the court is located.” Therefore, the 
undersigned formally objects to any handling from the court coordinator 
regarding these proceedings. In the prior matter there were amended referrals, 
modified pleadings, and an otherwise straightforward process became ambiguous. 
(TAB F) 
Second, pursuant to Id. 18a(e)(2): “[w]hen a respondent judge signs and 
files an order of recusal or referral, the clerk of the court must immediately deliver 
a copy to the regional presiding judge.” The same applies here as to point one. No 
disrespect is intended; this assertion is made solely insofar as the governing statute 
confers no such authority to court coordinators.

Third, pursuant to Id. 18a(g)(6)(C), the undersigned respectfully requests 
that this matter be set for hearing by telephone at the earliest practicable time, 
considering the undersigned’s current financial hardship and lack of stable 
residence. The nature and complexity of the underlying issues are not easily 
reducible to writing, which is precisely why this matter has suffered from 
prolonged procedural silence rather than meaningful discussion grounded in the 
record. A telephonic hearing is necessary to afford the Court a clearer 
understanding of the facts and to ensure due process is meaningfully observed. 
Fourth, should this motion be granted, the undersigned respectfully requests 
that this case be reassigned to an entirely different judicial district, given that both 
the 233rd and 322nd District Courts are presided over by judges directly 
implicated in the procedural and constitutional irregularities described herein. 
Fifth, if the Honorable Regional Presiding Judge chooses to refer this 
motion, the undersigned requests that the alternative language of Id.18a(g)(1) be 
exercised so that the motion may be referred to the Chief Justice of the Supreme 
Court of Texas given the circumstances of this matter, as explained in more detail 
below. 
Finally, pursuant to Id. 18a(f)(1)(A), the undersigned respectfully urges the 
Honorable James B. Munford to voluntarily recuse himself in order to avoid 
further delay and to restore confidence in the fair and impartial administration of

justice, or in the alternative, vacate the March 14, 2024 orders for want of 
consent, and set cause number #322-744263-23 for a pre-trial conference no 
later than 14-days from the decision, effectively rendering moot these recusal 
proceeding.  
The persistent and unexplained judicial inaction—particularly in the face of 
repeated requests for emergency relief—has caused ongoing, irreparable harm to 
the undersigned and his minor children. Such circumstances are fundamentally 
incompatible with both the due process protections guaranteed by law and the best 
interest standard governing all family law proceedings in this State. There is no 
logic in proceeding to final trial in the current circumstance. One party cannot 
unilaterally decide the matter, especially when they remain silent in the face of 
serious, un-rebutted allegations.   
IV. GROUNDS FOR RECUSAL 
A. STANDARD FOR RECUSAL 
A motion to recuse is the appropriate procedural mechanism to challenge a 
judge’s impartiality. Sanchez v. State, 926 S.W.2d 391, 394 (Tex. App.—El Paso 
1996, pet. ref’d). Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(a), any party may file 
a verified motion stating with particularity the grounds upon which the presiding 
judge should not sit.

In addition to the statutory bases for recusal, the Due Process Clause of the 
Fourteenth Amendment provides an independent constitutional floor: recusal is 
required where the probability of actual bias is too high to be constitutionally 
tolerable. Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U.S. 868, 872 (2009) (citing 
Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U.S. 35, 47 (1975)). That standard is met where, under the 
totality of circumstances, a judge’s continued participation creates an unacceptable 
risk of bias—whether due to prior involvement, one-sided procedures, or 
unchecked discretion applied to the detriment of one party. 
Here, the cumulative record demonstrates a pattern of prejudice, one-sided 
decision-making, and disregard for both procedure and fundamental rights, rising 
well beyond the constitutional threshold described in Caperton. Recusal is not 
merely appropriate—it is required, as explained below. 
B. BIAS 
The level of bias against the undersigned started on day one. Without any 
factual basis, without holding an evidentiary hearing, and without eliciting any 
testimony from the Petitioner, the undersigned was ordered to vacate the residence 
that same day. (TAB F) No protective order was ever issued, no findings of family 
violence were made, even though Tex. Fam. Code §§ 83.006 and 85.001 plainly 
require such findings.

This decision, even though temporarily, severed the parent-child relationship 
without any lawful basis. The Family Code’s strict requirements were ignored. Tex. 
Fam. Code § 83.006(a) permits exclusion of a party from the home only if (1) the 
applicant files an affidavit describing facts requiring exclusion, and (2) appears at 
the hearing to testify to those facts. Section 83.006(b) further requires that the court 
make three findings: (i) the applicant resides (or recently resided) at the premises, 
(ii) the other party committed family violence within the past 30 days, and (iii) 
there is a clear and present danger of future family violence. 
The only thing before the court were allegations of family violence, which 
were never substantiated. Rather, they were leveraged into a settlement agreement 
that removed the children from their own home in February of 2024. (TAB G) A 
court cannot sever a parent-child bond on mere allegations. Tex. Fam Code 
153.002. Yet here, that’s what has occurred, and the undersigned has sought 
answers from this court – and has received nothing but complete silence.  
Now, over fourteen months later, a facially invalid consent judgement has 
been permitted to destroy the lives of not only the undersigned – but his children, 
all while enabling the Petitioner, MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS, to get away 
with her deliberate scheme to undermine the judiciary that remains un-opposed on 
the face of the record. A cursory glance at page 1 versus page 38 of an excerpt of

repugnant to both the Texas and U.S. Constitutions, which guarantee that no citizen 
shall be deprived of liberty or property except by the due course of the law of the 
land. Here, Respondent was deprived of liberty and property interests without 
lawful procedures or any adjudication of wrongdoing, in violation these 
fundamental protections. U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. Further, no equal 
protection or due course of law has been afforded to the undersigned, 
demonstrating further unexplained bias, in violation of Tex. Const. art. I, §§ 3, 19. 
C. PREJUDICIAL DOCKET MANAGEMENT 
A court has the inherent authority to control its own docket. See Ho v. 
University of Texas at Arlington, 984 S.W.2d 672, 694-95 (Tex.App.-Amarillo 
1998, pet. denied) Whether a reasonable period has lapsed in which to rule on a 
pending matter is dependent on the circumstances of each case. Ex parte Bates, 65 
S.W.3d 133, 134-35 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2001, orig. proceeding). Other factors 
considered in determining whether a reasonable time has passed are the state of the 
trial court's docket and other judicial and administrative duties that must be 
addressed. In re Villarreal, 96 S.W.3d 708, 711 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2003, orig. 
proceeding). 
Here, in this matter, the undersigned has dispositive motions on the docket 
that would afford him the much-needed relief, yet the court chooses to prioritize 
motions that favor the opposition. For example, the oldest sitting motion is a

A court has the inherent authority to control its own docket. See Ho v.
University of Texas at Arlington, 984 S.W.2d 672, 694-95 (Tex.App.-Amarillo
1998, pet. denied) Whether a reasonable period has lapsed in which to rule on a
pending matter is dependent on the circumstances of each case. Ex parte Bates, 65
S.W.3d 133, 134-35 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2001, orig. proceeding). Other factors
considered in determining whether a reasonable time has passed are the state of the
trial court's docket and other judicial and administrative duties that must be
addressed. In re Villarreal, 96 S.W.3d 708, 711 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2003, orig.

proceeding).

Here, in this matter, the undersigned has dispositive motions on the docket
that would afford him the much-needed relief, yet the court chooses to prioritize
motions that favor the opposition. For example, the oldest sitting motion is a

Motion for Summary Judgement filed on Feb 22, 2024, seeking to defeat the 
baseless claims of violence that were raised him at the onset of this case.  
Next, there exists a pending Rule 12 Motion challenging COOPER L. 
CARTER’s authority, counsel for Petitioner in this matter. Despite this, she 
interrupted emergency proceedings in the 233rd District Court, leading to the 
mandamus proceedings that neither the tribunal nor opposing side has participated 
in, but continues to act sua sponte to give the illusion of an adequate remedy for an 
appeal when the threshold issues remain.  
Finally, there exists a pending DWOP motion and motion to compel 
discovery on the docket, pending for several months – unaddressed – showing no 
respect for the process by the opposing side. In In re Conner, 458 S.W.3d 532 (Tex. 
2015) the Texas Supreme Court’s statement that "conclusive presumption of 
abandonment" that arises from unexplained delays indicates that judges must 
actively manage their dockets to prevent such delays or ensure that they are 
adequately explained. Here, there is no explanation for the delays and inaction. The 
opposition has no incentive to move the case forward, as they were awarded on all 
core issues at the onset of the case – for reasons yet to be explained.  
The only party seeking any form of relief has been the undersigned. 
Authorities not only establish judicial responsibility for docket management but 
also provide examples of judges proactively fulfilling this responsibility rather than

blaming litigants for delays. The actions of the Galveston County district judges 
described in Armentrout v. Murdock, 779 S.W.2d 119 (Tex. App. 
1989) and Southern Pacific Transp. Co. v. Stoot, 530 S.W.2d 930 (Tex. 
1975) exemplify this approach. These judges "recognized this problem, took 
responsibility for the condition of their dockets, and moved against the troubles of 
delay" by instituting systems to ensure timely case progression. This example 
demonstrates that effective judges take ownership of their dockets rather than 
deflecting responsibility. 
The responsibility of judges for docket management is further emphasized 
by the accountability measures in place. In re Rose, 144 S.W.3d 661 (Tex. 
2004) demonstrates that judges can face disciplinary action for administrative 
misconduct, including failures related to court management. Judge Rose's own 
acknowledgment that "the responsibility is mine" and "I'm the bottom line" reflects 
the understanding within the judiciary itself that judges bear ultimate responsibility 
for their courts' functioning. 
A plea to the jurisdiction has been filed as of April 24, 2025, to serve as 
another reminder to the court that these orders must be vacated as a matter of law, 
not finalized into finality. (TAB H)

The record in this case reveals a sustained pattern of judicial favoritism 
toward opposing counsel, warranting recusal. In Sun Exploration & Production 
Co. v. Jackson, 783 S.W.2d 202, 204 (Tex. 1989), the Texas Supreme Court 
acknowledged that while individual rulings may not rise to the level of reversible 
error, an appellate court may nonetheless detect from the record a clear pattern of 
favoritism that undermines the appearance of impartiality. 
Recusal is required where such favoritism would cause a reasonable 
observer to doubt the judge’s neutrality. Here the level of favoritism is so high that 
the courts below improperly grant motions sua-sponte without hearings to the 
Petitioner’s benefit, when the same is done to the undersigned to his detriment. As 
the court explained in Guillen v. Cameron County, No. 13-16-00682-CV (Tex. 
App.—Corpus Christi–Edinburg Nov. 15, 2018, no pet.): 
“Recusal is appropriate if a reasonable member of the public at large, 
knowing all the facts in the public domain concerning the judge’s conduct, would 
harbor doubts as to the judge’s impartiality.” That standard is met here. An 
objective observer reviewing the docket would see: 
i. A mother who conducted a deliberate scheme to defraud the judiciary and 
pursue an extramarital affair; 
ii. A father ordered out of his home and children’s daily lives without any 
findings or evidentiary hearing;

iii. A consistent pattern of orders favoring one party while leaving the pro se

remain silent in briefing, only to appear at hearing and object, is both prejudicial 
and professionally improper. Such conduct should not be condoned by the Court, 
particularly when it operates to the detriment of a self-represented parent seeking 
long-delayed relief.  
CONCLUSION  
 
Imagine being labeled a criminal—accused of abuse—while a court is told 
that a protective order already exists against you. Imagine that the very person you 
supported for years and who benefitted from your success suddenly claims 
financial indigence, asserts full responsibility for all expenses, and serves you—at 
Christmas—with allegations designed to remove you from your home, your 
children, and your livelihood. Now imagine this: You built a business from home—
intentionally, strategically—so that you could raise your children and be a present 
father, not just a provider. You tailored your entire life around being there for them. 
Now imagine the State—without lawful authority—rips that life away. No 
hearing. No findings. No emergency. No evidence. And then the State does 
nothing. It sits on its hands while you fight, alone, for over fifteen months—
pleading for relief, receiving only silence. And the reason? There isn’t one that 
can be traced to the record, meaning it must be extrajudicial and derived from 
actual bias. There exists no basis for the current orders to remain in effect, yet they 
are. The court chooses to act sua sponte only when it benefits the opposing party.

In a world where you take the initiative of showing up, ready to defend 
yourself—your family, your home, your rights—only for those rights to be stripped 
away in the blink of an eye before being afforded the chance to defend yourself. 
No process. No fairness. No law.  
Is that how justice works? Is that how a divorce should begin? Because that 
is exactly what happened here. This is more than a denial of due process. This is 
a system abandoning its core duty to protect children and uphold the law. This 
is a constitutional wound—one that continues to bleed with every day this court 
refuses to act. This recusal must be granted as a matter of law—not just to restore 
fairness, but to prevent this travesty from becoming permanent. Each day this 
continues is another day of unexplained, avoidable suffering inflicted on the 
children at the center of this case while the opposing side sits in silence. The court 
has an obligation to conduct their operations within the bounds of the law and 
protect the family unit. Here, this court took no issue in destroying it from the 
onset. 
Therefore, notwithstanding the docket management and favoritism displayed 
towards the opposing party, the pattern of rulings alone showcases a deep-seated 
favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible. Dow Chem.

Subject: RE: Today's hearing at 11 CL-12105
Dear Ms. Baker, and Mr. Carter,
I am writing to respectfully request a rescheduling of today’s recusal hearing due to an unexpected medical issue. Late
last night, I began experiencing severe tooth pain, which has now escalated to significant facial swelling and intense
discomfort. The pain is currently affecting my ability to speak, eat, and focus, making it challenging to fully participate in
today’s proceedings.
Specifically, it's my bottom left molar which the nerve is open and exposed causing significant pain. 
I want to sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, especially given the efforts the court has made to
accommodate this hearing. Please know that this request is made only out of necessity, and I deeply regret the timing as
I would prefer to move the case forward.
This request comes with a high degree of reluctance given the unexpected technical difficulties experienced last time and
would not be making it if it wasn't absolutely necessary.
Thank you all for your understanding and consideration. I am committed to continuing with the hearing at the earliest
possible opportunity as I am eager to move the case forward.
I wanted to inform the court as soon as possible out of respect for the courts busy schedule.
I currently am unable to locate the case on research texas, as I've been trying to file a formal notice but given the time I
wanted to ensure the court was made aware as soon as possible of the situation.
Lines of communication are open for further discussion or if any further information is needed.
With respect,
Charles Myers

Hey, | started experiencing
massive pain in my bottom
left molar last night. |
informed the court and
apparently the coordinator
is out with covid. I'm gonna
have to go to the dentist
and see what | can do, so

| just wanted to let you
know because the girls are
excited about urban air
today. There's just no way..

but | can make it up to them
another day when I'm not in

excruciating pain.

08:21AM @

| informed cooper but
wanted to ensure everyone
was aware. Called the court
but no answer. Sent email.

Ms. Baker,

My Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, filed February 22, 2024, remains unopposed for over a year. Under TRCP
166a(c) and Local Rule 4.01(d), this motion is ripe for ruling. Opposing counsel's failure to respond waives any objection.

Further, opposing counsel (CC'ed here), cannot prosecute her case in accordance with Texas law, and still has an
outstanding rule 12 motion that is now also unopposed.

Agranting of either motion would resolve the core case issues, and given the circumstances, is duly warranted.
| formally request an immediate ruling or confirmation of when the Court will act. Further delay is unacceptable.

If the judges cannot legally act given opposing counsels failure to comply with Tex. R. CIV. P. 237a, then the matter should
be brought before David L. Evans without delay.

Sincerely,

Charles Dustin Myers

Mr. Dustin:

Prior to providing available dates to set your hearing request, the Court must know how much time you are
requesting for the hearing? Further, you must E-file or personally appear with a Notice of Hearing for the
Court to set the hearing.

Thank you,

If you received a Notice of Dismissal, you MUST file a Motion to Retain. The Motion
MUST be SET, HEARD and concluded with a SIGNED ORDER TO RETAIN.

M.1833 DO NOT EMAIL ME FOR A SETTING REGARDING THE DWOP. M.1833

Hello Lindsey,

| hope you are doing well. | am following up on the Myers v. Myers matter (Cause No. 322-744263-23 in the 322nd District
Court), which was remanded back from federal court on December 17, 2024. As of today, the opposing party still has not
filed the Notice of Remand or otherwise re-engaged with the case. This has left our case in limbo on the court’s docket. In
the meantime, Charles Dustin Myers (Respondent), is suffering ongoing harm each day without the court’s intervention on
pending matters.

To recap the situation briefly:

The federal court remanded the case to state court on 12/17/2024. Under Texas Rule 237a, it was Petitioner’s
responsibility to file the remand order with the clerk and notify us. That never happened. We are now three months post-
M..183%#"4, and the case has not been officially re-docketed due to this oversight. M.1834

Mbd839..16 PM Gmail - Ruling Requested — Unopposed Summary Judgment (Filed 2/22/2024) — Case No. 322-744263-23 M.1835

| have multiple pending motions that were filed before and after the remand. Critically, Petitioner and her counsel have not
responded to ANY of these motions. For example, the Motion for Summary Judgment (filed 2/26/2024) received no
response. More urgently, our Ex Parte Motion for Child Custody, Exclusive Use of Marital Residence, Contempt, and
Sanctions (filed 2/12/2025) remains unopposed and unaddressed. We also filed a Proposed Order on 2/20/2025 and a
Request for Immediate Ruling on 2/28/2025, with no response from the other side.

The issues in that ex parte motion are time-sensitive and critical: we need a court order for custody and to regain access
to the marital home. Opposing counsel’s failure to follow procedure has effectively stalled relief that desperately needs
attention. (Respondent has been without access to his home and children for an extended period through no fault of his
own). There are also allegations of contempt by the opposing party that have not been heard because of these delays.

Given this extraordinary situation, we respectfully ask the Court to take immediate action. Specifically, we request one of
the following at the Court’s earliest convenience (and we truly mean as soon as possible, even this week if feasible):

Immediate ruling/signing of orders: Since the motions are unopposed, the Court can rule on them without a hearing. |
have a proposed Order for the ex parte motion ready for Judge Kaitcer’s signature. | urge the Court to sign an order
granting Respondent temporary custody of the children and exclusive use of the residence immediately. This would
provide much-needed stability while the case proceeds. Similarly, the motion for summary judgment can be granted on
the papers, as no controverting evidence or response was ever filed by Petitioner.

Emergency hearing: If the Court prefers to hold a hearing, please provide the soonest possible date and time for an
emergency hearing on the Ex Parte Motion (2/12/2025), and a notice will be filed tomorrow. | am prepared to appear on
short notice. Given that the motion is unopposed, the hearing should be brief. Respondent will gladly testify to confirm the
facts if needed. He just needs the Court’s authorization to move forward — every day of delay is another day he is barred
from his home and children.

Filing of Remand Order: To remove any procedural barrier, Respondent will obtain a certified copy of the federal remand
order and he will file it himself (or hand-deliver a copy) to the Court. If the clerk needs that filed separately to officially
reopen the case, please let me know - it will be done immediately. | do not want a clerical formality to stand between the
children and justice any longer.

Sanctions for non-compliance (if appropriate): Resppndent also wants the Court to be aware that opposing counsel’s
conduct — failing to file the remand notice and ignoring court filings — is sanctionable. While the priority is getting relief for
the children, the intent is to address this issue at the appropriate time. For now, this failure should at least not be
rewarded by further delaying proceedings. Respondent shouldn’t have to wait indefinitely due to the other side’s
procedural neglect.

In sum, Respondent is asking for the Court’s help to break the logjam created by the opposing party. Our requests are
straightforward and unopposed. The court has the authority to grant the relief either ex parte or by default given the
circumstances. Respondent is simply requesting that the Court exercise that authority as soon as possible to prevent
further irreparable harm.

My tone in this email is urgent because the situation is urgent. | have been exceedingly patient while trying every avenue
to move this case forward. With each passing day, the situation worsens and the children at issue remain in uncertainty. |
trust that the 322nd District Court strives to resolve such matters fairly and expeditiously, and | am eager to assist in any
way to facilitate a prompt resolution.

Proposed next steps:

If Judge Kaitcer (or the assigned judge) is available to review the file tomorrow, we urge him to sign the proposed Order
(filed 2/20/2025) granting the relief in the 2/12/2025 motion. | am available by phone or email if the Court has any
questions or slight modifications to the order.

Alternatively, please provide a setting for an emergency hearing as early as possible. Even a telephone or Zoom hearing
would be acceptable, given the urgency, if that would expedite the process. A notice of hearing will be filed Monday.

If there are any concerns about the procedural posture (such as the missing Notice of Remand), please let me know. | am
prepared to cure any such issue immediately. | can file the remand order and serve opposing counsel (to the extent she
will accept service) to remove any doubt that the case is properly before the Court.

Thank you very much for your time and attention to this matter, Lindsey. | understand the Court has a busy docket, but
this case has unusual circumstances that warrant special handling. | greatly appreciate any assistance you can provide in
conveying the urgency of this situation to Judge Kaitcer, Judge Munford, or in the alternative, Judge Evans. | am hopeful
that, with the Court’s intervention, we can obtain a ruling or hearing in a matter of days, bringing much-needed relief and
allowing the case to progress.

ALL motions must be set for a hearing. If you are requesting relief from the Court, you must provide the
Court with a formal Notice of Court Proceeding to set each of your E-filed motions. | also informed you of
this in my previous email response. | will take no further action responding to your email communications
unless you are requesting an in person hearing AND provide the Court with a E-filed Notice of Court
Proceeding in compliance with the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Please refer to the Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure, The Texas Family Code, and the Tarrant County Family Court’s Local Rules.

The 322" District Court and Associate Court hears ALL matters in person and not by submission.

Dear Ms. Baker,

Thanks for your response.

As | previously pointed out, the Order of Assignment from Judge David L. Evans assigned Justice Lee Gabriel to the case.
That assignment remains in effect until Judge Evans issues a written termination order, as stated. To my knowledge, no
such order has been issued or served.

Until that occurs, it would be procedurally improper to request a court hearing, particularly given that the opposing party
has yet to fulfill their obligation under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 237a by filing a Notice of Remand after removal to
federal court.

It would be helpful if these issues could be resolved as soon as possible so that the case can proceed effectively.

Best regards,
Charles Dustin Myers

IN THE 322nd DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
TO THE HONORABLE JAMES MUNFORD: 
The record reveals a pattern of the Court acting beyond its jurisdiction: on January 16, 
2024, the Court ousted Respondent from the marital residence without any finding of family 
violence or protective order; on March 26, 2024, the Court entered “Agreed” Temporary 
Orders without Respondent’s consent, flouting the statutory procedures for entry of such 
orders. These actions violate Respondent’s due process rights and the Texas Family Code. Under 
Texas law, orders issued without jurisdiction or in the absence of a party’s consent are void 
and cannot confer jurisdiction. Respondent asks the Court to recognize these fundamental defects 
and dismiss the current orders as a matter of law. 
Until these orders are resolved, or the court issues written findings regarding their 
legitimacy, Respondent will not appear and risk further deprivation of his rights from this court.

I. INTRODUCTION
Petitioner filed a divorce petition under Title 5 of the Texas Family Code on December 
18, 2023. That petition did not seek exclusive possession of the residence or ask that Respondent 
be excluded from the home. Shortly thereafter, on December 22, 2023, Petitioner filed a separate 
Application for Protective Order under Title 4 of the Family Code, in which she explicitly 
requested exclusive possession of the home, removal of Respondent, and child support. The 
Court consolidated the protective‐order case into the divorce case.  
On January 16, 2024, the court—without holding an evidentiary hearing or finding family 
violence—entered Temporary Orders granting Petitioner exclusive possession of the home and 
primary custody and child support, and requiring Respondent to vacate the residence that same 
day. No protective order was ever issued and no findings of family violence were made, even 
though Tex. Fam. Code §§ 83.006 and 85.001 plainly require such findings. In the weeks that 
followed, the court continued these arrangements and ultimately entered “Agreed” Temporary 
Orders (March 26, 2024) allocating parenting time and support. All of these extreme orders were 
based solely on Petitioner’s Title 4 application (and allegations of family violence), and no 
amendments to the pleadings were ever filed to convert the case into a Title 5 SAPCR. 
Respondent never received any notice or hearing on custody, possession, or support issues under 
Title 5. 
II. Legal Standards
The trial court’s authority is strictly limited by the statutes and pleadings. It may consider 
only the claims and relief expressly pleaded by the parties, and must follow the Family Code’s 
procedures for protective orders and SAPCRs. Subject‐matter jurisdiction is a threshold issue: if

I. INTRODUCTION

Petitioner filed a divorce petition under Title 5 of the Texas Family Code on December
18, 2023. That petition did not seek exclusive possession of the residence or ask that Respondent
be excluded from the home. Shortly thereafter, on December 22, 2023, Petitioner filed a separate
Application for Protective Order under Title 4 of the Family Code, in which she explicitly
requested exclusive possession of the home, removal of Respondent, and child support. The

Court consolidated the protective-order case into the divorce case.

On January 16, 2024, the court—without holding an evidentiary hearing or finding family
violence—entered Temporary Orders granting Petitioner exclusive possession of the home and
primary custody and child support, and requiring Respondent to vacate the residence that same
day. No protective order was ever issued and no findings of family violence were made, even
though Tex. Fam. Code §§ 83.006 and 85.001 plainly require such findings. In the weeks that

Title 5.

Il. Legal Standards

The trial court’s authority is strictly limited by the statutes and pleadings. It may consider
only the claims and relief expressly pleaded by the parties, and must follow the Family Code’s

procedures for protective orders and SAPCRs. Subject-matter jurisdiction is a threshold issue: if

M.1850

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the court acted beyond the law, its orders are void. A plea to the jurisdiction is decided as a 
matter of law when the relevant facts are undisputed (see Tex. Dep’t of Parks & Wildlife v. 
Miranda, 133 S.W.3d 217, 228 (Tex. 2004)). Here, the material jurisdictional facts are not in 
dispute. 
III. Title 4 (Protective Order) Proceedings Cannot Support Custody or Support 
Under Texas law, a protective‐order proceeding (Title 4) is not a custody (SAPCR) 
proceeding (Title 5). The San Antonio Court of Appeals recently reaffirmed that without a proper 
SAPCR petition under Title 5, a court may not award conservatorship, possession, or support. In 
Rivera v. Figueroa (Tex. App.–San Antonio 2019), the court held that orders issued in a 
protective‐order case cannot support conservatorship or child‐support relief unless a Title 5 
petition was filed and noticed. Likewise, In re Sheffield, 639 S.W.2d 270 (Tex. App.–Dallas 
1982), long held that Title 4 and Title 5 proceedings are jurisdictionally separate: “a court may 
not grant relief beyond the scope of the protective‐order statute without compliance with the 
SAPCR statutes” (sheffield, 639 S.W.2d at 272-73). Here, Petitioner’s December 22 Title 4 
application was never amended or converted into a Title 5 petition. Respondent never waived 
notice or a hearing on conservatorship/possession issues. The court’s decision to exclude 
Respondent from the home and divest him of custody on January 16, 2024 therefore had no 
jurisdictional basis. In short, “[w]ithout a valid protective order in place, the court lacked 
jurisdiction to continue enforcing the extreme relief originally granted”. 
IV. Statutory Prerequisites for Exclusion and Protective Orders Were Not Met 
Even if the court treated the relief as a protective‐order, the Family Code’s strict 
requirements were ignored. Tex. Fam. Code § 83.006(a) permits exclusion of a party from the

Under Texas law, a protective-order proceeding (Title 4) is not a custody (SAPCR)
proceeding (Title 5). The San Antonio Court of Appeals recently reaffirmed that without a proper
SAPCR petition under Title 5, a court may not award conservatorship, possession, or support. In

=== PAGE 81 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
home only if (1) the applicant files a sworn affidavit describing facts requiring exclusion, and (2) 
appears at the hearing to testify on those facts. Section 83.006(b) further requires that the court 
make three findings: (i) the applicant resides (or recently resided) at the premises, (ii) the other 
party committed family violence within the past 30 days, and (iii) there is a clear and present 
danger of future family violence. Likewise, § 85.001(a) mandates that at the close of a 
protective‐order hearing, the court must explicitly find whether family violence occurred. If so, 
the court “shall” issue a protective order against the perpetrator. In this case, none of these 
prerequisites were satisfied. Petitioner did file an application and affidavit, but no hearing on 
January 16 (or thereafter) produced any finding of family violence. The court did not issue a 
protective order as the statute requires, and instead simply extended the eviction and custody 
restrictions indefinitely. By failing to hold a hearing, make any family‐violence finding, or enter 
a protective order, the court “bypass[ed] the statutory prerequisites” entirely. Without those 
statutorily required findings, the January 16 “kick‐out” and custody order was outside the court’s 
power. 
V. All Orders Exceeding the Pleadings or Statutory Authority Are Void
It is a bedrock rule that a Texas court must confine its rulings to the relief requested by 
the pleadings and authorized by statute. Any order beyond that scope is void. The Houston First 
Court of Appeals has stated that “[a]n order purporting to grant relief beyond the pleadings is 
void ab initio”. In Guillory v. Boykins, 442 S.W.3d 682, 690 (Tex. App.–Houston [1st Dist.] 
2014, no pet.), the court held that where a trial court lacks jurisdiction or statutory authority to 
grant the relief, the order is void. Similarly, In re P.M.G., 405 S.W.3d 406, 416–17 (Tex. App.–
Texarkana 2013, no pet.), confirms that orders entered without pleadings or outside statutory 
scope are null. Here, not only did the protective‐order pleadings not include any SAPCR claims,

home only if (1) the applicant files a sworn affidavit describing facts requiring exclusion, and (2)
appears at the hearing to testify on those facts. Section 83.006(b) further requires that the court
make three findings: (i) the applicant resides (or recently resided) at the premises, (11) the other
party committed family violence within the past 30 days, and (iii) there is a clear and present
danger of future family violence. Likewise, § 85.001(a) mandates that at the close of a
protective-order hearing, the court must explicitly find whether family violence occurred. If so,
the court “shall” issue a protective order against the perpetrator. In this case, none of these
prerequisites were satisfied. Petitioner did file an application and affidavit, but no hearing on
January 16 (or thereafter) produced any finding of family violence. The court did not issue a
protective order as the statute requires, and instead simply extended the eviction and custody
restrictions indefinitely. By failing to hold a hearing, make any family-violence finding, or enter
a protective order, the court “bypass[ed] the statutory prerequisites” entirely. Without those
statutorily required findings, the January 16 “kick-out” and custody order was outside the court’s

power.

V. All Orders Exceeding the Pleadings or Statutory Authority Are Void

It is a bedrock rule that a Texas court must confine its rulings to the relief requested by
the pleadings and authorized by statute. Any order beyond that scope is void. The Houston First
Court of Appeals has stated that “[a]n order purporting to grant relief beyond the pleadings is
void ab initio”. In Guillory v. Boykins, 442 S.W.3d 682, 690 (Tex. App.—Houston [Ist Dist. ]
2014, no pet.), the court held that where a trial court lacks jurisdiction or statutory authority to
grant the relief, the order is void. Similarly, Jn re PM.G., 405 S.W.3d 406, 416-17 (Tex. App.—
Texarkana 2013, no pet.), confirms that orders entered without pleadings or outside statutory

scope are null. Here, not only did the protective-order pleadings not include any SAPCR claims,

but the later “agreed” orders on March 26, 2024 were not signed or even consented to by 
Respondent (violating Tex. R. Civ. P. 11). In short, every custody and exclusion order in this case 
was “predicated on a void order”. As the Second Court of Appeals recognized in In re C.L., 933 
S.W.2d 402, 405 (Tex. App.–Fort Worth 1996, no writ), an order that is void ab initio “cannot 
form the basis for any valid subsequent judgment”.  That’s exactly what is happening here. The 
court is now moving to finalize fraud, constitutional deprivation, and is trying to finalize its’ 
original excision of Respondent’s constitutional rights. The court cannot destroy a family and 
then move to finalize that without a lawful basis, and over orders that are fundamentally void. 
IV. Violation of Respondent’s Constitutional Rights to Due Process and Family Integrity 
The trial court’s actions not only violated statute but also trampled Respondent’s 
fundamental constitutional rights. By evicting the Respondent from his home and effectively 
separating him from his children with no prior notice or opportunity to be heard, the court 
deprived him of liberty and property without due process of law. This violates Article I, § 19 of 
the Texas Constitution (the “due course of law” guarantee) and the Fourteenth Amendment to 
the U.S. Constitution. Now, the court seeks to finalize this fundamental error amidst an ongoing 
appeal, showing a continuous and complete disregard for the Respondent’s rights.  
A. Deprivation of Property Without Due Process 
The January 16 order forced Respondent to vacate his own home on the same day it was 
issued. A person’s right to occupy their home is a significant property interest, protected by due 
process. Yet Respondent was ousted immediately, with no notice that such relief would be sought 
and no chance to contest the allegations. The Texas Constitution and the 14th Amendment both 
forbid the State from depriving any person of property without due process of law. Fuentes v. 
Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 81-82 (1972) (even temporary, non-final deprivations of property require

but the later “agreed” orders on March 26, 2024 were not signed or even consented to by

notice and hearing absent extraordinary circumstances). While Texas law does allow ex parte 
orders in truly exigent circumstances, those orders must be narrowly tailored and followed 
promptly by a full hearing. Here, the statutory requirements for an ex parte kick-out were 
disregarded, and Respondent was left homeless and separated from his belongings based on one-
sided assertions. This is precisely the kind of state action that due process is meant to guard 
against. 
B. Deprivation of Parental Rights Without Due Process 
Even more critically, the court’s orders infringed Respondent’s fundamental right to 
parent his children, also without due process. A parent’s interest in the care, custody, and control 
of their children is fundamental. The United States Supreme Court has recognized that “the 
interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children…is perhaps the oldest of the 
fundamental liberty interests recognized by this Court.” Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 
(2000) (plurality op.). Likewise, the Texas Supreme Court has affirmed that “the fundamental 
right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children” is 
constitutionally protected. In re C.J.C., 603 S.W.3d 804, 811 (Tex. 2020) (citing Troxel, 530 U.S. 
at 66). Governmental interference with this right is subject to strict scrutiny and must be 
accomplished only with rigorous procedural safeguards. 
Here, Respondent’s removal from the home effectively altered custody of the children 
without any hearing or finding of unfitness. Respondent went from being an equal managing 
conservator of the children to having zero possession or access (by virtue of being excluded from 
the home and the children’s presence) overnight and without notice. This is a profound 
deprivation of parental rights. As the U.S. Supreme Court held in Stanley v. Illinois, an unwed 
father could not be presumed unfit and have his children taken without a hearing – “the Due

Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that [a father] be given a hearing on 
his fitness as a parent before his children are removed from his custody.” Stanley v. Illinois, 405 
U.S. 645, 649 (1972) (emphasis added). The State “cannot, consistently with due process, 
merely presume” a parent’s unfitness or danger and bypass a hearing; “parental unfitness 
must be established on the basis of individualized proof” before a child is taken away. Id. at 
647, 649. Yet in Respondent’s case, the court did exactly what Stanley forbids – it presumed the 
necessity of removing the father, without any adversarial testing of the evidence or finding of 
actual misconduct and left the determination for later (a hearing that kept getting postponed). 
This violated Respondent’s procedural due process rights to be heard before being deprived of 
custody of his children. 
Moreover, the substantive aspect of due process was violated. There is a “strong 
presumption that the best interest of a child is served by remaining with a fit parent.” Troxel, 
530 U.S. at 68-69. The government may not “infringe on the fundamental right of parents to 
make child rearing decisions simply because a state judge believes a ‘better decision’ could 
be made.” Id. at 72 (plurality op.). In the absence of any evidence or finding that Respondent 
was an unfit or dangerous parent, removing his children from him was an arbitrary infringement 
on his fundamental liberty interest. The orders entered in this case prioritized a one-sided 
allegation over a father’s constitutional rights, in a manner repugnant to both the Texas and U.S. 
Constitutions. Article I, Section 19 of the Texas Constitution guarantees that no citizen shall be 
deprived of liberty or property except by the due course of the law of the land – here, 
Respondent was deprived of both without the lawful procedures or any adjudication of 
wrongdoing.

In sum, the process (or lack thereof) employed by the court fell far short of constitutional 
requirements. This constitutional infirmity is independently sufficient to render the court’s orders 
void. A judgment entered in violation of due process is void and subject to collateral attack. 
Peralta v. Heights Medical Center, Inc., 485 U.S. 80, 84-85 (1988) (judgment rendered without 
proper notice violates due process and is void). The proper remedy for a void order that stems 
from a due process violation is to declare it a nullity and dismiss any action that cannot proceed 
without it. 
VI. Plea to the Jurisdiction Must Be Granted
The undisputed record shows no factual or legal basis for the court’s jurisdiction over the 
extreme relief granted. Under Miranda v. Texas Dept. of Parks & Wildlife, a plea to the 
jurisdiction should be granted as a matter of law if the jurisdictional facts are undisputed or 
uncontroverted by competent evidence. Here, there is no genuine issue that (a) no protective 
order was issued and no findings of family violence were made, (b) no Title 5 SAPCR notice of 
hearing exists on the record, or was ever on file, and (c) all of Petitioner’s requests for home 
exclusion and support were styled under Title 4 and unsupported by any pleaded conservatorship 
claim. The court cannot “proceed further on the merits” without first resolving these fundamental 
defects. Because these jurisdictional defects are purely legal, a full evidentiary hearing is 
unnecessary – the Court should rule as a matter of law that it never had authority to enter any of 
the challenged orders, vacate them accordingly, and allow the status quo to reset. Additionally, 
the March 14, 2024, orders are a mere extension of the initial orders, which claim consent where 
consent is not present. These orders must be vacated as a matter of law as this court has no power 
to rule on void orders.

Respondent puts the court on notice that this plea serves as non-appearance notice in that 
he will not participate in any further proceedings until these issues are resolved in writing on the 
record, and will challenge any orders or decisions made prior to the resolution of these issues. 
VII. PRAYER
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Charles Dustin Myers respectfully prays that the 
Court: 
1. Rule, as a matter of law, that the January 16, 2024, exclusion and custody order and all
subsequent temporary orders are void ab initio for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction;
2. Vacate and rescind those orders, and dismiss with prejudice any custody, possession, or
support claims that rest on them; alternatively, dismiss all SAPCR claims for want of
proper pleadings, notice, and jurisdiction;
3. Issue a written ruling on this plea as required by law, and stay all further proceedings in
this case pending resolution of this jurisdictional challenge; and
4. Grant such other and further relief, at law or in equity, to which Respondent may be justly
entitled.

ISSUES PRESENTED FOR RECONSIDERATION 
 
Rehearing Issue No. 1: 
According to the Texas Supreme Court, a trial court cannot render a valid 
consent judgment when a party’s consent is absent at the time of rendition. 
The panel erred in issuing a per curiam denial that left undisturbed a facially 
invalid judgment. 
 
 
 
Rehearing Issue No. 2: 
According to the Texas Supreme Court, a judgment is void when the court 
rendering judgment has no jurisdiction of the parties or property, no 
jurisdiction of the subject matter, no jurisdiction to enter the judgment, or no 
capacity to act. The panel erred in issuing a per curiam denial that upheld a 
judgement in which the trial court had no capacity to act on.

FOREWORD 
“The Dragon in Triplicate” 
Relator CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS respectfully presents this motion for 
en banc reconsideration as the first in a trilogy of mandamus petitions, each 
receiving the same summary denial from the initial panel, which has given rise to 
what Relator calls “A Dragon in Triplicate”. 
But the Dragon is not the lower courts themselves nor the panel. The 
Dragon is the Real Party— whose procedural misrepresentations, tactical silence, 
and evasions of judicial review have spawned a procedural hydra. One flawed 
order gave rise to the next, and then another, until due process itself was obscured 
beneath the scales. 
The result is a tripartite error: a void order, a refusal to rule, and a 
consolidation entered without notice or consent — each reinforcing the next. Relief 
cannot be meaningfully granted unless each of these errors is severed in the correct 
sequence. 
Although Rule 52.8(d) of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure does not 
require an opinion be issued when denying relief, the panel’s per curiam denial 
here is irreconcilable with the undisputed facts in the record. Much like a hydra 
depicted in Greek mythology, this court can cauterize each individual head of this 
Dragon by imputing targeted relief lest each head regenerate unchecked.

TO THE HONORABLE SECOND COURT OF APPEALS: 
Relator CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS respectfully moves this Honorable 
Court for en banc reconsideration of the panel decisions rendered in three separate 
but interwoven mandamus proceedings to be presented for reconsideration in the 
following order: 
i.
Cause No. 02-25-00166-CV (denied April 14, 2025) (“Void Order”)
ii. Cause No. 02-25-00171-CV (denied April 17, 2025) (“Consolidation”)
iii. Cause No. 02-25-00164-CV (denied April 11, 2025) (“SAPCR/TRO”)
This motion serves as the first filed reconsideration and addresses the panel’s 
denial of Cause No. 02-25-00166-CV (attached as Tab 1), referred to as the “Void 
Order Mandamus”.   
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT 
Relator begins by demonstrating that this matter satisfies the standards for en 
banc reconsideration due to its extraordinary procedural posture, the 
interdependence of three concurrently pending motions, and the unique opportunity 
it presents for the Court to act as a unified body. The instant petition, as the first 
filed, serves as the natural point of entry for full court review. 
The panel’s per curiam denial is irreconcilable with the undisputed facts and 
procedural defects clearly reflected in the mandamus record. Resolution of this 
petition offers the Court an opportunity to simultaneously uphold Texas precedent 
across three distinct areas of family law: (1) void judgments, (2) procedural due

process, and (3) case consolidation. The totality of circumstances further invites 
consideration of broader legal doctrines and frameworks.  
Here, the question is whether the March 14, 2024, temporary orders are void 
or merely voidable. Relator contends that the face of the mandamus record 
conclusively demonstrates that the March 14, 2024, orders are void ab initio. As 
such, they are subject to collateral attack. These orders currently operate to deprive 
Relator of core constitutional and property rights, including access to his home, the 
ability to maintain and operate his business, and his conservatorship and possession 
rights over his minor children. Vacatur is necessary to eliminate these unlawful 
barriers to relief and to restore the status quo ante, pending adjudication of the 
subsequent en banc motions to be presented. 
ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITY 
I.
Although disfavored in routine matters, en banc reconsideration is
appropriate where the legal standard is met, as it is here.
En banc reconsideration is reserved for the rare case that satisfies one or 
both of the “hard-to-satisfy requirements” set forth in Texas Rule of Appellate 
Procedure 41.2(c): ensuring uniformity in the court’s decisions or addressing 
extraordinary circumstances. The Texas Supreme Court has endorsed this narrow 
standard, cautioning against overuse to preserve judicial efficiency and ensure that 
“the appellate trains... run on time.” See In re Marriage of Harrison, 507 S.W.3d 
259, 260–61 (Tex. App.—[14th Dist.] 2016) (Frost, J., dissenting).

This is precisely the kind of novel case that warrants en banc 
reconsideration, where the panel’s decision represents a fundamental oversight 
resulting in a departure from settled Texas law—made more urgent by the fact that 
the emergency relief sought was on behalf of two minor children and remains 
unopposed by any party at the time of filing this motion. 
Finally, this may be the first time in American legal history that three en 
banc reconsideration motions—each arising from separate appellate causes within 
a single-family law controversy—have been presented simultaneously. This 
posture affords the Court a singular opportunity to ensure uniformity in its rulings, 
reinforce established precedent, and restore confidence in the fair administration of 
justice.  
II. 
The panel’s per curiam denial conflicts with controlling authority and 
overlooks critical facts established in the mandamus record. 
 
Relator contends that the temporary orders signed on March 14, 2024, are 
facially invalid, violated the Relator’s due process rights, and were rendered by the 
trial court when it had no capacity to act. If true, Texas precedent would declare the 
orders void ab initio, a legal nullity from the very beginning. First, we address 
whether the orders are invalid by examining the Temporary Orders signed on 
March 14, 2024, by the trial court. 
A. The temporary orders are facially invalid for want of  
consent.

In Burnaman v. Heaton, the Texas Supreme Court held that “[w]hen a trial 
court has knowledge that one of the parties to a suit does not consent to a 
judgment, agreed to by his attorney, the trial court should refuse to give the 
agreement the sanction of the court so as to make it the judgment of the court. 
Id. 240 S.W.2d 288, 150 Tex. 333. Here, the orders in question (APP 1) reveal a 
departure from this precedent.  
 
On Page 1 of the orders, they expressly state that the consent of all parties 
has been given as evidenced by the signatures below. (APP 1.1). However, on page 
38 of the orders, the signatures of Relator and his prior counsel are missing. (APP 
1.38) under Burnaman, “[a] valid consent judgment cannot be rendered by a 
court when consent of one of the parties thereto is wanting.” The Relator’s missing 
signature is a prima facie showing that the temporary orders are, at the very least, 
invalid for want of consent.  
 
Compounding this issue is the fact that the orders were based on a February 
1 Associate Judge’s Report where the consent of the parties was memorialized by 
their signatures. However, even still - it is not sufficient to support the judgment 
that a party's consent thereto may at one time have been given; consent must exist 
at the very moment the court undertakes to make the agreement the judgment of 
the court. Id. The record conclusively demonstrates that consent was not present at 
the time of rendition. Supported by the case docket (MR 1), a cursory glance

reveals that the only appearance made by the Real Party came on January 16, 2024. 
In fact, the March 14 setting was set to hear Relator’s EMERGENCY MOTION 
TO VACATE evidenced by the NOTICE OF HEARING served on the parties (MR 
1.3 – #74) and the order denying the motion itself. (MR 16.1) Therefore, the orders 
are at the very least invalid. 
However, this defect doesn’t necessarily render the orders void ab initio, but 
instead voidable so long as the orders didn’t violate the Relator’s due process 
rights. The question is whether the trial court had the capacity to act. The Relator 
contends that it did not. 
B. The temporary orders issued on March 14, 2024, are void ab initio because
the trial court had no capacity to act when it rendered the orders, subjecting
them to collateral attack before this court.
In PNS Stores, Inc. v. Rivera 379 S.W.3d 267, 271–73 (Tex. 2012) the Texas 
Supreme Court discussed clarifying principles concerning important distinctions 
between void and voidable judgments and direct and collateral attacks. It is well 
settled that a litigant may attack a void judgment directly or collaterally, but a 
voidable judgment may only be attacked directly. Id. (citing Hagen v. Hagen, 282 
S.W.3d 899, 902 (Tex. 2009); Ramsey v. Ramsey, 19 S.W.3d 548, 552 (Tex. App.—
Austin2000, no pet.). A collateral attack seeks to avoid the binding effect of a 
judgment in order to obtain specific relief that the judgment currently impedes. Id.

seeks relief from the judgement entered by the trial court which has impeded his 
right to property, limited access to his minor children, and prevented him from 
conducting his normal business operations. Therefore, the orders must in fact be 
void in order for them to be collaterally attacked here.

Despite clear procedural and jurisdictional defects, the same judge who 
issued the March 14, 2024, orders disregarded his own directives and ordered 
Relator to sign orders to which he had never consented. (MR 16.1). The orders 
further misrepresent that a hearing on a motion for temporary orders occurred on 
February 1, 2024—yet there is no evidence such a motion was ever served on 
Relator, and the trial court’s docket does not comport with this statement . 
These are not technical deficiencies. They strike at the core of due process 
and judicial integrity. A judgment rendered without service, without hearing, and 
without consent is void—not voidable—and may be challenged at any time. In re 
E.R., __ S.W.3d __, __ (Tex. 2012). These orders must be declared void ab initio
and set aside accordingly. This Court need not resolve all three mandamus 
proceedings at once—but must begin with this one, the origin point of the 
procedural unraveling below 
CONCLUSION AND PRAYER 
With this prima facie showing of a void judgment and a corresponding abuse 
of discretion, the panel’s denial—issued without written explanation—raises 
serious concerns about uniformity, precedent, and due process. This Court now sits 
in a position to correct the record and prevent further harm by granting the relief 
requested.

Relator further advises the Court that the two remaining en banc 
reconsideration motions will be filed on or before April 23, 2025. If this Court 
continues to deny relief without substantive explanation while both trial courts and 
the Real Party remain silent, Relator will have no choice but to pursue additional 
litigation to vindicate his rights and preserve the rule of law. 
Relator respectfully prays that this Court grant the instant motion for en banc 
reconsideration, issue writ relief vacating the March 14, 2024, temporary orders, 
and stay all further trial court proceedings related to those orders pending 
resolution of the forthcoming motions—so that Relator’s fundamental rights may 
be promptly restored and the appellate process given meaningful effect. Relator has 
been barred from his residence, prevented from performing his normal business 
occupation, and has had the custody, care, and control over his minor children 
limited for 410 days without a single response from the opposing side. 
The Dragon in Triplicate—each addressing a distinct but compounding 
judicial failure – presents a rare opportunity for this Honorable Court. Only by 
addressing this first head as an entry point can the Court begin to remedy the 
procedural and constitutional breakdown that has taken root below. Relator prays 
for any further relief entitled to him by law.

IN THE 233RD DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
1. Texas law does generally require consolidation of divorce and custody matters to 
avoid conflicting parallel litigation. Under Family Code § 6.407, if a SAPCR involving the child 
is already pending in one court when a divorce is filed in another court, the SAPCR must be 
transferred to the divorce court so that one judge handles everything. Likewise, if the parents 
are in the middle of a divorce, any new custody suit typically should be joined into that divorce 
case instead of proceeding separately. The policy behind this is to have one court speak on all 
parent-child issues at a time, preventing inconsistent orders. In a normal scenario, if Parent A 
filed for divorce (including child custody) in Court X, Parent B would not be allowed to file a 
separate SAPCR in Court Y at the same time – the law would mandate that the child’s case be 
heard in the first-filed divorce court. 
2. So, generally, an active divorce case would mean any custody claims belong in that 
lawsuit, not in a new, independent suit elsewhere.

INTRODUCTION

1. Texas law does generally require consolidation of divorce and custody matters to
avoid conflicting parallel litigation. Under Family Code § 6.407, if a SAPCR involving the child
is already pending in one court when a divorce is filed in another court, the SAPCR must be
transferred to the divorce court so that one judge handles everything. Likewise, if the parents
are in the middle of a divorce, any new custody suit typically should be joined into that divorce
case instead of proceeding separately. The policy behind this is to have one court speak on all
parent-child issues at a time, preventing inconsistent orders. In a normal scenario, if Parent A
filed for divorce (including child custody) in Court X, Parent B would not be allowed to file a
separate SAPCR in Court Y at the same time — the law would mandate that the child’s case be

heard in the first-filed divorce court.

2. So, generally, an active divorce case would mean any custody claims belong in that

lawsuit, not in a new, independent suit elsewhere.

3. However, § 6.407 assumes the initial divorce suit is properly filed and being pursued. 
Its joinder and transfer rules are meant to coordinate valid, concurrent proceedings. It does not 
explicitly address a situation where the original divorce/SAPCR is essentially a sham or has 
stalled out. In your case, while technically the divorce case exists, it was filed in bad faith and 
has produced no valid orders or final judgment. This puts it outside the typical scenario § 6.407 
contemplates. If the original case is on track to be dismissed or is proven to be jurisdictionally 
defective, there may soon be no “pending” case to join into. Thus, the usual mandatory joinder 
rule may not pose a long-term barrier, especially if you move to dismiss the old case for lack of 
prosecution. In short, ordinarily you must litigate child issues in the divorce suit, but when 
that suit is effectively defunct or void, the rationale for mandatory joinder falls away. 
II. Dominant Jurisdiction and Exceptions for Bad-Faith First Filings 
4. Even when no final order exists, Texas follows a “first in time” rule for parallel cases: 
the court where a suit is first filed generally has dominant jurisdiction, meaning it has the 
primary right to proceed, and any later-filed suit involving the same parties and issues should be 
abated (paused) or dismissed. Applied here, because the divorce case was filed earlier, a new 
SAPCR in another court would normally face a plea in abatement from the first filer. The second 
court would typically defer to the first-filed court’s authority over the matter. But importantly, 
Texas law also recognizes exceptions to the first-filed rule in cases of inequitable conduct. If the 
person who filed the first suit did so merely to gain an upper hand (for example, to lock in a 
preferred venue or harass the other parent) without any genuine intent to prosecute the case, 
that behavior can estop (prevent) them from claiming the benefits of dominant jurisdiction. 
5. Here, this is precisely what has occurred. COOPER L. CARTER, attorney for 
Respondent, has not prosecuted the first-filed case in over eight months. Her authority remains

in question under rule 12 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and hasn’t filed the mandatory 
notice of remand after federal removal, which occurred back in December of 2024. This 
procedurally prevents the case from moving forward until this requirement is met, which has not 
only been pointed out to Ms. Carter, but has been wholly disregarded. 
6. Now, Ms. Carter is before this court seeking to consolidate the SAPCR suit filed and 
captioned above back into the original suit in which she has not been prosecuting. Such action 
would further prejudice the children, and Ms. Carter should have to explain why she has failed to 
prosecute the main case, but yet can show up here and request consolidation. If Ms. Carter were 
genuinely looking to uphold the best interests of the children in this case, she wouldn’t allow 
their well-being to hang in the balance within the originally filed case – but she has been – which 
is why this SAPCR was brought before this court.  
7. Further, The Texas Supreme Court in Curtis v. Gibbs explained that a first filer’s bad 
faith or fraud can remove the shield of the first-filed rule and allow a later suit to go forward. 
This also applies here. Ms. Carter’s client initiated the divorce action in bad faith, and waived the 
60-day waiting period for divorce claiming an active order of protection was in effect against the 
undersigned. This was elected for the sole purpose of gaining an unfair advantage in the divorce 
proceedings. Once this advantage was gained, she stopped prosecuting the suit. 
8. Generally, if Suit 1 was essentially a placeholder or manipulation (filed “merely to 
obtain priority, without a bona fide intention to prosecute the suit” and the filer’s conduct kept

in question under rule 12 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and hasn’t filed the mandatory
notice of remand after federal removal, which occurred back in December of 2024. This
procedurally prevents the case from moving forward until this requirement is met, which has not

only been pointed out to Ms. Carter, but has been wholly disregarded.

6. Now, Ms. Carter is before this court seeking to consolidate the SAPCR suit filed and
captioned above back into the original suit in which she has not been prosecuting. Such action
would further prejudice the children, and Ms. Carter should have to explain why she has failed to
prosecute the main case, but yet can show up here and request consolidation. If Ms. Carter were
genuinely looking to uphold the best interests of the children in this case, she wouldn’t allow
their well-being to hang in the balance within the originally filed case — but she has been — which

is why this SAPCR was brought before this court.

7. Further, The Texas Supreme Court in Curtis v. Gibbs explained that a first filer’s bad
faith or fraud can remove the shield of the first-filed rule and allow a later suit to go forward.
This also applies here. Ms. Carter’s client initiated the divorce action in bad faith, and waived the
60-day waiting period for divorce claiming an active order of protection was in effect against the
undersigned. This was elected for the sole purpose of gaining an unfair advantage in the divorce

proceedings. Once this advantage was gained, she stopped prosecuting the suit.

8. Generally, if Suit ] was essentially a placeholder or manipulation (filed “merely to
obtain priority, without a bona fide intention to prosecute the suit” and the filer’s conduct kept
Suit 2 from being filed sooner, a court can find that Suit 1 was an inequitable sham. In that event,
the second court may deny the plea in abatement and take the case, effectively jumping past
the first court. Jd. Here, the facts suggest the prior divorce action was in bad faith and then

abandoned — precisely the kind of scenario in which Texas courts allow an exception to the

“first-filed” rule. The Respondent in this matter had no serious intent to pursue the 
divorce/SAPCR (e.g. they filed to harass or to get temporary orders, then let the case languish), 
giving this court the discretion to refuse to abate/consolidate this SAPCR. The first court’s 
dominant jurisdiction dissolves if the first suit was a null effort. Therefore, given the 
circumstances, the opposing counsel should have to explain the reasoning behind her failure to 
prosecute before consolidation ordered under the assertion that it is “mandatory”. 
III. Filing a New SAPCR in a Different Court Under These Circumstances 
9. Given the above, nothing in Texas law absolutely bars the undersigned from filing 
a new SAPCR for his children in this court, because the original case truly produced no final 
orders and is effectively moribund. Texas Family Code § 155.001(d) explicitly provides that if no 
final order has been rendered in a SAPCR, any subsequent suit regarding the child is simply 
treated as a new original proceeding. 
9. That means the undersigned legally permitted to start fresh with a new custody suit 
because the first case never culminated in a final judgment. Additionally, the Texas Supreme 
Court has described a subsequent SAPCR in these circumstances as “a new suit in which no 
court has continuing exclusive jurisdiction”. Curtis v. Gibbs, 511 S.W.2d 263, 267 (Tex. 1974) 
(orig. proceeding) - confirming that a pending-but-unresolved prior case does not freeze the 
undersigned out of seeking relief from this court on behalf of his children. 
IV. The Old Case Faces Statutory Dismissal for Failure to Prosecute 
 
10. Interestingly, the first case has already had a motion to dismiss for want of 
prosecution filed. Unfortunately, due to Ms. Carter’s inability to prosecute the case, it remains in 
procedural limbo never properly remanded from federal court. So even if the cases were

consolidated, she would have no ability to proceed with the litigation, effectively putting this 
scenario back in the same spot, which would be prejudicial to the children. 
 
11. Under the Curtis v. Gibbs line of cases, the new court has authority to determine if the 
first filer’s conduct was inequitable. The Petitioner in this matter has not received any counter 
argument or denial regarding the claims of the Respondent’s inequitable conduct, only 
continuous attempts to subvert justice for the children named in this suit. 
 
12. The key point is that no “continuing, exclusive” jurisdiction binds the 
undersigned or the children to the old case, and an abandoned/invalid suit should not 
prevent a parent from protecting their child’s interests in a new forum. The law intends for 
one court at a time to handle a child’s case, but it does not reward a party who tried to game the 
system by filing first and then dropping the ball. The undersigned has proceeded diligently and 
transparently in the new SAPCR, and Texas law provides a path for him to do so. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
13. Because the prior divorce/SAPCR never resulted in a valid final order (and its only 
interim orders are void), that court never obtained continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the 
children. In the INTEREST OF A.F., W.J., A.J., and J.J., Children No. 02-19-00117-CV. A parent 
in this situation is generally free to initiate a new SAPCR as an original proceeding in the 
appropriate court. TEX. FAM. CODE 155.001(b)(2). While Texas law usually tries to funnel all 
custody matters into one court, it will not force you to remain tethered to a lawsuit that was filed 
in bad faith and then abandoned. The doctrines of continuing exclusive jurisdiction and 
mandatory joinder do not bar a new suit when the original case is effectively a nullity. Here, 
that is precisely the case, and until these points are rebutted by the opposing party, they prevail.

NO. 322-744263-23 
IN THE 322nd DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
 
 
TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THIS COURT: 
Charles Dustin Myers (“Respondent”), acting pro se, files this Objection to the 
attempted consolidation of the newly filed Suit Affecting Parent-Child Relationship 
(SAPCR) (Cause No. 233-765358-25) with the above-numbered case, and moves for 
declaratory relief regarding the existing orders and for dismissal of the dormant divorce 
action for want of prosecution. In support, Respondent shows the Court the following 
unopposed facts and demonstrates that consolidation would perpetuate procedural abuses, 
violate the children’s best interests, and deny due process. Respondent further provides 
legal authority under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, Texas Family Code, and 
controlling case law to support the relief requested. The detriment to the children that has 
been ongoing cannot continue to be disregarded simply because the Respondent is pro-se.

I. STATEMENT OF FACTS 
A. Ongoing Harm to the Children  
1. The two children of the parties are suffering ongoing and severe harm due to 
Petitioner’s actions. They are being subjected to psychological manipulation and 
medical neglect by Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, resulting in deteriorating mental 
health and emotional wellbeing. For instance, the children are being gaslighted by 
Petitioner into the false belief that the divorce case has already been finalized, causing 
confusion and distress. These allegations – including psychological harm, medical 
neglect, emotional alienation, and academic decline – are well-documented in exhibits 
previously provided to Petitioner’s counsel. To date, neither Petitioner nor her counsel 
has refuted or even responded to these serious charges of ongoing harm to the children. 
 
 
 
B. Children Left in Unsafe Conditions
2. Petitioner has repeatedly left the young children home alone at night without 
any adult supervision. This creates an obvious and unacceptable safety risk. Respondent 
has raised this issue, yet Petitioner and her counsel have offered no denial or explanation. 
At present, the children have been removed from Respondent’s daily care and placed with 
their elderly great-grandparents. This abrupt change in living situation occurred after 
Respondent – their father – was unlawfully locked out of the family home on March 6, 
2024. Since that date, Respondent has been prevented from accessing his home and 
caring for the children, disrupting the only stable parenting they have known.

3. Respondent’s exclusion from the home and the children’s lives was done under 
color of “current orders” that Petitioner obtained in the divorce action. Those orders were 
procured through facially inconsistent and procedurally improper pleadings, as 
detailed further below. Petitioner’s unilateral actions have caused Respondent significant 
harm: he has suffered approximately $110,500 in verifiable financial damages due to 
the unlawful lockout, loss of use of the residence, and the interruption of his parent-child 
relationship. This damage continues to accrue as the Respondent remains barred from his 
home and from normal contact with the children. Opposing counsel and Petitioner have 
been provided financial records and business earnings showing these damages, yet have 
provided no response or acknowledgement of these damages. 
D. Facially Void and Inconsistent Orders 
4. The “current orders” governing possession of the children were obtained by 
Petitioner through pleadings and procedures that are facially inconsistent and legally 
inadequate. On their face, the orders claim consent of all parties yet only bear the 
signatures of the Petitioner and her Counsel. These orders were entered despite clear 
consent being absent, which in effect has dismantled the prior status quo for the 
children under the guise of these questionable orders, even though Respondent contends 
– and will demonstrate – that these orders have no valid legal effect. Neither Petitioner 
nor her counsel has offered any substantive response or justification for the 
inconsistencies surrounding the creation of these orders, effectively conceding the issue 
by silence.

5. Since obtaining these dubious orders, Petitioner has actively alienated the 
children from Respondent and deprived them of the stable, loving care he consistently 
provided since birth. The eldest child’s academic performance has plummeted, and both 
children are emotionally estranged from both parents – a direct result of Petitioner’s 
interference with Respondent’s access and her neglect of the children’s emotional needs. 
Petitioner’s actions have upended the children’s best interests, which under Texas law 
should be the paramount consideration in any proceeding involving minors. Respondent 
has fought tirelessly for over a year to restore stability and to protect the children, but 
those efforts have been stymied by procedural delays and Petitioner’s lack of cooperation. 
F. Procedural History and Counsel’s Inactivity 
6. The underlying divorce case has languished without prosecution for over a 
year. Petitioner’s attorney of record, Cooper L. Carter, effectively abandoned the case 
after April 24, 2024. On that date, Ms. Carter filed a Motion for Pre-Trial Conference – 
the last action she took in this matter until very recently. In the eleven months following 
that filing, Ms. Carter filed no pleadings, made no court appearances, and utterly failed to 
advance the case toward trial or resolution. During this period of dormancy, Respondent 
(pro se) repeatedly sought relief to address the children’s situation, yet Ms. Carter never 
filed a single objection, response, or argument to counter Respondent’s motions or 
requests for relief. Serious and well-documented allegations – including child 
endangerment and de facto custody interference – went completely unanswered by 
Petitioner and her counsel for over a year.

F. Procedural History and Counsel’s Inactivity

6. The underlying divorce case has languished without prosecution for over a
year. Petitioner’s attorney of record, Cooper L. Carter, effectively abandoned the case
after April 24, 2024. On that date, Ms. Carter filed a Motion for Pre-Trial Conference —
the /ast action she took in this matter until very recently. In the eleven months following
that filing, Ms. Carter filed no pleadings, made no court appearances, and utterly failed to
advance the case toward trial or resolution. During this period of dormancy, Respondent
(pro se) repeatedly sought relief to address the children’s situation, yet Ms. Carter never
filed a single objection, response, or argument to counter Respondent’s motions or
requests for relief. Serious and well-documented allegations — including child
endangerment and de facto custody interference — went completely unanswered by

Petitioner and her counsel for over a year.

G. Failure to Engage in Discovery — Deemed Admissions

7. During the divorce litigation, Respondent properly served Petitioner with 
written discovery, including Requests for Admissions under Texas Rule of Civil 
Procedure 198. Petitioner’s counsel failed to respond or object to these Requests for 
Admissions within the time required by law, resulting in those matters being deemed 
admitted by operation of law. Thus, critical facts are conclusively established against 
Petitioner – for example, facts regarding the children’s neglect and the lack of a final 
divorce decree may have been admitted, converting marital assets, and fabricating family 
violence – further prejudicing Petitioner’s position. Despite the grave effect of these 
deemed admissions (which have been pointed out to Ms. Carter), she made no effort to 
withdraw or amend them and filed no responses whatsoever, effectively conceding their 
truth. 
H. Rule 11 and Rule 237a Violations 
8. Throughout the litigation, there has been no valid Rule 11 agreement filed that 
would excuse Petitioner’s obligations or justify the prolonged inaction. Any suggestion of 
an agreed status quo or private arrangement is refuted by the absence of a signed writing 
or on-record agreement (as required by Tex. R. Civ. P. 11). Moreover, Respondent 
removed the case to federal court to seek protection of his rights. The case was later 
remanded to this Court, but Petitioner’s counsel failed to comply with Tex. R. Civ. P. 
237a upon remand. Specifically, counsel did not file the required certified copy of the 
federal remand order with the clerk and did not provide Respondent with the mandatory 
written notice of the remand. Ms. Carter’s neglect of this basic procedural duty prevents 
the case from moving forward to a final trial setting and further exemplifies her lack of 
diligence.

I. Challenge to Counsel’s Authority (Rule 12) 
9. Given Ms. Carter’s persistent non-communication and inaction, and that all 
pleadings filed in this matter have been on her behalf by a non-party,  Respondent filed a 
motion under Tex. R. Civ. P. 12 challenging whether Ms. Carter truly has authority to 
represent Petitioner and clear up the ambiguity surrounding her representation. Ms. 
Carter has not meaningfully corresponded with Respondent at all during the litigation – 
she is unreachable by phone or email, is not properly registered for e-filing 
notifications on the re:SearchTX platform, and even lacks a current working phone 
number or email on file with the State Bar of Texas. Such a complete breakdown in 
participation raises the question of whether Petitioner has been informed or is even aware 
of the current status of the case given the children are being told the divorce is finalized. 
Respondent’s Rule 12 motion puts Ms. Carter to the burden of proving her authority to 
act; tellingly, in the 14 months of litigation Ms. Carter has yet to produce any client 
authority or engagement, and she ignored the Rule 12 challenge just as she ignored 
every other filing. Under these circumstances, Respondent asserts Ms. Carter may no 
longer be authorized to represent Petitioner’s interests – if she ever was – and that her 
filings should be stricken if she cannot promptly show authority as required by law. 
Respondent is under no obligation to set any matter for hearing because doing so would 
waive her obligations to fulfill rule 237a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. 
J. Sudden Appearance to Block Emergency Relief 
10. After nearly a full year of silence and inactivity, Ms. Carter abruptly 
resurfaced only when Respondent sought emergency relief for the children in a new 
proceeding. In March of 2025, Respondent, desperate to address the children’s worsening

situation, filed a new SAPCR in the 233rd District Court (Cause No. 233-765358-25) 
and obtained a hearing setting for an emergency Temporary Restraining Order to protect 
the children. The very first involvement by Ms. Carter since April 2024 was to appear at 
the eleventh hour in the 233rd District Court and object to the TRO hearing 
through a phone call without ever responding to the TRO or arguing against it. 
Simultaneously, she filed a Motion to Consolidate the new SAPCR case back into the old 
322nd District Court divorce case – a case that has been dormant and effectively stalled 
under void orders. In doing so, Ms. Carter offered no substantive rebuttal to any of 
Respondent’s factual allegations (1–9 above). She provided no explanation for her 
prolonged absence or her client’s failures and inconsistencies, and no justification as to 
how consolidation would serve the children’s best interests. Her sole aim appears to 
be procedural: to drag the new child-focused case into the moribund divorce proceeding, 
effectively keeping the children in legal limbo and delaying any real relief. 
K. No Opposition on the Merits 
11. Over the 14 months of litigation, Petitioner and Ms. Carter have never filed 
a single pleading addressing the merits of Respondent’s claims or the children’s needs. 
They have not objected to evidence, not answered discovery (beyond the deemed 
admissions), not responded to motions, and not presented any competing evidence or 
legal argument. Their pattern is one of total silence on substance, interrupted only by a 
procedural maneuver to avoid a hearing. This stands in stark contrast to Respondent’s 
detailed filings and evidence chronicling the children’s plight. Accordingly, the factual 
allegations enumerated above stand unopposed and uncontroverted in the record of 
both the 322nd and 233rd District Court matters. The Court “cannot continue to ignore”

these undisputed facts, as they demand urgent action for the sake of the children’s 
welfare. 
L. Urgency of Relief 
12. As repeatedly stated - every day that passes without corrective action is a day 
in which the children remain in an unstable, harmful environment. Respondent has 
relentlessly pursued lawful avenues to restore the prior stable status quo for the children, 
only to be met with procedural stonewalling. It would be highly prejudicial to reward 
Petitioner and her counsel’s negligence and gamesmanship by allowing further delay 
through consolidation. Indeed, to do so would blatantly disregard Respondent’s rights 
and, more importantly, the children’s best interests. The time has come for the Court to 
recognize that Petitioner’s counsel – despite holding a law license – has forfeited any 
entitlement to deference through her conduct. Respondent’s self-represented status should 
no longer serve as an excuse to deny or defer relief that the children so desperately need. 
These facts provide the factual foundation for Respondent’s objections and requests for 
relief. With these unchallenged facts in mind, Respondent now turns to the legal reasons 
why consolidation must be denied, the prior orders declared void, and the dormant case 
dismissed, in order to protect due process and the best interests of the children. 
II. VOIDNESS OF THE CURRENT ORDERS 
13. The “Current Orders” Were Improperly Obtained and Are Void for Lack of 
Consent and Inconsistent Pleadings. The orders under which Petitioner has been 
operating – specifically those used to exclude Respondent from the home and curtail his 
possession of the children – are fundamentally flawed and void. It appears these orders

were presented to the Court as agreed or uncontested, yet the record reflects that 
Respondent never gave knowing consent to any such final settlement. Under Texas law, 
any judgment based upon a purported agreement of the parties requires “unequivocal 
consent at the time of rendition”, and if a party withdraws consent before the judgment is 
rendered, the judgment is void. See Burnaman v. Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 (Tex. 
1951) (holding that when a trial court has knowledge that one party does not consent to a 
judgment, it is error to render a judgment purportedly by agreement; such a judgment is a 
nullity). Likewise, Padilla v. LaFrance, 907 S.W.2d 454 (Tex. 1995) confirms that a trial 
court cannot render an agreed judgment after a party has withdrawn consent to a 
settlement. In short, if one party withheld or withdrew consent, the only method to 
resolve the dispute is a trial on the merits, not entry of an “agreed” order. 
14. Here, the facial inconsistencies in Petitioner’s pleadings and the circumstances 
of how the orders were procured leave no room for logic that he would agree to his 
children’s and his own detriment. Respondent has actively opposed the terms that locked 
him out of his home and separated him from the children. Petitioner misrepresented to the 
Court that an agreement existed alongside her counsel and it was rendered without 
consent. Such an order is void ab initio under the Burnaman and Padilla line of cases. 
Any decree or order dividing rights or restricting Respondent that was entered without a 
proper hearing or true agreement violates Respondent’s due process rights and cannot 
stand. Respondent seeks a declaratory judgment from this Court that any orders 
affecting conservatorship, possession, or property division that were not rendered 
after a valid hearing or with proper consent are void and of no legal effect. This 
declaration is necessary to clarify the parties’ legal position and to remove the cloud of

these improper orders from the case, and immediately restore his right to his residence 
pending a hearing on the merits to satisfy the best interests of the children. 
B. Lack of Judicial Adoption (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.013) 
15. Even if Petitioner’s claim for consent somehow survives despite the absence 
of Respondent’s signature – they remain facially void because they were issued by an 
Associate Judge and never properly adopted or signed by the referring District Court. 
Under Texas Family Code § 201.013(b), if no timely request for a de novo hearing is 
filed after an associate judge’s proposed order, that proposed order “becomes the order 
of the referring court only on the referring court’s signing” the order. In this case, 
there is no record that the 322nd District Court Judge ever signed or entered a final order 
adopting the Associate Judge’s recommendations regarding custody or property. If the 
District Judge did not sign an order, then no final order exists – the associate judge’s 
ruling, while perhaps enforceable interim, never achieved the status of a final judgment 
of the court and has no legal effect. 
16. This may explain why the Texas OAG attempted to intervene in June of 2024 
and has since disappeared from pursuing relief. 
17. Therefore, they should be declared void or vacated due to the lack of proper 
adoption, lack of findings, and for the continuous and irreparable harm they continue to 
inflict on the children and Respondent.

itself). Texas Family Code § 155.001(a) provides that a court acquires continuing, 
exclusive jurisdiction (CEJ) over child matters “on the rendition of a final order” in a 
suit affecting the parent-child relationship. Conversely, § 155.001(d) states: “Unless a 
final order has been rendered by a court of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction, a 
subsequent suit shall be commenced as an original proceeding.” 
19. In this case, the 322nd District Court never rendered a final order resolving 
the SAPCR or divorce – the orders in place are interlocutory and void. Therefore, the 
322nd never acquired continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the children, and the new 
SAPCR Respondent filed in 2025 was properly “commenced as an original 
proceeding” under § 155.001(d). This point cannot be overstated: there is currently no 
valid final judgment in the divorce case. The divorce remains unadjudicated and the 
parent-child issues remain unresolved by any final decree. Petitioner’s counsel’s 
insistence that the new SAPCR must be consolidated into the divorce case (as if that 
court had dominant jurisdiction) misstates the law. Because no final order exists, the 
233rd District Court is not barred from proceeding with the SAPCR. In fact, the Family 
Code explicitly allows a new original suit in these circumstances.  
20. Respondent had every right to file a new petition to protect his children when 
it became clear the old case was mired in procedural limbo. Accordingly, this Court 
should declare that the prior orders have no legal effect and confirm that the 322nd 
District Court lacks continuing jurisdiction due to the absence of any final order. This 
declaratory relief will clarify that the new SAPCR case may proceed on its own merits, 
unencumbered by the baggage of the defunct divorce proceeding that remain a one-sided 
case with no ability to reach final trial, as explained above.

III. OBJECTION TO CONSOLIDATION 
21. Respondent unequivocally objects to the consolidation of the new child 
custody case (SAPCR) with the dormant divorce case and asks this Court to deny any 
such motion to consolidate. Consolidation at this juncture would be illogical, prejudicial, 
and contrary to Texas law and equity. The following legal grounds support sustaining 
Respondent’s objection: 
A. The First-Filed Divorce Case Does Not Have “Dominant Jurisdiction”  
22. Generally, when two suits involving the same subject matter are pending in 
different courts of equal jurisdiction, the court in which the suit was first filed has 
dominant jurisdiction and the latter is typically abated. See Wyatt v. Shaw Plumbing Co., 
760 S.W.2d 245, 247 (Tex. 1988) (citing Cleveland v. Ward, 116 Tex. 1, 285 S.W. 1063 
(1926)). However, Texas law recognizes critical exceptions to the “first-filed” rule. The 
Texas Supreme Court in Wyatt reiterated three well-established exceptions: “(1) conduct 
by a party that estops him from asserting prior active jurisdiction; (2) lack of persons to 
be joined if feasible; and (3) lack of intent to prosecute the first lawsuit.” (quoting V.D. 
Anderson Co. v. Young, 101 S.W.2d 798 (Tex. 1937); Curtis v. Gibbs, 511 S.W.2d 263 
(Tex. 1974)). If any of these exceptions apply, the court with the first filing does not have 
dominant jurisdiction, and the second court may proceed. Wyatt, 760 S.W.2d at 248. 
23. Here, at least two of the exceptions squarely apply, both flowing from 
Petitioner’s and Ms. Carter’s conduct in the divorce case.

Ill. OBJECTION TO CONSOLIDATION

21. Respondent unequivocally objects to the consolidation of the new child
custody case (SAPCR) with the dormant divorce case and asks this Court to deny any
such motion to consolidate. Consolidation at this juncture would be illogical, prejudicial,
and contrary to Texas law and equity. The following legal grounds support sustaining

Respondent’s objection:

A. The First-Filed Divorce Case Does Not Have “Dominant Jurisdiction’’

22. Generally, when two suits involving the same subject matter are pending in
different courts of equal jurisdiction, the court in which the suit was first filed has
dominant jurisdiction and the latter is typically abated. See Wyatt v. Shaw Plumbing Co.,
760 S.W.2d 245, 247 (Tex. 1988) (citing Cleveland v. Ward, 116 Tex. 1, 285 S.W. 1063
(1926)). However, Texas law recognizes critical exceptions to the “first-filed” rule. The
Texas Supreme Court in Wyatt reiterated three well-established exceptions: “(1) conduct
by a party that estops him from asserting prior active jurisdiction; (2) lack of persons to
be joined if feasible; and (3) lack of intent to prosecute the first lawsuit.” (quoting V.D.
Anderson Co. v. Young, 101 S.W.2d 798 (Tex. 1937); Curtis v. Gibbs, 511 S.W.2d 263
(Tex. 1974)). If any of these exceptions apply, the court with the first filing does not have

dominant jurisdiction, and the second court may proceed. Wyatt, 760 S.W.2d at 248.

23. Here, at least two of the exceptions squarely apply, both flowing from

Petitioner’s and Ms. Carter’s conduct in the divorce case.

B. Estoppel by Conduct

24. Petitioner’s actions (through her counsel) should estop her from claiming the 
benefit of the first-filed divorce case. She allowed that case to become completely 
dormant and failed to notify the Court or Respondent of the case’s status after the federal 
remand. By failing to comply with Rule 237a’s notice requirements and effectively 
concealing the revival of the state case from proceeding on the merits, consolidation is 
inappropriate without some form of input from the opposing side. 
25. Petitioner’s counsel also did nothing to set hearings or trial, effectively 
representing that she had abandoned the case. Petitioner cannot now, at the last minute, 
resurrect that case to block a new one – equity and fair play will not permit a party to 
sleep on her rights and then use the prior filing as a weapon. Petitioner’s conduct is 
precisely the kind that warrants estoppel from asserting dominant jurisdiction. 
C. Lack of Intent to Prosecute the First Suit 
 
26. Perhaps the most glaring exception is the third exception. Petitioner 
demonstrated a “lack of intent to prosecute the first lawsuit.” Young, 128 Tex. at 636-37, 
101 S.W.2d at 800-01; see also Curtis, 511 S.W.2d at 267. For nearly a year, she took no 
action to advance the divorce. No discovery, no responses, no settings – nothing. Such 
extended inaction is tantamount to an intention not to pursue the case at all. Texas courts 
have found that when a first-filing party shows no real intent to prosecute their case, a 
second case can proceed notwithstanding the first-filed rule. See, e.g., Wyatt, 760 S.W.2d 
at 248 (recognizing lack of intent to prosecute as an exception). 
 
27. In the present situation, Petitioner only “revived” the divorce case as a 
strategic ploy to derail Respondent’s emergency action in the second case. This

opportunistic and belated move underscores that Petitioner’s interest lies not in diligently 
prosecuting her first suit, but in obstructing Respondent’s efforts elsewhere. The first case 
was effectively dead on the docket; there was no genuine intent to prosecute it until 
Respondent’s new filing prompted a defensive response. This swift action was done 
solely to avoid accountability from the court that the Respondent has diligently exposed 
without argument. 
 
28. Because of these exceptions, the 322nd District Court cannot be said to have 
dominant jurisdiction. Petitioner forfeited any priority through her own lack of diligence. 
Therefore, there is no legal basis to consolidate the new case into the old one; the usual 
policy of avoiding conflicting jurisdictions must yield to the reality that the first case was 
moribund and is rife with procedural defects. Indeed, the 233rd District Court (new 
SAPCR) is the appropriate forum to hear the current disputes because that case was 
initiated specifically to address the children’s urgent needs, free from the entanglements 
of the stalled divorce. 
 
29. The only counter argument anticipated by the opposition is that the fingers 
will point towards the undersigned, which is nothing more than an excuse for failure to 
participate in Respondent’s quest seeking relief at every available opportunity to advocate 
for his children. Surely a licensed attorney could put forth a legal argument against an 
unruly pro-se litigant – yet here – there exists only silence. 
D. Consolidation Would Reward Procedural Abuse 
30. Even apart from dominant jurisdiction principles, this Court has discretion to 
deny consolidation when it would prejudice a party or not further the interests of justice.

Tex. R. Civ. P. 174(a) permits consolidation of actions involving common questions of 
law or fact, but only “to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.” Here, consolidation would do 
the opposite – it would inflict further delay and costs and gravely prejudice the children’s 
welfare. The new SAPCR was filed to obtain immediate relief (such as restraining orders 
or modified custody) to protect the children. That relief has already been delayed by 
Petitioner’s maneuver; consolidating into the divorce would likely cause weeks or 
months of additional delay as the tangle of the divorce procedure is sorted out (especially 
if the Court must resolve questions about void orders, jurisdiction, or counsel’s status in 
that case). 
31. The best interests of the children is the “primary consideration” in any 
proceeding affecting them. Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002. It is patently not in the children’s 
best interest to postpone substantive relief on issues of their safety and wellbeing so that 
an old divorce action can be resurrected. The children should not be made to suffer 
further harm just because Petitioner’s counsel neglected her duties for a year. 
Consolidation would effectively reward Petitioner for her neglect – she would succeed 
in further delaying a reckoning on her harmful conduct, all while the children remain in a 
detrimental situation. Such an outcome would be unjust.  
IV. PETITIONER’S COUNSEL’S MISCONDUCT 
 
32. The Court should also take notice of the conduct of Petitioner’s counsel, 
Cooper L. Carter, which has significantly contributed to the procedural morass and denial 
of due process in this matter. Ms. Carter’s behavior not only prejudices Respondent but 
also violates basic professional obligations. Respondent highlights the following and 
requests appropriate relief:

A. Failure to Respond and Show Authority (Tex. R. Civ. P. 12) 
33. As described, Respondent has challenged Ms. Carter’s authority to act on 
Petitioner’s behalf by motion under Rule 12 in September of 2024. To date, Ms. Carter 
has not responded to this challenge. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12 requires an 
attorney, upon such a motion, to prove her authority to act for the client or else be barred 
from further participation. When an attorney fails to appear or fails to carry this burden, 
the court “shall” strike the attorney’s pleadings and bar her from representing the client in 
that case. In TransAmerica Corp. v. Braes Woods Condo Ass’n, for example, a verified 
motion to show authority was granted when a question arose about a corporation’s 
capacity; the trial court dismissed the attorney and struck the pleadings filed without 
proper authority.  
34. Here, Ms. Carter’s complete absence and unavailability strongly suggest she 
may not have her client’s authorization or active direction. It is even conceivable that 
Petitioner herself has not been kept apprised by Ms. Carter, given the lack of 
communication. Respondent requests that the Court require Ms. Carter to promptly 
prove her authority. If she fails, the Court should strike any consolidation motion or 
other pleadings she filed and preclude her from further advocacy in this matter. The 
practical effect would render Petitioner unrepresented – a status Petitioner is effectively 
in already, due to Ms. Carter’s dereliction. While Respondent takes no pleasure in 
Petitioner potentially losing counsel, the integrity of the proceedings demands that only 
duly authorized representatives be allowed to act.

35. Ms. Carter’s neglect of discovery – particularly her failure to answer Requests 
for Admissions – has materially harmed the truth-finding process. By operation of Rule 
198, Petitioner is deemed to have admitted every fact in the Request for Admissions that 
was unanswered. These deemed admissions are dispositive of key issues. Ms. Carter’s 
failure to perform the most basic task of responding to discovery is a violation of her 
duties under Tex. R. Civ. P. 193.2 and 193.5 (to timely amend or respond) and has 
prejudiced her own client’s case. In fact, her inaction practically concedes Respondent’s 
claims and allegations. The Court should treat the deemed admissions as conclusively 
established in considering this Objection and the underlying merits – meaning that, for 
purposes of this objection, Petitioner has admitted the truth of the allegations in Section I, 
and can be admitted as summary judgement evidence, which remains un-opposed and sits 
as the oldest filed motion on this court’s docket. (Filed and Served February 22, 2024). 
Furthermore, the Court should impose sanctions under Tex. R. Civ. P. 215 for the 
discovery abuse, although Respondent’s primary goal is not monetary sanctions but to 
ensure the facts are recognized as admitted due to Ms. Carter’s failure. 
C. Abuse of Process 
36. Ms. Carter’s sudden filing of a Motion to Consolidate after a year of 
dormancy appears to be a textbook example of using legal process for delay and to 
burden an opponent, rather than for a legitimate purpose. Rule 13 of the Texas Rules of 
Civil Procedure forbids filings that are groundless and brought in bad faith or to harass. 
Likewise, Rule 3.02 of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct states that a 
lawyer “shall not take a position that unreasonably increases the costs or other burdens of 
the case or that unreasonably delays resolution of the matter.” By her own inaction, Ms.

Carter allowed an emergency to develop; by reappearing only to procedurally thwart 
Respondent’s TRO in the 233rd, she acted to unreasonably delay the adjudication of the 
emergency. 
37. There was no substantive justification given for consolidation – no claim that 
resources would be saved or justice served – only a tactic to avoid an immediate hearing. 
This conduct comes perilously close to violating Rule 13’s prohibitions on bad-faith 
pleadings and warrants the Court’s scrutiny. Respondent respectfully submits that the 
Court should consider sanctioning Petitioner’s counsel for this behavior, which has had 
the effect of prolonging the children’s exposure to harm and multiplying litigation for no 
good reason. Sanctions could include an award of fees and expenses to Respondent 
(though pro se, Respondent has expended considerable time and resources), or fines 
payable to the Court, or any order deemed just to deter such tactics. At the very least, the 
lack of any substantive merit in the consolidation request should prompt the Court to 
deny it summarily.

Exhibit 1, the only attached exhibit in this document, as all claims and exhibits supporting 
these allegations have been in the possession of the opposing party for several months 
without any objection, communication, or argument against them. The exhibit resembles 
a cookie-cutter motion that provides no substance into the core issues of the case.

substantive answer or response to the merits of Respondent’s claims in over a year, the

ii. 
Enter a declaratory judgment that any orders entered in this divorce action 
that purported to resolve conservatorship, possession, or property issues 
are void and/or of no legal effect due to lack of proper consent, notice, or 
final adoption by the Court. Specifically, declare that no final order was 
rendered in this cause, that the March 14, 2024 “agreed orders” which 
claim consent despite missing signatures do not constitute a final 
adjudication, and that they cannot be enforced as a final judgment. 
iii. 
Dismiss the divorce action (Cause No. 322-744263-23) in its entirety for 
want of prosecution pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 165a and the Court’s 
inherent authority.  
iv. 
Although a serious step, the Respondent prays that the Court consider 
referring Ms. Carter’s conduct to the appropriate disciplinary 
committee of the State Bar of Texas for investigation. The Court’s 
findings of fact or a simple referral letter could highlight the issues: 
prolonged neglect, failure to follow court rules (Rule 237a, etc.), failure to 
maintain current contact information, and usage of a dormant case to 
obstruct justice. Such a referral may be warranted to protect the integrity 
of the legal process, especially in sensitive family law matters, or in the 
alternative, require a response to this objection. 
v. 
Grant such other and further relief as the Court finds just and proper, 
whether at law or in equity. Respondent also asks that the Court take 
judicial notice of the contents of the court’s file in this cause and (if

Enter a declaratory judgment that any orders entered in this divorce action
that purported to resolve conservatorship, possession, or property issues
are void and/or of no legal effect due to lack of proper consent, notice, or
final adoption by the Court. Specifically, declare that no final order was
rendered in this cause, that the March 14, 2024 “‘agreed orders” which
claim consent despite missing signatures do not constitute a final
adjudication, and that they cannot be enforced as a final judgment.
Dismiss the divorce action (Cause No. 322-744263-23) in its entirety for
want of prosecution pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 165a and the Court’s
inherent authority.

Although a serious step, the Respondent prays that the Court consider
referring Ms. Carter’s conduct to the appropriate disciplinary
committee of the State Bar of Texas for investigation. The Court’s
findings of fact or a simple referral letter could highlight the issues:
prolonged neglect, failure to follow court rules (Rule 237a, etc.), failure to
maintain current contact information, and usage of a dormant case to
obstruct justice. Such a referral may be warranted to protect the integrity
of the legal process, especially in sensitive family law matters, or in the
alternative, require a response to this objection.

Grant such other and further relief as the Court finds just and proper,
whether at law or in equity. Respondent also asks that the Court take

judicial notice of the contents of the court’s file in this cause and (if

IN THE 322nd DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
TO THE HONORABLE COURT: 
Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, respectfully submits this statement to the 
Court, acknowledging first the gravity and complexity inherent in adjudicating matters of Family 
Law. The Respondent's numerous pleadings, motions, notices, objections, and carefully prepared 
exhibits submitted to this Court were borne not out of defiance, but rather from profound respect 
for this judicial process and a dedicated attempt to bridge the pro-se divide thrust upon him. 
Every zealous effort undertaken by the Respondent has been guided by a simple, 
undeniable reality: the well-being and best interests of two minor children. The Respondent 
urges the Court to momentarily step into the shoes of these children, who, at the end of each 
school day, exit their classrooms only to find neither parent awaiting their arrival to guide them 
safely home. Once home, they find no father present to assist them with homework, to engage 
them in play, or simply to inquire about their day and ensure their academic and emotional needs 
are met. 
Instead, these children must rely on their great-grandparents or their aunt for daily care—
arrangements that, while filled with love, impose upon their caregivers’ responsibilities that 
disrupt the natural grandparental dynamic and strain family resources and roles unnecessarily. 
This very scenario was expressly outlined in the Respondent's initial pleading to the Court, 
highlighting a profound shift away from the stable, nurturing environment the children 
previously enjoyed. EXHIBIT 1

upon the human dimension of every case. The emotional appeal here is not frivolous, but rather a

TO THE HONORABLE COURT:

Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, respectfully submits this statement to the
Court, acknowledging first the gravity and complexity inherent in adjudicating matters of Family
Law. The Respondent's numerous pleadings, motions, notices, objections, and carefully prepared
exhibits submitted to this Court were borne not out of defiance, but rather from profound respect

Every zealous effort undertaken by the Respondent has been guided by a simple,

genuine representation of the stark contrast between the children's former stable environment and 
the instability they currently endure. Respondent's advocacy, although passionate, has been 
meticulously crafted to illustrate clearly that alternatives exist which restore this stability without 
risk of harm or endangerment. The driving force behind the current situation is not a legitimate 
threat of harm but rather fear of accountability by the Petitioner. 
The Respondent's zealousness, potentially misinterpreted as contemptuous, is instead a 
testament to his unwavering commitment to the well-being of his children. Restoring their previous 
status quo is essential for their educational, emotional, and developmental stability. If necessary, 
the Respondent stands ready to demonstrate his accountability through daily status reports or any 
other means this Court deems appropriate, confident that the Court will observe a swift and 
meaningful recovery in both the children's and Respondent’s lives, socially, emotionally, and 
financially. 
To the Petitioner, this resolution poses no disproportionate detriment. The Respondent 
harbors no animosity toward her, has never inflicted harm upon her or their children, and has 
consistently prioritized their collective welfare. 
Ultimately, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, the litigator, arose from the necessity faced by 
CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, the father and individual unjustly characterized from the outset as 
a criminal, an abuser, and a threat. Fully aware of the uphill battle inherent in self-representation, 
he chose this path not merely for himself, but expressly for the sake of his children and the 
preservation of their right to familial stability and emotional well-being, which is at risk each day. 
In closing, Respondent respectfully recalls his initial pleading to this Court, wherein he 
proposed a comprehensive parenting plan designed specifically to preempt precisely the instability 
and emotional distress that has now come to pass. Had this proactive and well-reasoned parenting 
plan been enacted from the outset, the turmoil now confronting this Court and this family could 
have been avoided, but it remains unopposed. Respondent renews his plea for the Court to revisit 
and adopt this original proposal, thereby safeguarding the well-being of the children, restoring 
familial harmony, and reaffirming the fundamental objectives and compassionate foundations of 
Family Law.

months later. 
5. COOPER L. CARTER’s authority to represent MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS has been in

to final trial, thereby resulting in an inevitable dismissal for want of prosecution. Exhibit 2 
12. COOPER L. CARTER’s EFM is registered to her prior employer’s email address, 
which has been pointed out several times by Petitioner. Exhibit 3 
13. The 322nd District Court of Tarrant County does not have continuous exclusive

25. The Associate Judge disagreed and refused to hear the emergency TRO. 
26. At the close of business on March 28, 2025, nothing was ever filed with the 322nd 
District Court by COOPER L. CARTER. 
27. Petitioner and the children in this suit were denied due process outright despite being 
correct in his legal position. 
28. Petitioner’s detriment to his position is the fact that he is self-represented. 
29. Respondent’s detriment to her position is the lack of prosecution or defense. 
II. ARGUMENT 
30. When it comes to remand, the obligation falls on the plaintiff to file with the state 
court a certified copy of the order of remand. TEX. R. CIV. P. 237a; see also Kashan v. McLane 
Co., NO. 03-11-00125-CV, 7 (Tex. App. Jun. 7, 2012) (holding that rule 237a’s notice 
requirements cannot be satisfied by the district court, but must come from the plaintiff.)  
 
31. This prevents any trial on the merits, and prevents any relief to the Petitioner and his 
children.  
 
32. All other facts supported by evidence have already been provided to COOPER L. 
CARTER yet continues to not engage and instead call in favors from the bench.  
 
III. CONCLUSION 
Petitioner traveled to this court with a prepared emergency supported by exhibits only to 
be turned away at the eleventh hour due to his self-represented status and in the face of no real 
opposition. The children were denied due process outright, and now have been left without a 
remedy. The proper course of action should have been to hear the TRO and put in place 
protections for the minor children pending any promises of consolidation.

The above statement of facts, unless promptly rebutted by COOPER L. CARTER, warrant 
immediate relief as duly requested in the emergency TRO through a declaratory judgement, and this court 
should proceed with the hearing date originally set for April 10th, 2025, and the emergency TRO should be 
GRANTED without further delay. 
COOPER L. CARTER disrupted much needed relief for the minor children in this case with false 
promises delivered to the tribunal that directly undermined the Petitioner’s due process rights. COOPER L. 
CARTER is fully aware that she cannot file anything in 322nd District Court because in doing so she would 
be acting ultra vires.   
Petitioner reasserts his position that COOPER L. CARTER is acting without authority, has no 
ability to comply with 237a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and cannot explain how she is able to 
abandon a case for nearly a full calendar year, yet can suddenly show up to defend her alleged client before 
this court for the sole purpose to prevent Petitioner’s emergency TRO from being heard, which was 
permitted despite being told he could present the motion. In what sense is this appropriate when children 
are involved? Does the attorney’s license give her a free pass to thwart the rules and litigate in bad faith? 
It may be a needle in the haystack, but this case defies the initial presumption that pro-se litigants 
are not as equipped or as capable as licensed attorneys, and it is no fault of COOPER L. CARTER. The 
Petitioner reminds the court that the true culprit responsible for this circumstance remains the puppet master 
hiding in the background – the Respondent – and yet Petitioner wishes no harm to her because this litigation 
is about the children. The children need their mother, but they also need their father.  
Perhaps the zealous passion has been misunderstood for contempt by the tribunal, but Petitioner’s 
motive runs parallel to that set forth in the Texas Family Code. However, despite the procedural quagmire, 
the anomalies, the pro-se status, the solution remains simple:  
Grant the relief. Nobody has argued against it, Texas law demands it, and the best interests of the 
Children depend on it. There remains no logical or legal basis to give COOPER L. CARTER any further 
deference in the face of Petitioner’s self-represented status. Petitioner welcomes any response from

COOPER L. CARTER to the contrary. If such response were to be filed, it would be the first in over fourteen 
months of litigation. 
If approached from a logical standpoint, the situation can be interpreted as such: 
i. 
COOPER L. CARTER is shackled by Rule 12 and Rule 237a of the 
Texas Rules of Civil Procedure from reaching final trial. 
ii. 
The 322nd District Court is shackled from proceeding due to Cooper 
L. Carter’s failure to prosecute. 
iii. 
The Petitioner is shackled from his home, his children’s daily lives, 
and his place of business under facially void orders that claim 
consent. 
iv. 
Most critically, the children are shackled in a situation that is not in 
their best interests and continue to suffer irreparable harm without 
any opportunity for relief and without any lawful basis. 
Indeed, that leaves just one party un-chained from this situation:  
the Respondent. Petitioner rests his case. 
IV. PRAYER 
WHEREFORE promises considered, the Petitioner, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, 
requests the following expedited relief: 
1. Take judicial knowledge that COOPER L. CARTER disrupted an emergency in 
bad faith and failed to fulfill her promise. 
2. Grant the emergency TRO without delay and keep the original hearing date set 
for April 10th as agreed by the parties on March 28th, 2025.  
3. Give no further deference to attorney COOPER L. CARTER, who has not 
prosecuted nor defended her position, and require a written response.

II. LEGAL VIOLATIONS BY FAILURE TO RULE ON MOTIONS 
1. Failure to Rule on Unopposed Motions Violates Texas Law 
A. Texas courts have a duty to rule on properly filed motions within a reasonable 
time (In re Blakeney, 254 S.W.3d 659 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2008)). 
B. Courts cannot ignore motions indefinitely, especially when they remain 
unopposed (In re Bonds, 57 S.W.3d 456 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2001)). 
2. Due Process Violations (14th Amendment, U.S. Constitution; Article I, § 19, Texas 
Constitution) 
A. The Court’s refusal to issue rulings or set hearings deprives Respondent of due 
process rights. 
B. The failure to act on Rule 12 Motion to Show Authority means opposing 
counsel may be practicing unlawfully, rendering all their filings void.

A. The Court’s inaction on emergency motions for custody and residence is a 
direct failure of its duty to prioritize the best interest of children (Tex. Fam. 
Code § 153.002). 
B. The Court has no discretion to ignore properly filed summary judgment 
motions, especially when unopposed (Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c)). There is no 
genuine issue of material fact, and the Respondent is entitled to relief as a matter 
of law. 
III. CONTINUED SILENCE FROM OPPOSING PARTY DESPITE GLARING MISUSE 
OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM 
1. The opposing party in this case has refused to prosecute for over four months. 
2. The Petitioner in this case has unquestionably deceived this court into relying on 
false claims of indigency and false claims for protection. 
3. The Respondent has filed over 4,700 pages of documents that have been ignored 
outright by the court, the opposing party, and court staff. 
4. The Petitioner continues to neglect the children medically, continues to escape 
accountability for her egregious actions, and has offered no rebuttal or defense 
against any of the claims made against her. 
5. The Respondent continues to suffer monetary damages each day this situation 
persists without resolution. 
6. The court has been given ample information to justify an immediate ruling as 
required by law, yet the Respondent continues to be stonewalled.

7. The current temporary orders state all parties agree to the terms of the order, 
reference a hearing not found on the docket sheet, yet continue to remain in effect 
despite several pleas for correction being submitted and reviewed by court staff. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
 
Respondent reasserts that Texas Law prevents such scenarios such as what is occurring in 
this case from happening, yet it continues unaddressed. Respondent only asks of this court, the 
reviewing staff, and any reviewing judicial officer that Texas laws be followed, and that this 
situation be immediately corrected. The systemic abuse faced by the Respondent has damaged 
the children’s well-being and permitted the Petitioner to continue to get away with her immoral 
actions that have placed fraud upon this court without consequence. 
 
Respondent urges this court to make swift, corrective decisions that are warranted by 
setting immediately ruling upon the pending motions before it and granting the long overdue 
relief that is both necessary and justified.

9. Most disturbing is that this settlement agreement permitted the Petitioner
to remove her children from their own home for an entire month – a clear 
disregard for their well being – and the court signed off on this. 
10. Further, this agreement was challenged via a motion to reconsider which
was denied on March 14th, 2024, but Judge Kaitcer. 
11. To date, no findings of fact or conclusions of law have been issued
regarding this ruling despite notifying the court that they are past-due. 
12. At the hearing on March 14th, 2024, the docket reflects only the
Respondent appearing before the court. 
13. Just prior to the hearing, Respondent was served the current orders by
COOPER L. CARTER, not DAN BACALIS, just minutes before the hearing was 
to commence that was filed to challenge them. 
14. Despite the agreement stating that a typed written order shall be
prepared by Dan Bacalis, despite the 20 day time limit, and despite the five day 
review period that all parties and Judge Kaitcer agreed to -  the orders were 
permitted to be prepared at the last minute by COOPER L. CARTER, well after the 
20-day deadline, and despite the Respondent’s consent not being present, he was
ordered to sign the agreement in violation of Texas Law by 1:30 P.M. that same 
day.

15. The above order clearly shows two distinct handwritings – one from
COOPER L. CARTER, and one from Judge Kaitcer – ‘for his business’ – showing 
a pre-determined outcome. 
III. CONCLUSION
16. There is no doubt that this matter is filled with deception and unethical
practices. The Petitioner, in an effort to conceal her marital affair, had no problem 
taking her own children out of their home, falsifying her financial status after 
converting funds from the marital estate with the assistance of a third party,

15. The above order clearly shows two distinct handwritings — one from

COOPER L. CARTER, and one from Judge Kaitcer — ‘for his business’ — showing

a pre-determined outcome.
Ill. CONCLUSION

16. There is no doubt that this matter is filled with deception and unethical
practices. The Petitioner, in an effort to conceal her marital affair, had no problem
taking her own children out of their home, falsifying her financial status after

converting funds from the marital estate with the assistance of a third party,

claiming financial responsibility over property paid for by the Respondent, 
fabricating the existence of protective orders, instigating frivolous eviction suits, 
and falsifying the need for protection. 
17. On December 22, 2023, Petitioner filed for a protective order despite
already claiming to have one in effect in her original petition for divorce, yet text 
evidence clearly shows the Petitioner at home with Respondent on this same day – 
showing no need of protection as they continued to cohabit up until January 16th, 
2024. 
18. There exists no legal basis for the court’s continued stonewalling.
19. Therefore, continued disregard for the well-being of the Children and
Respondent’s rights must cease. 
20. Issue relief by granting summary judgment in Respondent's favor
without delay.
Respectfully submitted,

TO THE HONORABLE 233"! DISTRICT COURT:

Petitioner, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, respectfully submits this motion to strike
Respondent’s answer and motion to consolidate, and in support thereof, would show the court the

following:

I. STATEMENT OF FACTS

1. On March 20, 2025, Respondent, MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS, filed an answer

3. The Respondent’s answer and motion to consolidate were filed on Cooper Carter’s 
behalf by Roderick D. Marx, a party not named in either this suit or the related divorce suit (322-
744263-23). 
 
4. Roderick D. Marx has filed all pleadings on Cooper Carter’s behalf because Cooper 
Carter’s electronic filing manager credentials are registered under the law farm Cantey and 
Hangar, LLP. See Exhibit 1. 
 
5. Respondent’s answer and motion to consolidate are an attempt to subvert the relief the 
children desperately need, and failed to argue as to how these pleadings are in the best interests 
of the children. 
A. Sudden Activity after Months of Delay 
6. Respondent’s Answer asserts the existence of a prior divorce case (Cause No. 322-
744263-23) involving the parties as a basis to delay or abate this Suit Affecting Parent-Child 
Relationship (SAPCR). However, that divorce case has been stalled for months with no 
meaningful action by Respondent or her alleged counsel. Respondent’s counsel has failed to 
diligently prosecute the divorce matter, and a dormant case cannot justify stalling this separate 
SAPCR proceeding. In short, the children’s issues should not be put on hold due to an unrelated 
divorce case that remains inactive. 
B. SAPCR Suit Focus (Lack of Child-Related Response) 
7. This SAPCR is focused on the welfare and best interests of the children, yet the 
Respondent’s Original Answer is devoid of any substantive response regarding the children. 
Respondent merely states that the information required under Texas Family Code §§154.181(b) 
and 154.1815 “will be provided at a later date”and then enters a general denial. No specific

conservatorship, support, or visitation issues are addressed at all. By failing to engage with the 
core child-related allegations in the Petition, Respondent’s Answer is irrelevant to the central 
issues of this proceeding and provides the Court with nothing of substance on the SAPCR 
matters. 
8. Respondent’s Answer claims that it was “necessary for Respondent to secure the 
services of COOPER L. CARTER, a licensed attorney, to prepare and defend this suit”. Yet the 
pleading was filed under the letterhead of Marx, Altman & Johnson (Attorney Roderick D. 
Marx’s firm) and is electronically signed by Cooper L. Carter as “Attorney for Respondent”. 
This inconsistency creates confusion as to who represents Respondent in this case. Texas practice 
expects clarity in counsel of record (see Tex. R. Civ. P. 8 requiring designation of lead counsel), 
but here Respondent’s Answer sends mixed signals by invoking Mr. Carter’s name and services 
while being filed through Mr. Marx’s firm. Such a contradiction in representation is procedurally 
improper and fails to clearly identify the attorney in charge of Respondent’s case. 
9. In addition to the above, there are irregularities in the manner Respondent’s Answer 
was filed. Upon information and belief, the Answer was submitted via an Electronic Filing 
Manager (EFM) account registered to Cooper L. Carter under the law firm Cantey & Hanger, 
which is not the firm appearing on the pleading. In other words, the electronic filing credentials 
used do not match the law firm or attorney officially listed on the document. This raises serious 
concerns about the validity of the filing and compliance with Texas e-filing rules (see Tex. R. 
Civ. P. 21(f)). Filings must be made by the attorney of record under their proper account for 
transparency and proper notice. Using an EFM account associated with a different firm (Cantey 
& Hanger) for a pleading filed under Marx, Altman & Johnson’s banner is a procedural anomaly 
that calls into question whether Respondent’s Answer was filed in accordance with the required

procedures.  Further, the email address COOPERCARTER@MAJADMIN.COM associated with 
the pleadings filed in this court is NOT registered under the EFM in which they were filed. 
10. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 21(f) requires that electronic ﬁlings be made through 
an authorized EFM account corresponding to the attorney of record. The use of an account 
registered under one ﬁrm (Cantey & Hanger) to ﬁle pleadings under a different ﬁrm’s name (Marx, 
Altman & Johnson) constitutes a procedural violation, undermining the validity of the ﬁling and 
raising concerns about whether the attorney of record actually authorized or executed the ﬁling. 
11. This discrepancy calls into question the legitimacy of Respondent’s Answer and 
warrants immediate review by the Court. Given the attorney filing the document did not use 
their own credentials under which the pleading was submitted, yet claimed her individual 
services were necessary, renders the filing as procedurally defective and should be struck 
from the record sua sponte. 
PRAYER FOR RELIEF 
12. Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court strike Respondent’s Original Answer 
and motion to consolidate in its entirety sua sponte. Petitioner further requests that Respondent 
be required to refile any answer or responsive pleading in compliance with all applicable 
procedural rules – including proper attorney-of-record designation and use of correct electronic 
filing credentials – and to ensure that any such pleading addresses the substantive SAPCR issues 
regarding the children. Petitioner also prays for such other and further relief, at law or in equity, 
to which he may be justly entitled.

IN THE 233RD DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THE 233rd DISTRICT COURT: 
1. For the preceding twelve months and fourteen days, Petitioner has been unlawfully
Barred from entering his residence and has been cut out of his children’s lives. On March 6th,  
2024, while walking M.E.M and C.R.M. to school, Respondent unlawfully locked the Petitioner 
out of the matrimonial home and called the Watauga police department who came to assist in the 
dispute. When on scene at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148, Respondent produced an 
agreed associate judge’s report where consent had been withdrawn and used it as a means to bar 
the Petitioner’s entry to the home. With an emergency hearing date set for March 14th, 2024, the 
Petitioner took the advice of the officers and stayed with his father temporarily in Flower 
Mound, Texas to avoid unnecessary conflict.  
2. On March 14th, 2024, the Petitioner appeared in person and was served a reduced copy
of the orders he was in court to challenge and from which he withdrew his consent from. Despite

TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THE 233" DISTRICT COURT:

1. For the preceding twelve months and fourteen days, Petitioner has been unlawfully
Barred from entering his residence and has been cut out of his children’s lives. On March 6",
2024, while walking M.E.M and C.R.M. to school, Respondent unlawfully locked the Petitioner
out of the matrimonial home and called the Watauga police department who came to assist in the
dispute. When on scene at ee, Respondent produced an
agreed associate judge’s report where consent had been withdrawn and used it as a means to bar
the Petitioner’s entry to the home. With an emergency hearing date set for March 14", 2024, the
Petitioner took the advice of the officers and stayed with his father temporarily in Flower
Mound, Texas to avoid unnecessary conflict.

2. On March 14", 2024, the Petitioner appeared in person and was served a reduced copy

of the orders he was in court to challenge and from which he withdrew his consent from. Despite

this, the orders were rendered anyway, effectively barring the Petitioner from his own home and 
Children’s lives despite his consent not being present at the time of rendition.  
 
3. The orders in question, attached hereto as EXHIBIT 1, are facially void and lack legal 
effect. Despite this, they continue to cause ongoing and irreparable harm, as further detailed 
below. Accordingly, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court issue a declaratory judgment 
formally recognizing the invalidity of these orders which will simultaneously provide long-
overdue relief to the children in this matter. In support of this request, the Petitioner shows as 
follows: 
I. STATEMENT OF FACTS 
 
4. On page 1 of the orders, they read as follows: “The parties have agreed to the terms of 
this order as evidenced by the signatures below.” 
 
5. On the final page of the orders, the signatures of CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS and his 
previous attorney, DAN BACALIS, are not present on the document. 
 
6. The Petitioner refused to sign the orders to which he did not consent to on March 14th, 
2024. 
 
7. The orders were rendered on March 26th, 2024, as an agreement between the parties 
despite consent not being present at the time of rendition. 
 
8. The orders are void ab initio and have no legal effect. 
II. ARGUMENT 
A. An “Agreed” Order Without Actual Consent is Void Ab Initio 
9. Texas law is unequivocal that a judgment purporting to rest on an agreement of the 
parties cannot be rendered or enforced if one of the parties did not genuinely consent at the time 
of rendition. The consent of all parties at the time the court renders judgment is a prerequisite for

a valid agreed order. As the Texas Supreme Court has stated, a trial court cannot render a valid 
agreed judgment absent the consent of the parties at the time it is rendered, and the 
agreement can be revoked at any time before judgment is rendered on the agreement.  S & A 
Restaurant Corp. v. Leal, 892 S.W.2d 855, 857 (Tex.1995). This is so because a trial court cannot 
render a valid agreed judgment absent the consent of the parties at the time it is rendered. Padilla 
v. LaFrance, 907 S.W.2d 454, 461 (Tex.1995).  
10. In S&A Restaurant Corp. v. Leal, the Court reaffirmed that a party may revoke 
consent to a settlement at any time before judgment is rendered, and if a court nonetheless signs 
a judgment after consent has been revoked, “a judgment rendered after one party revokes his 
consent is void.” This rule reflects a fundamental principle: true consent is the linchpin of any 
agreed order. 
11. Here, Petitioner never consented to the order at the time they were entered. Indeed, 
his missing signature is a prima facie showing of this fact. Under these circumstances, it was 
error for the Court to sign the order as an “agreed” judgment, and the result is that the order 
is void ab initio. The Texas Supreme Court’s decision in Quintero v. Jim Walter Homes, Inc., 654 
S.W.2d 442 (Tex. 1983) is directly on point. In Quintero, the Court held that when a trial court 
has knowledge that one party does not consent to a judgment, the court “should refuse to 
sanction [the] agreement by making it the judgment of the court.” Id. By entering an order in 
the absence of Petitioner’s consent, the agreed judgment in this case was not just voidable—it is 
absolutely void from inception. In legal effect, there never was a valid temporary order at all, 
because the requisite meeting of the minds was absent. 
12. Texas courts of appeals have applied these principles in situations analogous to 
Petitioner’s, particularly in family law cases. For example, in In re E.B., No. 12-17-00214-CV

(Tex. App.—Tyler Oct. 18, 2017), the trial court had entered temporary orders incorporating a 
Rule 11 settlement agreement regarding conservatorship and possession of children. The father, 
however, had timely revoked his consent to that agreement. The Tyler Court of Appeals held that 
because the father withdrew consent before judgment, the agreed terms regarding 
conservatorship and possession were void. The appellate court unequivocally stated that the 
provisions of the temporary orders involving the children “are void, and the trial court abused 
its discretion in entering temporary orders based on the [purported] Agreement.” The court 
conditionally granted mandamus and directed the trial judge to vacate those portions of the 
temporary order.  
B. A Void Judgment is a Nullity and Can Be Challenged or Vacated at Any Time 
13. Because the temporary orders were entered without jurisdiction (i.e. without consent 
jurisdiction conferred by the parties’ agreement), the resulting “agreed” order is void. Under 
Texas law, a void judgment or order has no legal force or effect from the outset. It is “null” ab 
initio, and any person or court affected by it is entitled to treat it as a nullity. The Texas Supreme 
Court has explained that a void order is, in effect, no order at all: “[A] void judgment is a legal 
nullity . . . .” Alanis v. Barclays Capital Real Estate Inc., No. 04-17-00069-CV (Tex. App. Mar. 
27, 2017).  
14. Such a judgment may be collaterally attacked and set aside at any time, as it is not 
subject to ordinary procedural bars. Browning v. Placke, 698 S.W.2d 362 (Tex. 1985) (per 
curiam), is instructive on this point. In Browning, the Supreme Court recognized that courts of 
equal jurisdiction have the authority to declare a judgment void when it suffers from a 
fundamental defect (such as lack of jurisdiction or lack of consent). Here, this is a direct fit with 
the present situation.

C. Respondent’s most recent attempt to subvert the process 
 
15. On March 20th, 2025, Respondent filed an original answer and motion to consolidate 
through COOPER L. CARTER, which was prepared by RODERICK MARX. These filings are a 
direct showing of the Respondent’s game. She remains silent for months, and then at the first 
sign of her false narrative being under attack, she unleashes her attorney to file pleadings using 
the EFM Credentials of another individual not named in the suit – Roderick Marx – to prevent 
the relief duly entitled to Petitioner. 
 
16. Petitioner reminds this court that Respondent’s answer is clearly a boilerplate 
response template that doesn’t even address the core issues raised in the SAPCR. The first lines 
of the Response claim that Respondent has no driver’s license or social security number, which 
shows the rushed nature of her pleading in an attempt to defend the Respondent’s false narrative 
she has procured through fraud. 
 
17. Petitioner also points out that the Respondent wants to consolidate this matter with 
the divorce matter that is procedurally defunct, which would not be in the best interests of the 
children because it would move the matter back to the procedurally stalled case that hasn’t bene 
prosecuted by the same attorney who is requesting consolidation. Such would defeat the entire 
purpose of this suit, and would cause undue delay and prejudice the children and Petitioner. 
D. Request for immediate re-entry. 
 
18. Given the orders in question are facially void, Petitioner requests an immediate notice 
to be filed and served on the parties of record so that he may return home to his children, 
residence, and place of business until this matter can be set for a hearing. Petitioner’s unlawful 
exclusion from his residence creates further harm to the children each day it is left unaddressed.

The analysis concludes that: 
1. The divorce case should be dismissed for want of prosecution due to Petitioner's failure 
to advance the case for nearly a year 
2. The current orders are void due to lack of consent and improper adoption by the referring 
court 
3. The 322nd District Court never acquired continuing exclusive jurisdiction over the 
children 
4. The new SAPCR was properly filed as an original proceeding and should not be 
consolidated, especially considering no motion to transfer has been filed. 
5. Ms. Carter's pleadings should be stricken due to her failure to respond to a Rule 12 
challenge 
6. The children's best interests require immediate relief without further procedural delays 
I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
A. Procedural History 
1. December 18, 2023: Divorce case filed in 322nd District Court with 60-day waiver. 
2. February 6, 2024: Respondent filed emergency motion challenging basis for agreement. 
3. March 14, 2024: Respondent’s motion was denied, basis for agreement became

Rule of Civil Procedure 165a and the court's inherent power to manage its docket. The Texas 
Supreme Court recognized both bases for dismissal in Villarreal v. San Antonio Truck & 
Equipment, 994 S.W.2d 628 (Tex. 1999).

2. A party seeking affirmative relief has a duty to prosecute the case with due diligence. 
As stated in In re Conner, 458 S.W.3d 532 (Tex. 2015), “[t]he issue here is whether a trial court 
abuses its discretion by refusing to grant a motion to dismiss for want of prosecution in the face 
of unmitigated and unexplained delay. We hold that it does.” Id. 
3. In family law specifically, In re Marriage of Buster, 115 S.W.3d 141 (Tex. App.—
Texarkana 2003) emphasized the importance of moving family law cases toward resolution and 
upheld dismissal after extended inactivity. 
Application to Current Case 
4. The facts strongly support dismissal for want of prosecution: 
i. 
The divorce case has been pending for over 16 months 
ii. Petitioner's attorney has failed to prosecute the case since April 24, 2024 
iii. No substantive action taken for approximately 11 months 
iv. No responses to discovery, no substantive pleadings, no trial settings 
v. The only recent action was filing a Motion to Consolidate to block emergency 
relief 
5. This extended inactivity is precisely the type of conduct that Texas courts have 
consistently held, which justifies dismissal for want of prosecution. The court should dismiss the 
dormant divorce case and allow the new SAPCR to proceed independently to address the 
children's urgent needs.

B. Void Orders Due to Lack of Consent 
Legal Framework 
6. The Texas Supreme Court established in Burnaman v. Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 
(Tex. 1951) that: "A valid consent judgment cannot be rendered by a court when consent of one 
of the parties is wanting. It is not sufficient to support the judgment that a party's consent thereto 
may at one time have been given; consent must exist at the very moment the court undertakes to 
make the agreement the judgment of the court." 
7. The Court further held: "When a trial court has knowledge that one of the parties to a 
suit does not consent to a judgment, it is error to render a judgment purportedly by agreement; 
such a judgment is a nullity." 
8. This principle was reaffirmed in Padilla v. LaFrance, 907 S.W.2d 454 (Tex. 1995), 
which confirmed that a trial court cannot render an agreed judgment after a party has withdrawn 
consent to a settlement. 
Application to Current Case 
9. The orders in this case are void under Burnaman and its progeny because: 
i. 
The orders claim consent of all parties but only bear signatures of the Petitioner 
and counsel 
ii. Respondent contends he never gave consent to the orders 
iii. Respondent actively opposed the terms that locked him out of his home and 
separated him from the children

iv. The court was aware of the dispute regarding consent (Respondent filed an 
emergency motion challenging the basis for agreement) 
10. Under Texas law, if Respondent did not consent to the orders at the time they were 
rendered, they are void ab initio. The court should declare these orders void and vacate them. 
C. Associate Judge's Orders Never Properly Adopted 
Legal Framework 
11. Texas Family Code § 201.013(b) explicitly states: "Except as provided by Section 
201.007 (Powers of Associate Judge), if a request for a de novo hearing before the referring court 
is not timely filed, the proposed order or judgment of the associate judge becomes the order or 
judgment of the referring court only on the referring court's signing the proposed order or 
judgment." 
12. This requirement is mandatory, not discretionary. Without the District Judge's 
signature, the Associate Judge's order remains merely a "proposed" order. 
Application to Current Case 
13. The orders in this case were issued by an Associate Judge but allegedly never 
properly adopted or signed by the referring District Court. Under Texas Family Code § 
201.013(b), these orders never achieved the status of a final judgment of the court and have no 
legal effect as final orders. 
14. This defect alone would be sufficient to challenge their validity, even without the 
consent issues. The court should declare these orders void or vacate them due to the lack of 
proper adoption by the referring court.

D. No Continuing Exclusive Jurisdiction (CEJ) 
Legal Framework 
15. Texas Family Code § 155.001(a) provides: "A court acquires continuing, exclusive 
jurisdiction over the matters provided for by this title in connection with a child on the rendition 
of a final order." 
16. Critically, § 155.001(d) states: "Unless a final order has been rendered by a court of 
continuing, exclusive jurisdiction, a subsequent suit shall be commenced as an original 
proceeding." 
17. In In re Burk, 252 S.W.3d 736 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2008), the court held 
that CEJ is established only upon rendition of a final order, and temporary orders do not establish 
CEJ. 
Application to Current Case 
18. No final order was ever rendered in the divorce case because: 
i. 
The Associate Judge's orders were never properly signed by the referring District 
Court Judge (per § 201.013(b)) 
ii. The orders were void due to lack of consent (per Burnaman v. Heaton) 
19. Without a final order, the 322nd District Court never acquired CEJ over the children. 
Therefore, under § 155.001(d), the Respondent's new SAPCR was properly "commenced as an 
original proceeding" in the 233rd District Court. 
20. The motion to consolidate should be denied because the 322nd District Court does 
not have dominant jurisdiction over the children.

E. Exceptions to Dominant Jurisdiction 
Legal Framework 
           21. Generally, when two suits involving the same subject matter are pending in different 
courts of equal jurisdiction, the court in which the suit was first filed has dominant jurisdiction. 
However, the Texas Supreme Court in Wyatt v. Shaw Plumbing Co., 760 S.W.2d 245, 247 (Tex. 
1988) recognized three exceptions to this rule: 
i. Conduct by a party that estops them from asserting prior active jurisdiction 
ii. Lack of persons to be joined if feasible 
iii. Lack of intent to prosecute the first lawsuit 
Application to Current Case 
         22. Even if the 322nd District Court had dominant jurisdiction (which it does not due to 
lack of CEJ), at least two exceptions to the first-filed rule apply: 
Estoppel by Conduct: 
i. 
Petitioner allowed the case to become completely dormant 
ii. Failed to comply with Rule 237a's notice requirements after federal remand 
iii. Effectively concealed the revival of the state case 
iv. Represented through inaction that she had abandoned the case 
     
Lack of Intent to Prosecute: 
i. 
For nearly a year, Petitioner took no action to advance the divorce

ii. No discovery, no responses, no settings 
iii. Only "revived" the divorce case as a strategic ploy to derail Respondent's 
emergency action 
23. The 233rd District Court is the appropriate forum to hear the current disputes because 
that case was initiated specifically to address the children's urgent needs, free from the 
entanglements of the stalled divorce. 
F. Attorney Misconduct - Rule 12 Challenge 
Legal Framework 
24. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12 provides that a party may file a sworn motion 
stating that they believe a suit is being prosecuted or defended without authority. The challenged 
attorney bears the burden of proving authority to act. If the attorney fails to show authority, the 
court "shall refuse to permit the attorney to appear in the cause and shall strike the pleadings if 
no person who is authorized to prosecute or defend appears." 
25. These consequences are mandatory, not discretionary. The court has no choice but to 
bar the attorney and strike the pleadings upon failure to show authority. 
Application to Current Case 
26. Respondent filed a verified Rule 12 motion on September 20, 2024, challenging 
Cooper L. Carter's authority. Ms. Carter has not responded to this challenge for over 6 months. 
Additional facts supporting the Rule 12 challenge include: 
i. 
Ms. Carter's e-filing account is registered under her prior employer's email 
address

iv. Ms. Carter lacks a current working phone number or email on file with the State 
Bar 
v. Ms. Carter has not produced any client authority or engagement agreement in 14 
months 
27. Under Rule 12, Ms. Carter's failure to respond to the challenge requires the court to 
refuse to permit her to appear in the case and strike all pleadings filed by her, including the 
Motion to Consolidate. 
G. Additional Attorney Misconduct 
 
Discovery Violations 
28. Ms. Carter failed to respond to Requests for Admissions served on September 17, 
2024, resulting in deemed admissions under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 198. She made no 
effort to withdraw or amend these deemed admissions, effectively conceding critical facts against 
her client. 
29. This constitutes a violation of her duties under Rules 193.2 and 193.5 to timely 
respond or amend discovery responses.

Rule 237a Violations 
30. After federal remand on December 6, 2024, Ms. Carter failed to: 
i. 
File the required certified copy of the remand order with the clerk 
ii. Provide Respondent with mandatory written notice of the remand 
31. This procedural violation prevents the case from moving forward properly and further 
demonstrates Ms. Carter's neglect of basic procedural duties. 
Abuse of Process 
31. Ms. Carter's sudden reappearance after nearly a year of inactivity solely to block 
emergency relief suggests improper purpose. Filing a Motion to Consolidate without addressing 
substantive issues appears designed to delay resolution rather than advance the case. 
This conduct violates: 
i. 
Rule 13 of Texas Rules of Civil Procedure (forbidding groundless filings brought 
in bad faith) 
ii. Texas Disciplinary Rule 3.02 (prohibiting positions that unreasonably delay 
resolution) 
H. Children's Best Interests 
Legal Framework 
32. Texas Family Code § 153.002 establishes: "The best interest of the child shall be the 
primary consideration of the court in determining the issues of conservatorship and possession of 
and access to the child."

This paramount standard must guide all decisions in cases involving children. 
Application to Current Case 
33. The children in this case are suffering ongoing harm: 
i. 
Subjected to psychological manipulation and medical neglect 
ii. Left home alone at night without supervision 
iii. Removed from Respondent's care and placed with elderly great-grandparents 
iv. Eldest child's academic performance has plummeted 
v. Emotionally estranged from both parents 
34. Every day that passes without corrective action leaves the children in an unstable, 
harmful environment. Consolidation would reward procedural stonewalling and cause further 
delay. The children's best interests require prompt resolution, which can only be achieved by 
denying consolidation, dismissing the dormant divorce case, and allowing the new SAPCR to 
proceed expeditiously. 
III. CONCLUSION AND RELIEF REQUESTED 
Based on the comprehensive legal analysis above, there are multiple independent grounds 
supporting the Respondent's entitlement to relief: 
1. The divorce case should be dismissed for want of prosecution under Rule 165a and the 
court's inherent power. 
2. The current orders are void due to lack of consent under Burnaman v. Heaton.

4. The 322nd District Court never acquired CEJ under Texas Family Code § 155.001. 
5. Exceptions to dominant jurisdiction apply under Wyatt v. Shaw Plumbing Co. 
6. Ms. Carter's pleadings should be stricken due to her failure to respond to a Rule 12 
challenge. 
7. Ms. Carter has engaged in multiple instances of misconduct warranting sanctions and 
referral to the State Bar. 
8. The children's best interests require immediate relief without further procedural delays 
Therefore, the Respondent is entitled to the following relief: 
i. Denial of Petitioner's Motion to Consolidate. 
ii. Declaration that the current orders are void and of no legal effect. 
iii. Dismissal of the divorce action (Cause No. 322-744263-23) for want of prosecution. 
iv. Striking of all pleadings filed by Cooper L. Carter due to her failure to show 
authority. 
v. Permission for the new SAPCR to proceed in the 233rd District Court to address the 
children's urgent needs. 
These remedies are supported by well-established Texas law and are necessary to protect the 
children's best interests, ensure procedural fairness, and maintain the integrity of the legal 
process. Without any opposition, the court has every ability to act.

NO. 233-765358-25 
 
IN THE 233RD DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
 
 
TO THE HONORABLE COURT: 
 
Petitioner, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, submits this notice to provide a different 
perspective into the current situation: 
I. BEFORE AND AFTER 
1. This side-by-side comparison illustrates the stark differences in the children’s 
quality of life, parental involvement, and household stability before and after the removal of 
the Father from the family home. It presents a clear, fact-based evaluation of how the familial 
environment, care structure, and overall wellbeing of the children have been significantly 
impacted. Each point demonstrates a substantial decline in stability, support, and morality—
raising urgent concerns about the children’s best interests, safety, and development under the 
current arrangement.

Petitioner, which is simply to return to the residence that he was unlawfully removed from so 
that he can begin rebuilding the status quo of the children. Finally, we compare the benefits

• Children will have help with 
homework from home and help 
preparing for STAR Testing. 
• The respondent will have to choose 
between co-habitation or reside in an 
alternate residence near-by. 
• Children will have frequent and 
continuous access to both parents. 
 
• Financial damages can be repaired. 
 
 
VII. CONCLUSION 
 
This situation is destructive, and truly a one-sided case. Respondent’s prolonged silence, 
in fact, says everything. Without any arguments or opposition on record, it begs the question as 
to how this situation has been permitted to persist as long as it has. The only drawbacks of 
granting relief fall on the Respondent – and are minor inconveniences at best that can never 
outweigh the benefits that the children would reap if relief were to be granted. All the Petitioner 
asked for in the beginning was time. Now, time has been wasted, and we remain in the same 
spot. The point is – the Mother cannot just fabricate family violence to have Father removed 
from the home – especially when she knew and benefitted from his at-home business operations 
which have since been significantly damaged. Despite all the harm done, the Petitioner is 
confident that it can be repaired, the family  can get back on track, and this process can be 
finalized without sacrificing the stability and well-being of the children that they have been 
accustomed to throughout their lives.

months of inaction, is seeking to set an improperly filed consolidation motion used as a tactic to 
stall emergency relief. 
Notably, the participation from Petitioner resurfaces again only in the face of an 
emergency TRO. It doesn’t come with good faith or arguments; it only comes with a false sense 
of urgency by the opposing counsel in this matter. This court has sat on its’ hands for months, 
and then despite the failure to prosecute from the other side, it chooses to act on the wrong 
motion. Such a display is legally improper, unjustified, and showcases the complete disregard for 
what would otherwise be a prima facie case warranting dismissal for want of prosecution.  
Now, rather than acting sua sponte to set the DWOP for hearing, the court instead 
chooses to entertain a prematurely filed consolidation motion which it has no jurisdiction to rule 
on. As the Texas Supreme Court has held previously: “[a] plaintiff has a duty to “prosecut[e] the 
suit to a conclusion with reasonable diligence,” failing which a trial court may dismiss for want 
of prosecution.” In re Conner, 458 S.W.3d 532 (Tex. 2015) (citing Callahan v. Staples, 139 Tex. 
8, 161 S.W.2d 489, 491 (1942)). The court has wide discretion to manage its’ docket, so it begs 
the question as to why the court wants to act on its own accord on a motion to consolidate before 
the case is properly transferred. 
Although the writ of prohibition is intended to prevent this Court from setting a matter 
for hearing that is procedurally improper, the issue in this case mirrors that addressed by the 
Texas Supreme Court in In re Conner, 458 S.W.3d 532 (Tex. 2015). There, the Court considered 
whether a trial court abuses its discretion by refusing to grant a motion to dismiss for want of 
prosecution in the face of unmitigated and unexplained delay—and held that it does. That is 
precisely the circumstance presented here, and this intended writ of prohibition is to prevent this

jurisdiction to rule on, and give the court the ability to dismiss this case for want of prosecution 
given that it has the discretion to do so, and no opposition to it from the opposing party. 
II. LEGAL FRAMEWORK 
A. Writ of Prohibition 
A writ of prohibition is an extraordinary legal remedy that serves specific, limited 
purposes in the Texas legal system. It is a judicial order issued by a higher court to prevent a 
lower court from exceeding its jurisdiction or interfering with the higher court's determination of 
a case. 
Key characteristics of a writ of prohibition include: 
1. Limited Purpose Remedy: A writ of prohibition is used to protect the subject matter of 
an appeal or to prohibit unlawful interference with enforcement of a superior court's 
judgment (Sivley v. Sivley, 972 S.W.2d 850, 863, Tex. App.—Tyler 1998). 
2. Preventive Nature: The writ is designed to prevent future actions, not to remedy acts 
already completed. It can only be used to prevent what is about to be or could be done, 
not as a remedy for acts that are already completed (United States v. Hoffman, 71 U.S. 
158, 1866). Here, Respondent seeks to use this writ as a means to prevent the court from 
causing further delays by setting opposing counsel’s improper motion to consolidate. 
3. Extraordinary Remedy: Courts have characterized a writ of prohibition as a "drastic 
remedy" and the legal equivalent of an equitable injunction (In re Lewis, 223 S.W.3d 756, 
761, Tex. App.—Texarkana 2007). This is a drastic circumstance. The Respondent has

jurisdiction to rule on, and give the court the ability to dismiss this case for want of prosecution

given that it has the discretion to do so, and no opposition to it from the opposing party.

Ul. LEGAL FRAMEWORK

A. Writ of Prohibition

A writ of prohibition is an extraordinary legal remedy that serves specific, limited
purposes in the Texas legal system. It is a judicial order issued by a higher court to prevent a
lower court from exceeding its jurisdiction or interfering with the higher court's determination of

a Case.

1. Limited Purpose Remedy: A writ of prohibition is used to protect the subject matter of
an appeal or to prohibit unlawful interference with enforcement of a superior court's

judgment (Sivley v. Sivley, 972 S.W.2d 850, 863, Tex. App.—Tyler 1998).

causing further delays by setting opposing counsel’s improper motion to consolidate.

remedy" and the legal equivalent of an equitable injunction (/n re Lewis, 223 S.W.3d 756,

761, Tex. App.—Texarkana 2007). This is a drastic circumstance. The Respondent has

been barred from his own residence for over a year without any explanation, and without 
any case prosecution in a one-sided effort to obtain relief from facially void orders. 
4. Last Resort: Prohibition is not appropriate if any other remedy, such as appeal, is 
available and adequate (In re Castle Tex. Prod. Ltd. P'ship, 189 S.W.3d 400, 404, Tex. 
App.—Tyler 2006). Here, Respondent has no adequate remedy by appeal, because there 
is currently no court with continuous, exclusive jurisdiction over the children in this 
matter. 
III. STATEMENT OF FACTS 
5. On January 24, 2025, after more than 11 months of inaction, Petitioner filed a Motion 
to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution in this court. The divorce case has had no substantive action 
from Petitioner since April 2024, a legal ghost ship drifting without direction or purpose. That 
motion wasn’t attempted to be set for hearing until September of 2024, only after the 
Respondent exhausted all efforts seeking relief throughout the Texas Judiciary without any 
participation from the opposing side. 
6. On March 19, 2025, driven by mounting concerns about the children’s welfare and 
learning that the 322nd District Court did not have continuous, exclusive jurisdiction over the 
children in this matter, Petitioner filed a new SAPCR in the 233rd District Court (Cause No. 233-
765358-25) seeking emergency relief for the children. The very next day, March 20, 2025, Ms. 
Carter suddenly reappeared like a character presumed missing in the second act, filing an answer 
to the SAPCR petition in this Court and thereby submitting to this Court’s jurisdiction by filing a 
response rather than a motion to abate.

7. On March 21, 2025, Respondent filed a verified Rule 12 motion challenging Ms. 
Carter’s authority in the 233rd to represent Petitioner in the matter—the second such challenge, 
met with the same resounding silence as the first. 
8. On March 25, 2025, Respondent filed an Objection to Consolidation and an Ex-Parte 
Emergency Motion for TRO in the 233rd. Two days later, on March 27, 2025, Respondent 
contacted the court coordinator, requested a date and time to present the motion, and served the 
documents to the opposing party with the intent to present on March 28, 2025, at 9:00 A.M. 
before the Associate Judge of this Court. On that fateful morning of March 28, 2025, Respondent 
drove to the courthouse, paid for parking, met with the coordinator, communicated with 
opposing counsel, and secured a hearing date of April 10, 2025 agreed by the parties. 
Respondent then proceeded to the Associate Judge’s courtroom to present the TRO. 
9. Before Respondent could present his case—before he could speak a single word about 
his children’s welfare—he was told that Ms. Carter would be filing a motion to consolidate in the 
322nd District Court, that his motion was improperly before the 233rd court, and the Associate 
Judge refused to hear the motion. It was a curious thing, this refusal. Ms. Carter wasn’t even 
present in the courtroom, yet her words carried more weight than Respondent’s physical 
presence, his properly filed papers, and most importantly, the urgent needs of his children. She 
stopped the proceedings with nothing more than word of mouth for the incorrect motion. A true 
showcasing of disregard for the process, and the children. 
10. On April 2, 2025, Respondent filed a Pre-Objection to Motion to Consolidate in the 
322nd District Court. Ms. Carter’s motion to consolidate wasn’t filed with the 322nd District 
Court until April 3, 2025, six days after she used its mere possibility to prevent the 233rd Court

Court until April 3, 2025, six days after she used its mere possibility to prevent the 233rd Court

from hearing Respondent’s emergency motion. Her motion disregarded Respondent’s pre-
objection entirely, as if it were invisible ink on the page. 
11. On April 4, 2025, unable to acquire a ruling due to Respondent’s objection, Ms. 
Carter attempted to set the motion for a hearing before the 322nd District Court. That same day, 
Respondent filed a Pre-Objection to Motion to Transfer in the 233rd Court, given that a motion 
to transfer must come before any attempt at consolidation. Ms. Carter, who had been so urgently 
concerned about consolidation when it served to block Respondent’s emergency hearing, 
suddenly claimed to be unavailable until late April—causing significant delays that could have 
been avoided had the 233rd Court simply heard the motion before it on March 28, 2025. 
12. Throughout this period of procedural maneuvering, the children have been subjected 
to psychological manipulation and medical neglect. They have been removed from Petitioner’s 
care and placed with elderly great-grandparents on a daily basis, and are being gaslighted into a 
false belief that the divorce is finalized. Respondent’s eldest child’s academic performance has 
plummeted, and both children have become emotionally estranged from both parents. 
Respondent has suffered approximately $110,500 in verifiable financial damages due to being 
locked out of his home and business, and it grows each day. But the financial toll pales in 
comparison to the emotional cost of watching Respondent’s children suffer while the courts 
exchange procedurally incorrect volleys over his head.  
IV. THE PROHIBITION PREDICAMENT 
13. The writ of prohibition exists for precisely this sort of situation—where a court is 
about to act in a way that exceeds its authority and threatens to compound an already untenable 
situation. The law on this matter is as clear as a bell on a still morning:

A. The Procedural Parade Must Follow Its Proper Order 
14. The Texas Family Code establishes a clear sequence for the consolidation of cases 
from different courts. First, a motion to transfer must be filed and granted, bringing both cases 
into the same court. Only then may a motion to consolidate be considered. See Tex. Fam. Code 
§§ 155.201 and 6.407. 
15. This isn't merely a matter of dotting i's and crossing t's—it's the fundamental roadmap 
that ensures cases proceed in an orderly fashion. A court cannot consolidate what it does not 
possess, any more than a chef can cook ingredients that haven't yet been delivered to the kitchen. 
16. The Texas Supreme Court has consistently held that courts must follow proper 
procedural sequence. In re Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., 35 S.W.3d 602, 605 (Tex. 2000). When a 
court attempts to rule on a matter for which it lacks jurisdiction or authority, prohibition is the 
appropriate remedy. In re Lewis, 223 S.W.3d 756, 761 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2007, orig. 
proceeding). 
17. Respondent is no legal scholar with a library of case law memorized, but even he can 
see that this principle is as plain as a full moon on a cloudless night. This Court's potential 
willingness to hear a motion to consolidate before a motion to transfer has been filed and granted 
would be like a judge sentencing a defendant before the trial has begun—a clear inversion of the 
proper order of legal proceedings. 
B. The Discretion Dilemma 
18. The writ of prohibition as used in Texas has three functions:  1) preventing 
interference with higher courts in deciding a pending appeal, 2) preventing inferior courts from 
entertaining suits that will relitigate controversies which have already been settled by issuing

would be like a judge sentencing a defendant before the trial has begun—a clear inversion of the

proper order of legal proceedings.

B. The Discretion Dilemma

18. The writ of prohibition as used in Texas has three functions: 1) preventing
interference with higher courts in deciding a pending appeal, 2) preventing inferior courts from
entertaining suits that will relitigate controversies which have already been settled by issuing

8 
 
courts, and 3) prohibiting a trial court's action when it affirmatively appears that the court lacks 
jurisdiction. Texas Capital Bank-Westwood v. Johnson, 864 S.W.2d 186, 187 (Tex.App.-
Texarkana 1993, orig. proceeding). Here, function three is directly relevant. A court cannot hear a 
motion to consolidate a case it does not have before it.  
C. Opposing Counsel's Conduct 
19. Ms. Carter's behavior throughout this saga deserves special attention, like a character 
in a novel whose actions consistently contradict their stated intentions. 
20. She abandoned the divorce case for nearly a year, filing nothing since April 2024, 
only to suddenly reappear when Respondent sought emergency relief for the children—like a 
firefighter who ignores a smoldering house for months, only to rush in when someone else calls 
for help. 
21. She filed an answer in the 233rd Court, thereby submitting to its jurisdiction, only to 
then argue that the case belongs in this Court—a contradiction as glaring as claiming to be both 
inside and outside a room simultaneously. 
22. She used the mere possibility of a future filing to block an emergency hearing, then 
waited six days to file the motion—a delay that speaks volumes about the true urgency of the 
matter. 
23. She filed a motion to consolidate without first filing a motion to transfer, putting the 
procedural cart before the horse in a manner that defies both logic and law.

24. She now claims to be unavailable until late April, creating further delay after using 
the urgency of consolidation to block Respondent’s emergency hearing—a scheduling 
contradiction that would be comical if not for the children caught in its web. 
25. This pattern reveals a tactical attempt to manipulate both courts' dockets to prevent 
me from obtaining timely relief. It's a shell game played with Respondent’s children's welfare as 
the prize. This Court should not allow itself to be used as an instrument in such procedural 
gamesmanship, particularly when children's lives hang in the balance. 
V. MORAL FIBER 
26. If there's a lesson to be drawn from this procedural quagmire, it's that the law's 
complexity should never obscure its fundamental purpose: to provide justice, particularly for 
those most vulnerable. My children—innocent bystanders in this adult conflict—have become 
collateral damage in a game of procedural chess where the rules seem to change with each move. 
27. It has been stated that the true measure of a society is found in how it treats its most 
vulnerable members. By that measure, the procedural labyrinth that has prevented the 233rd 
Court from hearing Respondent’s emergency motion, and now threatens to compound the error 
by having this Court act prematurely, speaks volumes about how far we have strayed from the 
ideal of justice. 
28. Respondent provide this notice not out of anger or vindictiveness, but out of that 
quiet, bewildered astonishment that settles in a person's bones when they've witnessed the law 
being twisted into shapes that would make a carnival contortionist blush with envy. Respondent 
followed the rules. He honored the procedures. He placed his faith in a system that promised 
justice would flow like water, clear and unobstructed, to those who seek it properly.

29. Behind every case number, behind every filing, behind every procedural rule, there 
are real children with real lives that continue whether the courts act or not. Time doesn't stop for 
them while adults sort out procedural disagreements. They grow, they hurt, they form memories 
and impressions that will shape them for a lifetime. 
30. As Mark Twain might have observed, the difference between proper procedure and 
improper procedure is not merely academic—it's the difference between justice served and 
justice denied, between children protected and children neglected, between a system that works 
and one that merely pretends to. 
VI. CONCLUSION AND PRAYER 
31. I respectfully request that this Court pause, reflect on the procedural peculiarity 
before it, and decline to hear a motion to consolidate until the proper preliminary steps have been 
taken. Specifically, I ask that this Court: 
a. Recognize that it lacks jurisdiction to hear a motion to consolidate until a motion to 
transfer has been filed in the 233rd Court and granted; 
b. Take judicial notice that Petitioner submitted to the 233rd Court's jurisdiction by 
answering the SAPCR petition; 
c. Acknowledge the improper procedural sequence attempted by Petitioner's counsel in 
filing a motion to consolidate without first filing a motion to transfer; 
d. Consider that proceeding with a hearing on the consolidation motion would only 
compound the procedural irregularities and further delay relief for the children;

e. Recognize that the 233rd Court has the power and jurisdiction to address the 
emergency concerns raised in my TRO motion, which remains unopposed on the record. 
f. Using the court’s own inherent power, dismiss the divorce outright for failure to 
prosecute given the circumstances of this case. 
Respondent understands that in most situations, courts give deference to licensed attorneys over 
self-represented litigants. But the procedural impropriety here is so glaring, so fundamental, that 
it transcends the usual presumptions. Even a layperson can see that you cannot consolidate what 
you do not possess, just as you cannot serve a meal with ingredients you haven't yet purchased. 
The children deserve better than to have their fate determined by procedural sleight of hand. 
They deserve courts that follow the law's clear sequence, that prioritize substance over form, and 
that remember that behind every procedural rule are real lives hanging in the balance. The truth 
of this matter can only be revealed once the injustices are duly corrected by this court. 
 
Respondent has filed a similar notice to the 233rd court informing of the intent to file a 
writ of mandamus to compel a ruling on the emergency TRO that was unlawfully blocked from 
being heard by COOPER L. CARTER.

15. The court, at this point, is choosing to not grant relief despite having no reason 
to do so. 
16. This litigation has no possible means to an end, and it should be dismissed 
outright so that the SAPCR may continue. 
17. There has been no filed opposition, objection, or arguments made against the 
Respondent’s position in either suit. 
18. The Petitioner has wasted everyone’s time, caused significant damage, and 
remains hidden in fear of being held accountable. 
19. The Petitioner prioritized an extramarital affair over prosecuting the divorce, 
and the children and Respondent have been significantly harmed. 
Therefore, this case should be dismissed as a matter of law. Every day causes more 
irreparable harm, and this court has every ability and reason to rectify this situation immediately. 
Respondent already has the solution and has been the only party in this matter seeking relief. It is 
simply unacceptable to permit this to continue.

Statement of the Case 
Nature of Underlying Proceeding: This original proceeding arises from a Suit 
Affecting the Parent-Child Relationship ("SAPCR") involving two minor children, 
M.E.M. and C.R.M., in which Relator filed an emergency ex parte application for 
temporary restraining order ("TRO") in the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County, 
Texas. The underlying SAPCR (Cause No. 233-765358-25) was a new proceeding 
initiated by Relator on March 19, 2025, and was answered on March 20, 2025. 
There is a related divorce matter (322-744263-23) that has not been prosecuted 
since April 24, 2024, and no final orders have been rendered. Relator seeks 
declaratory and injunctive relief preventing the Real Party in Interest from barring 
Relator’s from accessing his home, business, and children until valid orders are 
rendered that reflect the children’s best interests. 
Respondent Judge: The Respondent Judge, Kate Stone, is the presiding Associate 
Judge of the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County, Texas. Her office is located at 
200 E. Weatherford St. 5th Floor Fort Worth, TX 76196-0227. 
Respondent’s Challenged Actions and inaction: The trial court refused to hear 
an emergency motion before it on March 28, 2025, and used out-of-court 
statements made by the opposing counsel regarding a forward looking 
consolidation motion that would be filed at a later date, and denied to hear the 
motion after a full hearing date was agreed upon by both parties for April 10, 2025.

Issues Presented 
 
B. Are the March 14, 2024, temporary orders rendered by an Associate 
Judge void ab initio because they explicitly state that all parties agree to 
the terms of the order yet only contain the signatures of the opposing 
party and were never properly adopted by the referring court? 
 
C. Did the Respondent abuse her discretion by failing to perform a clear 
ministerial duty when she refused to consider and rule on Relator's 
properly filed ex parte emergency Application for TRO? 
 
D. Did the Respondent further abuse her discretion un-setting the matter for 
a hearing, and favoring a forward-looking consolidation motion as the 
grounds for denying to hear the emergency TRO before a transfer was 
filed? 
 
E. The Relator has been left without an adequate remedy for an appeal 
because no order resulted from the Respondent judge’s refusal to act on 
Relator’s emergency TRO. 
 
F. Did the Respondent clearly abuse her discretion by excluding any 
exhibits related to the emergency TRO?

Issues Presented

. Are the March 14, 2024, temporary orders rendered by an Associate

Judge void ab initio because they explicitly state that all parties agree to
the terms of the order yet only contain the signatures of the opposing

party and were never properly adopted by the referring court?

. Did the Respondent abuse her discretion by failing to perform a clear

ministerial duty when she refused to consider and rule on Relator's

properly filed ex parte emergency Application for TRO?

. Did the Respondent further abuse her discretion un-setting the matter for

a hearing, and favoring a forward-looking consolidation motion as the
grounds for denying to hear the emergency TRO before a transfer was

filed?

. The Relator has been left without an adequate remedy for an appeal

because no order resulted from the Respondent judge’s refusal to act on

Relator’s emergency TRO.

. Did the Respondent clearly abuse her discretion by excluding any

exhibits related to the emergency TRO?

ARGUMENT 
A. Mandamus Standard 
Mandamus relief is not merely appropriate but imperative in this case 
because the trial court's inaction and the continued enforcement of a void order 
constitute a clear abuse of discretion for which Relator has no adequate remedy at 
law. The Texas Supreme Court has consistently and unequivocally held that to 
obtain mandamus relief, a Relator must show (1) the trial court clearly abused its 
discretion or violated a duty imposed by law, and (2) there is no adequate remedy 
by appeal. In re Bass, 113 S.W.3d 735, 738 (Tex. 2003) (orig. proceeding); Walker 
v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 839 (Tex. 1992). 
Texas jurisprudence firmly establishes that mandamus will lie to correct a 
void order, even without a traditional showing of inadequate appellate remedy. As 
the Supreme Court of Texas definitively stated in Urbish v. 127th Judicial Dist. 
Court, 708 S.W.2d 429, 431 (Tex. 1986) (orig. proceeding), mandamus will issue 
to correct a void order, i.e., an order the trial court had no power or jurisdiction to 
render. The Court has further emphasized in In re Sw. Bell Tel. Co., 35 S.W.3d 602, 
605 (Tex. 2000) (orig. proceeding) that if an order is void, the Relator need not 
show he lacks an adequate appellate remedy, and mandamus relief is appropriate. 
This principle was recently reaffirmed in In re J.R., No. 02-21-00060-CV, 2021 
WL 1421440 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth Apr. 15, 2021, orig. proceeding), where the

v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 839 (Tex. 1992).

Texas jurisprudence firmly establishes that mandamus will lie to correct a

court explicitly stated: "A trial court abuses its discretion if it enters a void order, 
and mandamus will issue to remedy the void order regardless of whether the relator 
has an adequate remedy by appeal." 
B. The temporary orders rendered on March 14, 2024, are void ab initio 
A fundamental and inviolable principle in Texas jurisprudence is that a 
judgment based on a settlement requires the consent of both parties at the time it is 
rendered by the court. The Texas Supreme Court's seminal decision in Burnaman v. 
Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 (1951) established the bedrock principle that a party 
is free to withdraw their consent to a settlement at any time before the judgment is 
rendered. The Court's language was unambiguous and leaves no room for 
interpretation: "A valid consent judgment cannot be rendered by a court when 
consent of one of the parties thereto is wanting. It is not sufficient that a party's 
consent may at one time have been given; consent must exist at the very moment 
the court undertakes to make the agreement the judgment of the court." Id. This 
principle has been consistently reaffirmed, as in Carter v. Carter, 535 S.W.2d 215 
(Tex. Civ. App. 1976), which emphasized that "the law seems to be clear that a 
consent judgment cannot be rendered by a trial court when consent of one of the 
parties is lacking, even though that consent may have been previously given." 
In the present case, the only orders rendered by any court were rendered as 
consent judgments but lack the signatures of all parties. The orders themselves

explicitly state "As evidenced by the signatures below, all parties agree to the terms 
of this order" on page 1, APP 2.1, and later page 38 states "APPROVED AND 
CONSENTED TO AS TO BOTH FORM AND SUBSTANCE" yet crucially lacks 
the signature of the Relator and his prior counsel. APP 2.38. The Court must 
recognize that the absence of the Relator’s signature is not a mere technical 
deficiency but a fatal jurisdictional flaw that renders the orders void ab initio. 
Because his signature was required to effectuate consent, and the orders themselves 
acknowledge this requirement, the orders are unquestionably void. 
C. Outright refusing to hear the emergency TRO is a clear abuse of discretion  
It is well-settled and beyond legitimate dispute that a trial court has a 
ministerial duty to consider and rule on motions that have been properly filed and 
brought to the court's attention. The Texas Court of Appeals has emphatically 
stated, "When a motion is properly filed and pending before the trial court, the act 
of giving consideration to and ruling upon that motion is a ministerial act, and 
mandamus may issue to compel the trial judge to act." Safety-Kleen Corp. v. 
Garcia, 945 S.W.2d 268, 269 (Tex. App.- San Antonio 1997, orig. proceeding). To 
establish an abuse of discretion for refusal to rule, the relator must show: (1) the 
trial court had a legal duty to perform a nondiscretionary act, (2) the relator 
requested performance of that act, and (3) the trial court failed or refused to do so.

In re Shredder Co., L.L.C., 225 S.W.3d 676, 679 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2006, orig. 
proceeding). 
Here, the Relator properly filed his emergency TRO application in the 233rd 
District Court, meticulously followed all procedural requirements, and appeared at 
the scheduled time to present at 9:00 A.M. on March 28, 2025. SUPP 2.11 The 
Court must recognize that the court's refusal to even consider the application—
based solely on an opposing counsel's unverified, informal representation about a 
future filing in another court—constitutes a clear and inexcusable failure to 
perform a ministerial duty – especially when no response or opposition to the TRO 
was filed by the opposing party and that same party was permitted to interfere with 
the proceedings without being present in the courtroom. SUPP 2.19 
The refusal is particularly troubling because 1) The TRO application 
involved un-opposed allegations of immediate harm to children, which courts are 
obligated to address promptly; 2) the refusal was due to a forward looking 
consolidation motion; 3) even if a motion to consolidate had been filed, it would 
not automatically divest the 233rd Court of jurisdiction until actually granted; and 
4) the proper procedure would have been a motion to transfer, not consolidation. 
See Tex. Fam. Code § 6.407. This misapplication of the law resulted in the refusal 
to hear a properly filed motion to favor a procedurally improper motion that hadn’t 
even been filed yet.

In In re Blakeney, 254 S.W.3d 659, 661 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2008, orig. 
proc.), the court held that mandamus is appropriate when a trial court refuses to 
rule on a properly filed motion and the relator has no adequate remedy by appeal. 
That is precisely the situation here. The 233rd Court's refusal to even consider 
Relator's emergency TRO application has left him with no forum to address his 
urgent concerns about the children's welfare, as the case before the 322nd has been 
procedurally abandoned and Relator has been seeking relief from facially void 
temporary orders to no avail since March 14, 2024, without any opposition from 
the opposing counsel. SUPP 3.2 
D. Improper consolidation does not justify the refusal to act 
The 233rd Court’s refusal to act was based on a fundamentally flawed legal 
premise: that the 322nd District Court had continuing exclusive jurisdiction over 
the children. Under Texas Family Code § 155.001, a court acquires continuing 
exclusive jurisdiction over children only when it renders a “final order” in a 
SAPCR. It is undisputed that the 322nd Court never rendered any final order 
regarding the children. Without a final order, the 322nd Court never acquired 
continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the children. Therefore, the 233rd Court 
was entirely within its authority to hear and rule on Relator’s emergency TRO 
application pursuant to § 155.001.

temporary orders to no avail since March 14, 2024, without any opposition from
the opposing counsel. SUPP 3.2
D. Improper consolidation does not justify the refusal to act

The 233rd Court’s refusal to act was based on a fundamentally flawed legal
premise: that the 322nd District Court had continuing exclusive jurisdiction over
the children. Under Texas Family Code § 155.001, a court acquires continuing
exclusive jurisdiction over children only when it renders a “final order” in a
SAPCR. It is undisputed that the 322nd Court never rendered any final order
regarding the children. Without a final order, the 322nd Court never acquired
continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the children. Therefore, the 233rd Court
was entirely within its authority to hear and rule on Relator’s emergency TRO

application pursuant to § 155.001.

Moreover, even if the 322nd Court had continuing exclusive jurisdiction 
(which it does not), the proper procedure would have been a motion to transfer 
under the Family Code, not consolidation. Consolidation is appropriate for related 
cases within the same court, not for transferring jurisdiction between courts. By 
refusing to act based on an anticipated consolidation motion, the 233rd Court 
fundamentally misapplied the law, as consolidation cannot be effectuated prior to 
the transfer of the action. Tex. Fam. Code § 6.407. 
Rather, opposing counsel could have filed a plea in abatement but instead 
chose to Respond to the SAPCR after not prosecuting the divorce case since April 
24, 2024. 
E. Relator has been left with no adequate remedy by an appeal 
 
Because the 233rd District Court outright refused to hear the emergency 
TRO before it and the appearance before the court produced no order, the Relator 
has been left without an adequate remedy for an appeal. The Texas Supreme Court 
has recognized that mandamus relief is appropriate when "a party's ability to 
present a viable claim or defense is vitiated or severely compromised." In re 
Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 136 (Tex. 2004). That is precisely the 
situation here. The Relator has diligently sought relief in a one-sided case to no 
avail, and the 233rd SAPCR was opened to escape the abandoned divorce suit that 
hasn't been prosecuted since April 24th, 2024, and has no valid orders in effect.

F. Refusal to accept relevant exhibits central to the emergency TRO 
 
On April 9th, 2025, Relator attempted to file a NOTICE OF INCLUSION 
with the trial court, which included critical exhibits related to the emergency TRO. 
The Judge refused outright to permit Relator to include any exhibits related to the 
TRO in the rejection comments. SUPP 2.13, 2.16 When contacting the clerk's 
office, no substantive response was received from the court coordinator. The 
returned comment stated: "Judge’s request. Please resubmit without the attached 
exhibits" without citing any legal authority, statute, rule, or local procedure 
justifying this rejection. SUPP 1.1. 
This rejection by the clerk constitutes a clear violation of the Texas Rules of 
Civil Procedure. Rule 21(f)(11) states: "The clerk may not refuse to file a 
document that fails to conform with this rule." Instead, the rule provides that the 
clerk "may identify the error to be corrected and state a deadline for the party to 
resubmit the document in a conforming format." Here, the clerk provided no 
specific error to be corrected, and no legal basis for the rejection outside of “we are 
unable to accept any exhibits into the case”. SUPP 1.1 By doing so, the Relator has 
been deprived of essential privileges to make a record pursuant to Tex. Const Art. 
1, § 19. 
Moreover, Rule 59 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure states: “Notes, 
accounts, bonds, mortgages, records, and all other written instruments,

attached or filed and referred to as such, or by copying the same in the body of the 
pleading in aid and explanation of the allegations in the petition or answer made in

The request to remove the exhibits specifically for the emergency TRO without 
any statutory backing raises suspicion that the trial court is actively trying to 
prevent the record from being properly established. 
Finally, by rejecting exhibits central to Relator's emergency TRO application 
without legal justification, the clerk has effectively denied Relator the ability to 
make a complete record and present all relevant evidence to this court, thereby 
impairing Relator's due process rights. The rejected exhibits have been served on 
the opposing party and will be included in the supplemental record pursuant to Tex. 
R. App. P. § 52.7(b). 
 
CONCLUSION AND PRAYER 
 
Relator has been seeking relief for his children for over a year while the  
opposing party has failed to prosecute their case. They obtained orders by falsely 
claiming consent and then abandoned their case. There have been no filed 
responses to any relief sought by the Relator, no objections filed, and if the Relator

that the real party in interest ever intended to move the dormant divorce proceeding 
towards final trial. There are no valid, legally binding orders in effect, yet they

3. Standing
The law allows me to file this case because | am: (Check one.)
[] the mother of the child(ren).

[Ml the “legal father’ of the child(ren). An Acknowledgment of Paternity form has been signed and filed
with the Vital Statistics Unit for each child. A copy of each Acknowledgment of Paternity is attached to
this Petition.

[] a person who has had actual care, control, and possession of the child(ren) for at least 6 months
ending not more than 90 days before the date this Petition is filed with the Court. | am not a foster
parent.

CL] a person who lived with the child(ren) and the child(ren)’s parent, guardian, or managing conservator
for at least 6 months ending not more than 90 days before the date this Petition is filed with the Court,
and the child(ren)’s parent, guardian, or managing conservator is now dead.

[] the grandparent, great-grandparent, sister, brother, aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew of the child(ren)
and: (Check the box below that applies to your case.)

[] both parents are dead.
[1] both parents, the surviving parent, or managing conservator agree to me filing this case.

[] the child(ren)’s present circumstances will significantly impair (harm) the child(ren)’s physical
health or emotional development.

[] other:
(Read the law about standing in Texas Family Code Sections 102.003, 102.004 and 102.006)

Note: If you are the mother or biological father of the child/ren and an Acknowledgment of Paternity form has
not been signed and filed for each child, you may need to file a paternity case instead of a Suit Affecting the

Parent-Child Relationship (SAPCR) case. Get information about filing a paternity case at
www. TexasLawHelp.org.

4. Jurisdiction

There are no court orders about any of the child(ren). No other Court has continuing jurisdiction over this
case or the child(ren).

Texas has authority to decide this case because: (Check one.)
[ml The children live in Texas now and have lived in Texas for at least the past 6 months or since birth.

[] The children do not live in Texas now, but they have been gone from Texas less than 6 months. The
children had lived in Texas for at least 6 months before they moved. A parent or person acting as a
parent continues to live in Texas.

Important: Talk to a lawyer if neither of the above applies.

M.2055

Note: If there is already a court order about any of the children, you may need to file a modification case instead
of a Suit Affecting the Parent-Child Relationship (SAPCR) case. Get information about filing a modification case

at www. TexasLawHelp.org.

IN THE 233RD DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT: 
I. INTRODUCTION
There comes a time in the journey of life when a man finds himself standing 
in the same muddy footprints he left as a child, gazing up at the same towering 
courthouse steps, and feeling that same sinking sensation in his chest. It’s a peculiar 
thing, this cycle of disappointment—to have lived it once as a bewildered child and 
then again as a rule-abiding adult. The faces change, the dates on the calendar 
advance, but the feeling remains as familiar as an old, worn book. 
Petitioner comes before this Court not with anger burning in his chest, nor 
with vindictiveness poisoning his pen, but rather with that quiet, heavy 
disappointment that settles in a person’s bones when they’ve done everything by

There comes a time in the journey of life when a man finds himself standing

courthouse steps, and feeling that same sinking sensation in his chest. It’s a peculiar
thing, this cycle of disappointment—to have lived it once as a bewildered child and

the book only to find the book itself has been shelved away, forgotten by those 
sworn to read from it.  
Petitioner followed the rules. He honored the procedures. He placed his faith 
in a system that promised justice would flow like water, clear and unobstructed, to 
those who seek it properly. He lived under the façade of facially void orders, and 
sustained extraordinary damages that were all caused intentionally by one person: 
the Respondent, who has sat in complete silence as this breakdown has continued 
to occur. 
Yet here stands Petitioner, a father twice removed—once from his home 
and once from his children—knocking on the courthouse door with papers properly 
filed, only to be told that the door shall remain closed because someone else might, 
at some future date, file papers at another door entirely. If this strikes the Court as 
a curious interpretation of justice, then we find ourselves in rare agreement. 
Mark Twain once observed that “the difference between the almost right word and 
the right word is really a large matter—it’s the difference between the lightning bug 
and the lightning.” In matters of law and children’s welfare, the difference between 
almost justice and actual justice is equally vast—it’s the difference between 
children thriving and children suffering, between a father’s presence and his 
absence, between following the law and merely gesturing toward it.  
The Petitioner is now in an extraordinary circumstance. On one hand, he

the book only to find the book itself has been shelved away, forgotten by those
sworn to read from it.

Petitioner followed the rules. He honored the procedures. He placed his faith
in a system that promised justice would flow like water, clear and unobstructed, to
those who seek it properly. He lived under the fagade of facially void orders, and
sustained extraordinary damages that were all caused intentionally by one person:
the Respondent, who has sat in complete silence as this breakdown has continued
to occur.

Yet here stands Petitioner, a father twice removed—once from his home

and once from his children—knocking on the courthouse door with papers properly
filed, only to be told that the door shall remain closed because someone else might,
at some future date, file papers at another door entirely. If this strikes the Court as
a curious interpretation of justice, then we find ourselves in rare agreement.
Mark Twain once observed that “the difference between the almost right word and
the right word is really a large matter—it’s the difference between the lightning bug
and the lightning.” In matters of law and children’s welfare, the difference between
almost justice and actual justice is equally vast—it’s the difference between
children thriving and children suffering, between a father’s presence and his
absence, between following the law and merely gesturing toward it.

The Petitioner is now in an extraordinary circumstance. On one hand, he

must seek mandamus relief respectfully compelling this Court to fulfill its

ministerial duty to hear and rule on Petitioner’s properly filed emergency TRO, 
which this Court refused to hear on March 28, 2025. The refusal came not from any 
defect in the filing itself, but solely from representations made by opposing counsel 
regarding a future filing in another court which she abandoned—a procedural 
sleight of hand that has left children in distress and a father without an adequate 
remedy for an appeal. 
On the other hand, the Petitioner must prohibit the 322nd District Court from 
setting a matter for a hearing that cannot bear a valid result through a concurrent 
Writ of Prohibition. The proper procedure wasn’t followed, and cannot be 
overlooked in the face of an emergency. 
 
In essence, a procedurally improper forward-looking consolidation motion 
to be filed in a different court was used to block a properly filed emergency TRO 
before this court. The court cannot rule on a case not before it, and mandamus is 
the proper remedy here if this court refuses to act. Given the extraordinary 
circumstances of this matter, and given there has been no response or opposition to 
the relief being requested, the court should grant the emergency TRO 
immediately through a written order delivered to all the parties via the 
electronic filing manager, set the matter for a hearing 14 days from the signing of 
the order, and require a written response from the opposing party no later than 7 
days prior to the hearing.

Despite the circumstances of this case, Petitioner feels that settlement will 
and could be a possibility in the future, but the priority remains to rebuild the status 
quo of the children that has been destroyed and regain the ability to provide for his 
children financially while damages are assessed and attended to. Petitioner is at the  
very least entitled to this immediate relief.  He is not asking this court for anything 
more than what it has the discretion to do and what the law demands that it must do 
given the circumstances. This intent to file mandamus is filed out of respect and 
serves as a notice to all parties of record of my position on this matter. 
Such absurdity should end with an order from this court in Petitioner’s 
favor, and in support thereof, he shows the following unopposed facts: 
II. STATEMENT OF FACTS 
1. On January 24, 2025, after more than 11 months of inaction, Petitioner 
filed a Motion to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution. The divorce case no 
substantive action from Respondent since April 2024, a legal ghost ship drifting 
without direction or purpose. That motion wasn’t attempted to be set for hearing 
until September of 2024, only after the Petitioner exhausted all efforts seeking 
relief throughout the Texas Judiciary without any participation from the opposing 
side. 
2. On March 19, 2025, driven by mounting concerns about the children’s 
welfare and learning that the 322nd District Court did not have continuous,

SAPCR in this Court (Cause No. 233-765358-25) seeking emergency relief for 
the children. The very next day, March 20, 2025, Ms. Carter suddenly reappeared 
like a character presumed missing in the second act, filing an answer to the 
SAPCR petition in this Court and thereby submitting to this Court’s jurisdiction 
by filing a response rather than a motion to abate. 
3. On March 21, 2025, Petitioner filed a verified Rule 12 motion 
challenging Ms. Carter’s authority to represent Respondent in this matter—the 
second such challenge, met with the same resounding silence as the first. 
4. On March 25, 2025, Petitioner filed an Objection to Consolidation and 
an Ex-Parte Emergency Motion for TRO. Two days later, on March 27, 2025, 
Petitioner contacted the court coordinator, requested a date and time to present the 
motion, and served the documents to the opposing party with the intent to present 
on March 28, 2025, at 9:00 A.M. before the Associate Judge of this Court. On that 
fateful morning of March 28, 2025, Petitioner drove to the courthouse, paid for 
parking, met with the coordinator, communicated with opposing counsel, and 
secured a hearing date of April 10, 2025. Petitioner then proceeded to the 
Associate Judge’s courtroom to present the TRO. 
5. Before Petitioner could present his case—before he could speak a single 
word about his children’s welfare—he was told that Ms. Carter would be filing a 
motion to consolidate in the 322nd District Court, that his motion was improperly 
before the court, and that the Associate Judge refused to hear the motion. It was a

curious thing, this refusal. Ms. Carter wasn’t even present in the courtroom, yet 
her words carried more weight than Petitioner’s physical presence, his properly 
filed papers, and most importantly, the urgent needs of his children. She stopped 
the proceedings with nothing more than word of mouth for the incorrect motion. 
A true showcasing of disregard for the process, and the children. 
6. On April 2, 2025, Petitioner filed a Pre-Objection to Motion to 
Consolidate in the 322nd District Court. Ms. Carter’s motion to consolidate wasn’t 
filed with the 322nd District Court until April 3, 2025—six days after she used its 
mere possibility to prevent this Court from hearing Petitioner’s emergency 
motion. Her motion disregarded Petitioner’s pre-objection entirely, as if it were 
invisible ink on the page. 
7. On April 4, 2025, unable to acquire a ruling due to Petitioner’s 
objection, Ms. Carter attempted to set the motion for a hearing before the 322nd 
District Court. That same day, Petitioner filed a Pre-Objection to Motion to 
Transfer in this Court, given that a motion to transfer must come before any 
attempt at consolidation. Ms. Carter, who had been so urgently concerned about 
consolidation when it served to block Petitioner’s emergency hearing, suddenly 
claimed to be unavailable until late April—causing significant delays that could 
have been avoided had this Court simply heard the motion before it on March 28, 
2025.

8. Throughout this period of procedural maneuvering, the children have 
been subjected to psychological manipulation and medical neglect. They have 
been removed from Petitioner’s care and placed with elderly great-grandparents 
on a daily basis, and are being gaslighted into a false belief that the divorce is 
finalized. Petitioner’s eldest child’s academic performance has plummeted, and 
both children have become emotionally estranged from both parents. Petitioner 
has suffered approximately $110,500 in verifiable financial damages due to being 
locked out of his home and business, and it grows each day. But the financial toll 
pales in comparison to the emotional cost of watching Petitioner’s children suffer 
while the courts exchange procedurally incorrect volleys over his head.  
III. ARGUMENT 
A. The Court's Ministerial Duty 
9. It is well-established Texas law that a trial court has a ministerial 
duty—not a discretionary duty—to consider and rule upon motions properly filed 
and pending before it. In re Sheppard, 193 S.W.3d 181, 183 (Tex. App.—Houston 
[1st Dist.] 2006, orig. proceeding); In re Chavez, 62 S.W.3d 225, 228 (Tex. 
App.—Amarillo 2001, orig. proceeding). The Texas Supreme Court has 
consistently held that while a court has discretion in how it rules on a motion, it 
has no discretion to refuse to rule at all. In re Blakeney, 254 S.W.3d 659, 661 
(Tex. App.—Texarkana 2008, orig. proceeding) ("When a motion is properly

duty—not a discretionary duty—to consider and rule upon motions properly filed
and pending before it. In re Sheppard, 193 S.W.3d 181, 183 (Tex. App.—Houston

consistently held that while a court has discretion in how it rules on a motion, it
has no discretion to refuse to rule at all. In re Blakeney, 254 S.W.3d 659, 661

motion is a ministerial act, and mandamus may issue to compel the trial judge to 
act."). 
10. This principle is not merely a procedural nicety but a fundamental 
cornerstone of our judicial system. When a court refuses to hear a properly filed 
motion, it effectively denies access to justice itself. As the Texas courts have 
repeatedly emphasized, "A trial court's refusal to rule on a pending motion within 
a reasonable amount of time constitutes a clear abuse of discretion." In re Bonds, 
57 S.W.3d 456, 457 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2001, orig. proceeding). This 
abuse is magnified exponentially when the motion concerns the welfare of 
children and seeks emergency relief. 
11. The Court's refusal to hear Petitioner's properly filed emergency TRO 
on March 28, 2025, constitutes a clear failure to perform a ministerial duty. This 
failure is particularly concerning given that: 
a) The motion was properly filed and noticed for hearing and the parties agreed 
on a date and time set for April 10th, 2025; 
b) Petitioner communicated with court staff, physically appeared at the 
courthouse ready to present the motion and was told he could present his 
motion; 
    c) The motion concerned the immediate welfare of children; and 
    d) The refusal was based solely on representations about a future filing in 
another court that had not yet occurred.

B. Clear Abuse of Discretion 
12. A writ of mandamus is appropriate when a trial court clearly abuses its 
discretion and there is no adequate remedy by appeal. In re Prudential Ins. Co. of 
Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 135-36 (Tex. 2004); Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 
840 (Tex. 1992). An abuse if discretion is clearly established from point one 
below, and supported by points two through eight: 
i. First, it refused to perform its ministerial duty to hear and 
rule on a properly filed motion based solely on representations 
about a future filing in another court. It’s as if a doctor refused to 
treat a bleeding patient because another doctor might, at some 
future date, claim the patient should be treated at a different 
hospital. 
ii. Second, it failed to recognize that by answering the 
SAPCR petition in this Court, Respondent submitted to this 
Court’s jurisdiction and should have instead filed a motion to abate 
or should have moved to transfer the case. The law doesn’t allow 
for half-measures of jurisdiction. 
iii. Third, it failed to recognize that this Court maintained 
jurisdiction until any transfer was completed pursuant to Texas 
Family Code § 155.005(d) as no final order has been rendered in 
the 322nd District Court. Jurisdiction isn’t a hot potato to be

dropped at the first mention of another court—it’s a solemn 
responsibility that remains until properly transferred.  
iv. Fourth, it failed to recognize that the proper procedure 
for consolidation of cases in different courts requires a motion to 
transfer to be filed and granted before any motion to consolidate 
can be considered, pursuant to Texas Family Code §§ 155.201 and 
6.407. The law provides a sequence, a proper order of operations, 
that cannot be reversed or circumvented without creating 
procedural delay, which is what the emergency TRO sought to 
prevent from occurring. 
v. Fifth, it allowed opposing counsel to circumvent proper 
legal procedure by influencing this Court’s decision without being 
present and without having filed any response to the emergency 
TRO properly before this Court. It’s as if the referee in a football 
game made a call based on what someone in the parking lot said 
might happen in the fourth quarter when she had the rules of the

vi. Sixth, it failed to consider that the purported “agreed”

shadow on the wall. No court has continuous, exclusive 
jurisdiction over the children in this matter. 
vii. Seventh, it failed to recognize that the Associate 
Judge’s orders in the divorce case were never properly adopted by 
the referring District Court as required by Texas Family Code § 
201.013(b). An unadopted order is like an unsigned check—it may 
look official, but it carries no legal weight, yet it has been used to 
bar the Petitioner from his residence, business, and children, and 
impose a disruptive and chaotic schedule upon the children. 
viii. Eighth, and perhaps most troublingly, it disregarded 
the children’s best interests in favor of procedural considerations, 
contrary to Texas Family Code § 153.002 and has languished for 
over a year due to the opposition’s failure to prosecute. 
 
12. The law is clear that in matters involving children, their welfare must 
be the court’s primary consideration—not procedural niceties, not docket 
management, and certainly not the convenience of opposing counsel. 
C. No Adequate Remedy by Appeal 
13. When Justice Delayed Is Justice Denied Petitioner has no adequate 
remedy by appeal for reasons that should stir the conscience of any court: The

jurisdiction over the children in this matter.

vii. Seventh, it failed to recognize that the Associate
Judge’s orders in the divorce case were never properly adopted by
the referring District Court as required by Texas Family Code §
201.013(b). An unadopted order is like an unsigned check—it may
look official, but it carries no legal weight, yet it has been used to
bar the Petitioner from his residence, business, and children, and
impose a disruptive and chaotic schedule upon the children.

viii. Eighth, and perhaps most troublingly, it disregarded
the children’s best interests in favor of procedural considerations,
contrary to Texas Family Code § 153.002 and has languished for

over a year due to the opposition’s failure to prosecute.

12. The law is clear that in matters involving children, their welfare must
be the court’s primary consideration—not procedural niceties, not docket
management, and certainly not the convenience of opposing counsel.

C. No Adequate Remedy by Appeal

13. When Justice Delayed Is Justice Denied Petitioner has no adequate

remedy by appeal for reasons that should stir the conscience of any court: The

emergency nature of the injunctive relief sought requires immediate action, as

Petitioner’s children are suffering immediate and ongoing harm while procedural 
issues remain unresolved. In re Texas Dep’t of Family & Protective Servs., 255 
S.W.3d 613, 615 (Tex. 2008) (granting emergency relief where children’s welfare 
was at immediate risk). Petitioner’s children are being alienated from him, 
causing long-term psychological damage that cannot be undone by a favorable 
ruling months or years in the future. In re Scheller, 325 S.W.3d 640, 643 (Tex. 
2010) (recognizing that interference with the parent-child relationship can 
constitute irreparable harm). 
14. The improper procedural maneuvers by opposing counsel are causing 
significant delays that cannot be remedied through the normal appellate process. 
Each day that passes is another day the children suffer, another day their academic 
performance declines, another day they become more emotionally estranged in a 
situation that the law should’ve prevented from existing to begin with. 
15. Temporary orders in family law cases are generally not appealable, 
leaving Petitioner in a procedural trap with no exit. Waiting for a final judgment 
to appeal would allow the improper procedural tactics to succeed, causing 
irreparable harm to Petitioner and his children. 
16. Void orders are being enforced against Petitioner, causing ongoing 
harm that cannot be adequately remedied by appeal. In re Sw. Bell Tel. Co., 35

D. Opposing Counsel’s Contradictory Behavior 
17. Cooper L. Carter’s contradictory behavior warrants particular 
attention, like a character in a novel whose actions never quite align with their 
words: She zealously defended her client by filing an answer to the SAPCR in this 
Court, thereby submitting to this Court’s jurisdiction, only to then influence this 
Court to refuse to hear Petitioner’s properly filed motion by representing that she 
would file a motion to consolidate in the 322nd Court, which would be moot by 
statute. 
18. She had abandoned the divorce case for nearly a year, filing nothing 
since April 24, 2024, only to suddenly reappear precisely when I sought 
emergency relief for the children—like a firefighter who ignores a smoldering 
house for months, only to rush in when someone else calls for help. She failed to 
respond to a Rule 12 motion challenging her authority to represent 
the Respondent, her silence speaking volumes about the nature of her 
representation. She subsequently filed an improper motion to consolidate in the 
322nd Court without first filing the required motion to transfer, putting the 
procedural cart before the horse. She is now claiming unavailability until late 
April in the 322nd Court, creating unnecessary delay after using the urgency of 
consolidation to block Petitioner’s emergency hearing.

19. This pattern demonstrates a tactical attempt to manipulate both courts’ 
dockets to prevent me from obtaining a timely hearing on Petitioner’s properly 
filed emergency motion. It’s a shell game played with the children’s welfare as 
the prize. This Court should not allow itself to be used as an instrument in such 
procedural gamesmanship, particularly when it involves a failure to perform a 
ministerial duty required by law and when children’s welfare is at stake. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
 
This Court’s refusal to hear Petitioner’s properly filed motion constitutes a 
failure to perform a ministerial duty for which there is no adequate remedy 
by appeal. The proper legal procedure requires a motion to transfer to be 
filed and granted before any motion to consolidate can be considered, and by 
answering the SAPCR petition in this Court, Respondent submitted to this 
Court’s jurisdiction. 
The children who are the subject of this proceeding are suffering 
immediate and ongoing harm while procedural issues remain unresolved. Each 
day that passes without addressing the emergency concerns raised in Petitioner’s 
TRO is a day of certain damage to the children’s psychological well-being and 
development. 
Petitioner once heard it said that the true measure of a society is found in 
how it treats its most vulnerable members. By that measure, the procedural

motion speaks volumes about how far we have strayed from the ideal of justice. 
The children— innocent, vulnerable, and deserving of the Court’s protection—
have instead become collateral damage in a game of procedural chess. 
Petitioner provides this petition not out of anger or vindictiveness, but out 
of that quiet, heavy disappointment that settles in a person’s bones when they’ve 
done everything by the book only to find the book itself has been shelved away. 
Petitioner followed the rules. He reiterates that he honored the procedures. He 
placed his faith in a system that promised justice would flow like water, clear and 
unobstructed, to those who seek it properly. 
Petitioner asks this Court to remember that behind every case number, 
behind every filing, behind every procedural rule, there are often real children 
with real lives that continue whether the courts act or not. Time doesn’t stop for 
them while adults sort out procedural disagreements. They grow, they hurt, they 
form memories and impressions that will shape them for a lifetime. 
As Mark Twain might have observed, the difference between justice 
served and justice delayed is the difference between a father’s presence and his 
absence, between children thriving and children suffering, between following the 
law and merely gesturing toward it.

TO THE HONORABLE COURT: 
 
Petitioner, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, PRE-OBJECTS to any motion to transfer filed  
on behalf of COOPER L. CARTER in this matter, and in support thereof, shows the following: 
I. INTRODUCTION 
1. On March 28, 2025, Petitioner set a properly filed motion to be heard in front of the 
associate Judge. 
2. Petitioner was denied an opportunity to be heard due to the claim that COOPER L.  
CARTER would be filing a motion to consolidate in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County  
as justification for the denial of due process. 
 
3. On April 2nd, 2025, Petitioner filed a PRE-OBJECTION laying out the legal reasons  
why COOPER L. CARTER’s consolidation motion was improper, and premature. 
 
4. COOPER L. CARTER cannot move to consolidate this matter with the divorce suit  
pending before the 322nd District Court because the Texas Family Code 6.407(b) explicitly  
states: 
“On the transfer of the proceedings, the court with jurisdiction of the suit for dissolution of a 
marriage shall consolidate the two causes of action.”

Petitioner,
PETITIONER’S PRE-OBJECTION TO
MOTION TO TRANSFER
MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS,

Respondent.

2025-04-04

TO THE HONORABLE COURT:
Petitioner, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, PRE-OBJECTS to any motion to transfer filed
on behalf of COOPER L. CARTER in this matter, and in support thereof, shows the following:
I. INTRODUCTION

1. On March 28, 2025, Petitioner set a properly filed motion to be heard in front of the
associate Judge.

2. Petitioner was denied an opportunity to be heard due to the claim that COOPER L.
CARTER would be filing a motion to consolidate in the 322™ District Court of Tarrant County
as justification for the denial of due process.

3. On April 2"¢, 2025, Petitioner filed a PRE-OBJECTION laying out the legal reasons
why COOPER L. CARTER’s consolidation motion was improper, and premature.

4. COOPER L. CARTER cannot move to consolidate this matter with the divorce suit
pending before the 322" District Court because the Texas Family Code 6.407(b) explicitly
States:

“On the transfer of the proceedings, the court with jurisdiction of the suit for dissolution of a
marriage shall consolidate the two causes of action.”

M.2085 M.2085

=== PAGE 315 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
 
5. Therefore, COOPER L. CARTER’s motion to consolidate is procedurally improper, and was  
used as a tool to interfere with emergency proceedings where no answer was provided. 
 
6. The court cannot refuse to hear a properly filed motion before it and give deference to an  
improperly filed motion notwithstanding COOPER L. CARTER’s misconduct and failure to prosecute the  
divorce suit. 
II. CONCLUSION 
 
7. For these reasons, Petitioner respectfully OBJECTS to any motion to transfer filed on behalf of  
COOPER L. CARTER. 
 
8. Furthermore, before any motion to transfer is to be set by COOPER L. CARTER, her authority  
pursuant to Rule 12 should be resolved by citing COOPER L. CARTER to appear and prove her authority  
to represent the Respondent in this matter.

5. Therefore, COOPER L. CARTER’s motion to consolidate is procedurally improper, and was
used as a tool to interfere with emergency proceedings where no answer was provided.
6. The court cannot refuse to hear a properly filed motion before it and give deference to an

improperly filed motion notwithstanding COOPER L. CARTER’s misconduct and failure to prosecute the

divorce suit.

Il. CONCLUSION

7. For these reasons, Petitioner respectfully OBJECTS to any motion to transfer filed on behalf of
COOPER L. CARTER.

8. Furthermore, before any motion to transfer is to be set by COOPER L. CARTER, her authority

pursuant to Rule 12 should be resolved by citing COOPER L. CARTER to appear and prove her authority

to represent the Respondent in this matter.

Respectfully submitted,

NO. 322-744263-23 
IN THE 322nd DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
TO THE HONORABLE COURT: 
Under Texas law, the doctrine of dominant jurisdiction dictates that when two suits 
involving the same parties and subject matter are filed in courts of concurrent jurisdiction, the 
court where the suit was first filed typically acquires exclusive control. However, this 
presumption can be overcome by showing that the first suit was initiated in bad faith or for the 
purpose of delay. Texas courts, following the rule established in Wyatt v. Shaw Plumbing Co., 
recognize exceptions where the first suit was filed merely to establish procedural priority, in 
anticipation of subsequent litigation, or to stall the opposing party’s legitimate claims. These 
principles provide a vital check against strategic abuse of court processes and ensure 
jurisdictional fairness when forum manipulation is evident. 
This analysis looks into the circumstances surrounding this matter, and is presented in a 
good-faith effort to provide insight to the court.

Dominant Jurisdiction Analysis with Bad Faith Focus 
I. Legal Framework for Dominant Jurisdiction 
A. General Principles 
Under Texas law, the doctrine of dominant jurisdiction provides that when two suits are 
pending in courts of concurrent jurisdiction involving the same parties and subject matter, the 
court in which the suit was first filed acquires dominant jurisdiction to the exclusion of the other 
court. This doctrine is established in the seminal case of Curtis v. Gibbs, 511 S.W.2d 263 (Tex. 
1974), where the Texas Supreme Court held that any subsequent suit involving the same parties 
and controversy must be dismissed if a party to that suit calls the second court's attention to the 
pendency of the prior suit. 
B. Bad Faith Exception 
However, Texas courts recognize an important exception to the dominant jurisdiction 
doctrine: when the first-filed suit was brought in bad faith or for the purpose of delay. As 
established in Wyatt v. Shaw Plumbing Co., 760 S.W.2d 245, 248 (Tex. 1988), the first court's 
dominant jurisdiction can be defeated by showing that the first suit was filed: 
1. As a mere pretext to establish priority; 
2. In anticipation of the second suit; 
3. For the purpose of delay; or 
4. In bad faith. 
When this exception applies, the second court may proceed with its case despite the pendency of 
the first-filed suit.

•
Initial divorce filing claimed an active protective order existed when none did

These misrepresentations were designed to prejudice the court against Charles
C. Procedural Manipulation
1. Strategic Delays and Attorney Changes
•
At the January 22, 2024 hearing, Morgan appeared without counsel
•
She hired Cooper L. Carter on the spot in the courtroom lobby to cause further
delay
•
This tactic successfully delayed the case until February 1, further prejudicing
Charles
2. Self-Help Tactics Outside Legal Process
•
On March 6, 2024, Morgan illegally locked Charles outside the home
•
This occurred after Charles had filed notice with the court that he would not leave
until after the hearing
•
This demonstrated willingness to circumvent legal process
3. Systematic Non-Prosecution
•
After securing favorable temporary orders, Morgan's counsel ceased prosecuting
the case

This pattern suggests the initial filing was not intended to resolve the dispute but
to secure tactical advantages
III. Application of Bad Faith Exception to Current Case
A. Legal Analysis
The facts of this case align precisely with the bad faith exception outlined in Wyatt v. Shaw 
Plumbing Co. The initial divorce filing shows clear evidence of being: 
1. A mere pretext to establish priority: The coordinated preparation of documents with
Dan Branthoover before any legitimate attempt at reconciliation or mediation
demonstrates the filing was pretextual.
2. Filed in anticipation of potential action by Charles: The timing of the filing after
Charles discovered evidence of an affair suggests anticipatory filing to gain tactical
advantage.
3. For the purpose of delay: The systematic non-prosecution of the case for nearly a year
after securing favorable temporary orders demonstrates the purpose was not resolution
but delay.
4. In bad faith: The numerous false statements in court filings, including claims about
protective orders, family violence, and financial status, constitute clear bad faith.

•
Court held that "filing a lawsuit for an improper purpose, such as to harass, cause
unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation, is sanctionable
conduct."
•
The pattern of behavior in the initial divorce filing aligns with this standard.
2. Perry v. Del Rio, 66 S.W.3d 239, 252 (Tex. 2001)
•
The Texas Supreme Court recognized that "the first-filed rule should not be
applied inflexibly or when doing so would reward gamesmanship or ill motive."
•
Morgan's coordinated preparation of divorce filings while misleading Charles
about her intentions constitutes precisely the kind of gamesmanship courts should
not reward.
3. Gonzalez v. Reliant Energy, Inc., 159 S.W.3d 615, 622 (Tex. 2005)
•
Court held that dominant jurisdiction does not apply when the first suit is filed "in
anticipation of the second suit and in an effort to subvert the second action."
•
The timing and coordination with Dan Branthoover suggest the divorce was filed
in anticipation of potential action by Charles after discovering the affair.
C. Family Law Context
In family law matters, courts have been particularly vigilant about bad faith filings due to their 
impact on children and families:

particularly vigilant about procedural gamesmanship that affects children's
welfare.
•
The false allegations of family violence and protective orders directly implicate
this concern.
2. In re Sims, 88 S.W.3d 297, 303-04 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2002, orig. proceeding)
•
Court held that in SAPCR cases, the best interest of the child can override strict
application of dominant jurisdiction.
•
The systematic non-prosecution of the case has prevented resolution, contrary to
the children's best interests.
IV. Implications for Current Proceedings
A. Legal Consequences of Bad Faith Finding
If the court determines the initial divorce filing was made in bad faith, several significant legal 
consequences follow: 
1. Dominant Jurisdiction Defeated: The 233rd District Court would not be bound by the
dominant jurisdiction of the 322nd District Court where the divorce was filed.
2. Consolidation Order Invalidated: The consolidation order would be invalid not only for
procedural defects but also because it erroneously applied dominant jurisdiction
principles to a bad faith filing.
3. Independent Proceeding Permitted: Charles's SAPCR filing in the 233rd District Court
could proceed independently, unaffected by the prior divorce filing.

4. Potential for Sanctions: The court could consider sanctions against Morgan and/or her
counsel for the bad faith filing and misrepresentations to the court.
B. Strategic Approach for Rehearing Motion
In the motion for rehearing, the bad faith analysis should be presented as an independent, 
alternative ground for mandamus relief: 
1. Primary Argument: The consolidation order should be vacated due to procedural defects
(lack of notice, hearing, proper transfer).
2. Alternative Argument: Even if procedurally proper, consolidation was improper
because the first-filed suit's dominant jurisdiction was defeated by bad faith.
3. Relief Requested: The court should:
•
Vacate the consolidation order
•
Recognize the 233rd District Court's authority to proceed independently with the
SAPCR
•
Order the trial court to hear Charles's emergency TRO on its merits
V. Conclusion
The doctrine of dominant jurisdiction is not an absolute rule but a principle of judicial 
efficiency that yields when its application would reward bad faith or procedural gamesmanship. 
The extensive evidence of coordination before filing, false statements in court documents, and 
systematic non-prosecution after securing favorable orders demonstrates that the initial divorce 
filing was made in bad faith.

4. Potential for Sanctions: The court could consider sanctions against Morgan and/or her

counsel for the bad faith filing and misrepresentations to the court.

B. Strategic Approach for Rehearing Motion

In the motion for rehearing, the bad faith analysis should be presented as an independent,

alternative ground for mandamus relief:

1. Primary Argument: The consolidation order should be vacated due to procedural defects

(lack of notice, hearing, proper transfer).

2. Alternative Argument: Even if procedurally proper, consolidation was improper

because the first-filed suit's dominant jurisdiction was defeated by bad faith.

3. Relief Requested: The court should:

e Vacate the consolidation order

e Recognize the 233rd District Court's authority to proceed independently with the

SAPCR

e Order the trial court to hear Charles's emergency TRO on its merits

Y. Conclusion

The doctrine of dominant jurisdiction is not an absolute rule but a principle of judicial
efficiency that yields when its application would reward bad faith or procedural gamesmanship.
The extensive evidence of coordination before filing, false statements in court documents, and
systematic non-prosecution after securing favorable orders demonstrates that the initial divorce

filing was made in bad faith.

Under Texas law, this bad faith defeats any claim of dominant jurisdiction by the 322nd District 
Court. Consequently, the consolidation order was not only procedurally defective but 
substantively erroneous in its application of dominant jurisdiction principles. The Court of 
Appeals should grant rehearing and issue mandamus relief to prevent the trial court from 
rewarding this bad faith through improper consolidation.

I. INTRODUCTION
Relator intends to invoke this Court’s original jurisdiction in three 
closely related mandamus proceedings arising from overlapping family law 
cases in Tarrant County. The three issues central to this dispute involve 
facially void temporary orders, the refusal to hear an emergency TRO, and 
the granting of the opposing party’s consolidation motion sua sponte in the 
face of an objection.  All three matters are legally and procedurally 
interdependent yet hinge on each-other to effectuate resolution. To provide 
context, the three mandamus matters are: 
1. No. 02-25-00164-CV (“TRO Mandamus”)
Issue Presented: Whether the 233rd District Court erred in refusing to 
adjudicate an emergency request for temporary relief in a SAPCR 
properly filed before it on March 28, 2025. 
Procedural Posture: Denied per curiam on April 11, 2025; rehearing 
Brief Posture: The TRO mandamus proceeding raises core legal issues 
concerning a trial court’s ministerial duty to rule on properly filed 
motions, the abuse of discretion in refusing to hear an emergency TRO 
based on a future, unfiled consolidation motion, and the denial of due 
process by refusing to rule on the matter before it. 
2. No. 02-25-00166-CV (“Void-Order Mandamus”)
Issue Presented: Whether temporary orders issued by the 322nd District 
Court on March 14, 2024, are void ab initio for want of consent. (MR 
17.1) 
Procedural Posture: Pending decision before this Court.

Brief Posture: Showcases a total breakdown of procedure between 
January 16th, 2024’s “kick-out” order (MR 6.1) and March 14th, 2024’s 
one-sided consent judgement. (MR. 17.38)

Mandamus”)
Issue Presented: Whether the sua sponte granting of Real Party’s 
consolidation motion without addressing the objection, notice, or holding

order on grounds that it was entered without notice, without hearing, and

rule 12 motion. 
II. BACKGROUND SUMMARY
Between December 14, 2023, and December 22, 2023, Real Party in 
Interest, Morgan Myers, attempted to get an emergency ex-parte order of 
protection from the court below (MR 2.7), initiated an eviction proceeding 
(MR 19.15), converted $1,576 of joint-marital assets to a family member on 
her way to receive help in preparing divorce paperwork (MR 19.14), initiated 
a protective order suit, (MR  19.15), and filed for divorce claiming that an 
active order of protection existed against the undersigned. (MR 2.7) 
This frenzy of frivolous lawsuits was designed to acquire an advantage 
in the divorce proceedings, which ultimately succeeded on January 16, 2024.

(MR 6.1). Spinning a narrative of the need for protection, Real Party leveraged 
this initial award to her advantage and was able to delay the proceedings 
further on January 22 by acquiring her legal representative three minutes prior 
to the hearing. (MR 7), eventually leading to settlement and a non-suit of her 
allegations (MR 8.3), which became the orders of the court on March 14, 
2024, and were rendered as an agreement without Mr. Myers’ consent. (MR. 
17.38) The remainder of the litigation amounted to a one-sided effort by the 
undersigned to seek relief while the opposing party sat in silence and 
abandoned their case. (MR 1) 
After eleven months of silence, the Real Party became active again 
only after the SAPCR was opened by Mr. Myers, who was prevented from 
presenting his emergency TRO at the 11th hour, resulting in no order, and 
the emergency still ongoing.
Shortly 
after 
the 
initial 
mandamus 
was 
filed on April 10, 
2025, the Honorable Kenneth Newell sua sponte consolidated the 
cases without notice by granting Real Party’s motion in the face of 
an objection, and without a hearing to discuss the pertinent issues. 
The undersigned is prepared to litigate these matters, and the necessity 
to stay these proceedings is essential to preserve the rights of the parties and 
prevent further irreparable harm from occurring in the interim.

III. NECESSITY FOR STAY
Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 52.10 Authorizes a Stay to 
Preserve the Status Quo. Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 52.10(b) 
empowers this Court to “stay the underlying proceedings pending mandamus 
review”. A stay is warranted here to “preserve important substantive and 
procedural rights from impairment or loss” which here, is exactly the 
situation calling for such a remedy.  
The procedural posture of this case combined by the lack of 
participation by the opposing side and lack of input from the courts below 
throughout presents a truly unique situation from a legal perspective.
IV. SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT
The 322nd and 233rd District Courts of Tarrant County, Texas, are 
locked in a jurisdictional impasse that must be resolved to protect the best 
interests of the children and restore procedural integrity. These matters can 
be concurrently resolved through stepwise legal analysis. The first and most 
critical question is whether the current temporary orders—issued as an 
agreed judgement without the consent of all parties—can stand (MR 17.1, 
MR 17.38).

If those orders are deemed void, then the 322nd District Court cannot 
assert continuing, exclusive jurisdiction (CEJ) under the Texas Family Code, 
which requires a valid final order to attach. see Tex. Fam. Code §155.001. In 
that event, the SAPCR filed in the 233rd District Court by the undersigned 
should stand as a procedurally proper original suit, and mandamus should 
issue to administer a hearing regarding the emergency TRO refused on 
March 28, 2025, without producing any valid order to challenge. 
At that juncture, should the Real Party argue dominant jurisdiction, the 
court must weigh the well-recognized exceptions under Texas law, including 
bad faith, unjustified delay, and strategic pretext—all of which are clearly 
demonstrated and conclusively established in the mandamus record filed 
concurrently with this matter. 
V. ARGUMENT
A. An agreed judgement rendered without consent is void
The first point of issue in this matter is the facially void orders rendered
on March 14, 2024. an order cannot expressly claim all parties consent “as 
evidenced by the signatures below” (MR 17.1) and then be absent from the 
document. (MR 17.38)

This is clear and cut Texas precedent. “A valid consent judgment cannot 
be rendered by a court when consent of one of the parties thereto is wanting. 
It is not sufficient to support the judgment that a party's consent thereto may 
at one time have been given; consent must exist at the very moment the court 
undertakes to make the agreement the judgment of the court.” Burnaman v. 
Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 (Tex. 1951) 
Here, the exact opposite occurred but our case takes it a step further. 
Mr. Myers was ordered to sign an agreement that he was in court that very 
same day to challenge. (MR 16.1) (“3. It is ordered that the parties shall 
present the temporary orders regarding the [associate judge’s report] signed 
on 02/01/2024 by 1:30 p.m. today.”)  
 
Moreover, the order explicitly refers to the Associate Judge’s Report 
signed on February 1, 2024, which could not have been possible because the 
attorney who was ordered to prepare the orders was no longer on the case. 
(MR 11) Therefore, the orders must be set aside, and mandamus should issue 
here. 
B. Continuous, exclusive jurisdiction 
Once the orders are declared void, we can then turn to the Texas Family 
Code § 155.001(a), which states “Specifically, except as otherwise provided

by this section, a court acquires continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the 
matters provided for by this title in connection with a child on the rendition of 
a final order.” Without the March 14 orders in place, which were a nullity from 
the start, the 322nd District Court does not retain continuous, exclusive 
jurisdiction as no other orders exist. Therefore, § 155.001(d) makes the 
SAPCR suit valid by statute, which leads us to an analysis of dominant 
jurisdiction. 
C. Doctrine of Dominant Jurisdiction
 Under Texas law, the doctrine of dominant jurisdiction provides that 
when two suits are pending in courts of concurrent jurisdiction involving the 
same parties and subject matter, the court in which the suit was first filed 
acquires dominant jurisdiction to the exclusion of the other court. This 
doctrine is established in the seminal case of Curtis v. Gibbs, 511 S.W.2d 263 
(Tex. 1974), where the Texas Supreme Court held that any subsequent suit 
involving the same parties and controversy must be dismissed if a party to that 
suit calls the second court's attention to the pendency of the prior suit. 
Normally, if the SAPCR matter were to try and set a matter for hearing, 
the Real Party could argue for dominant jurisdiction, as the divorce matter

was the “first filed” suit, and is pending before the 322nd District Court, and 
would have the suit transferred or abated. 
D. Bad Faith Exception
However, Texas courts recognize an important exception to the 
dominant jurisdiction doctrine: when the first-filed suit was brought in bad 
faith or for the purpose of delay. As established in Wyatt v. Shaw Plumbing 
Co., 760 S.W.2d 245, 248 (Tex. 1988), the first court's dominant jurisdiction 
can be defeated by showing that the first suit was filed:  
1. As a mere pretext to establish priority;
2. In anticipation of the second suit;
3. For the purpose of delay; or
4. In bad faith.
E. Three of four exceptions to dominant jurisdiction apply here
Here, three out of four of these exceptions apply. The suit was a mere 
pretext to establish priority, as Real Party went out of her way to file multiple 
frivolous lawsuits alleging family violence (MR 2.7, MR 3) only to then drop 
her claims after securing the children and home and abandon the case. (MR 
8.3)

The bad faith conducted by Real Party can be discerned by looking at 
the face of her pleadings themselves. On her original petition for divorce, on 
page 7, Real Party makes it known that she attempted to seek an emergency 
ex-parte order of protection on December 14, 2023. (MR 2.7) So the logical 
question to ask would be: why did Real Party need an emergency ex-parte 
order of protection if she already had an active order of protection? Better 
yet, why did mother seek a third protective order on December 22, 2023, if an 
active protective order was already in place? (MR 3) More importantly, why 
would she claim an active order of protection existed when she knew that 
wasn’t the case? (MR 2.7) This is a clear establishment of bad faith litigation, 
which also precluded her advantage by labeling the undersigned as an abuser 
prior to adjudication, satisfying two of four exceptions to dominant 
jurisdiction. 
Finally, after acquiring the children and home at the outset (MR. 6.1) 
and through the series of orders leading up to March 14, 2024, Real Party 
then abandoned her case and left the undersigned seeking relief throughout 
the Texas judiciary without opposition or participation. The only item found 
on the docket from the opposing side since then is a motion for pre-trial 
conference on April 24, 2024. (MR 1.7 DKT 206) In fact, it was only when

the undersigned opened the separate SAPCR that opposing counsel rushed in 
to defend it, leading to the concurrent mandamus filed under cause number 
No. 02-25-00164-CV currently at the rehearing stage. 
Therefore, because three of the four exceptions established in Wyatt 
apply here, the 322nd District Court of Tarrant county arguably would not 
retain dominant jurisdiction over the SAPCR suit filed by the undersigned to 
escape this procedural quagmire, and mandamus could issue there on 
rehearing so that they may lawfully proceed with the emergency TRO 
hearing which was turned away on March 28, 2025, which will lead to a 
situation that resembles what the legislature intends rather than the exact 
opposite. See Tex. Fam. Code 153.001. 
VI. Under the procedural posture of this case, a stay is not burdensome or
unduly prejudicial to the Real Party 
Given the unique and intertwined procedural posture of this matter, a 
stay is both appropriate and necessary to preserve the integrity of appellate 
review. Unlike Relator and the children—who continues to suffer irreparable 
harm under the force of void orders and were thrown into a chaotic 
arrangement —the Real Party in Interest faces no comparable prejudice from 
a stay. In fact, the Real Party has taken no meaningful action to prosecute their

compelled to file three concurrent mandamus petitions addressing three 
separate structural irregularities involving two district courts in a single-
family law matter. This unprecedented procedural posture is not the result of 
litigation excess, but rather a response to a cascading breakdown of 
jurisdiction, due process, and court administration, which independently 
threatens the ability of this Honorable Court to grant meaningful relief. 
In fact, the only litigation that has occurred in this case has come from 
the undersigned. This litigation is not fueled by vindictiveness nor spite, but 
rather from the necessity to restore the status quo so that this divorce may 
proceed. The Relator holds the upmost respect for all three Judges named in 
this suit, and it is his prerogative to aid in the case’s forward-looking

ARGUMENT 
A. Mandamus Standard
Mandamus relief is warranted when the trial court clearly abused its 
discretion, and the Relator (“Mr. Myers”), has no adequate appellate remedy. In re 
Coppola, 535 S.W.3d 506, 508 (Tex. 2017) (orig. proceeding) (per curiam). “A 
trial court clearly abuses its discretion if ‘it reaches a decision so arbitrary and 
unreasonable as to amount to a clear and prejudicial error of law' [or if it clearly 
fails] to analyze or apply the law correctly ․” Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 
839–40 (Tex. 2006) (orig. proceeding) (quoting Johnson v. Fourth Court of 
Appeals, 700 S.W.2d 916, 917 (Tex. 1985), disapproved of on other grounds by In 
re Columbia Med. Ctr. of Las Colinas, Subsidiary, L.P., 290 S.W.3d 204 (Tex. 
2009)). In any event, as shown in the next section, appeal is no remedy at all under 
these urgent circumstances. 
B. Consolidation and EX-Parte Procedure
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 174(a) permits consolidation of actions that 
involve common questions of law or fact. (APP 6.1) See also Lone Star Ford, Inc. v. 
McCormick, 838 S.W.2d 734, 737 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1992, writ 
denied). A trial court cannot arbitrarily consolidate cases in a manner that 
prejudices one of the parties. Even when consolidation is permissible in principle, 
the court must balance judicial convenience against any risk of unfair prejudice or

confusion, and it must respect the parties’ right to be heard on the issue. Crestway 
Care Ctr., Inc. v. Berchelmann, 945 S.W.2d 872, 874 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 
1997, orig. proceeding) (en banc). Consolidation decisions are reviewed for abuse 
of discretion, and “a trial court may abuse its discretion by … consolidating cases 
when the consolidation results in prejudice to the complaining party.” (citing Lone 
Star Ford, 838 S.W.2d at 738)  
In other words, when deciding whether to consolidate, the trial court must 
balance the judicial economy and convenience that may be gained by the 
consolidation against the risk of an unfair outcome because of prejudice. See Dal-
Briar, 833 S.W.2d at 615. Even if the cases share common questions of law and 
fact, an abuse of discretion may be found if the consolidation results in 
prejudice to the complaining party. Lone Star Ford, Inc., 838 S.W.2d at 738. 
Here, that is precisely what occurred. Mr. Myers has three concurrent 
mandamuses now before this court, and cause number 02-25-00164-CV, (“the 
TRO/SAPCR mandamus”) sought emergency relief in March 2025. (MR 8.2) The 
court’s procedural handling of his Application for Temporary Restraining Order 
(TRO) was highly irregular and violated the letter and spirit of Texas procedural 
rules.

without notice to the adverse party unless specific facts show immediate

irreparable injury will occur before notice can be given. Even when an ex parte 
TRO is justified, TRCP 680 requires the order to be narrowly time-limited (14 
days) and promptly set for hearing on a temporary injunction. (APP 7) Here, Mr. 
Myers followed the rules by giving notice to the opposing party and coordinating 
with the Court for a presentation of his TRO. (MR 12.1-12.9) Tarrant County Local 
Rule 4.01(11)(e) (likewise requires a party seeking ex parte relief to certify to the 
Court the efforts made to notify the opposing side or explain why notice should not

Notably, on March 27, 2025, the Court (through its coordinator) insisted that 
Mr. Myers appear in person to present the TRO and inform opposing counsel of the 
scheduled time. The coordinator wrote:  
“This order needs to be presented in person. Likewise, you need to inform opposing 
counsel of the date and time you intend to present this order to the court.” (MR 12.9) 
Mr. Myers promptly complied. He emailed Ms. Allison on March 27 
confirming that he had informed the opposing counsel of the intended presentation 
at 9:00 a.m. the following day and that he would update both the Court and 
opposing party if anything changed. (MR 12.9) 
After receiving no response from either the opposing counsel or real party in 
interest, Mr. Myers served the documents he intended to present to the court. (MR

in Parker County and is unable to attend. However, I will be available by cell phone regarding 
this matter if the Judge would like to speak to me regarding the Emergency TRO. Please 
contact our office to patch me in for any calls that Judge would like to have.” (MR 12.20) 
and most critically, the opposing counsel went on to say: 
“Additionally, this case already is pending in the 322nd for a divorce proceeding 
regarding property and children matters. We will be consolidating the case and walking it 
through the 322nd for signature next week.” (MR 12.20) 
The following morning, Mr. Myers made an appearance, as confirmed by the

“Mr. Myers appeared before me to schedule the hearing for the TRO; my apologies I did 
not realize this was that same case.  We can go ahead and set the TRO with us, but most

threshold matters should have came second to the best interests of the children. See 
Tex. Fam. Code 153.002. (APP 5) 
That statement – “I did not realize this was that same case” (MR 12.24)  – is a 
stunning acknowledgment of a procedural lapse. It indicates that the Court failed to 
connect the dots that Mr. Myers’ new case concerning the child was related to the 
ongoing divorce case. As a result, instead of promptly hearing Mr. Myers TRO on 
its merits, the Court stalled and immediately contemplated moving the case away, 
leaving Mr. Myers’ emergency request in limbo. The only individuals who 
followed proper procedure here were the undersigned and the court coordinator, 
non-licensed individuals. (MR 12.24)  
In summary, the procedure leading up to Respondent’s abuse of discretion 
was an abuse of discretion itself, warranting the “TRO/SAPCR Mandamus” that 
was denied per curiam without any substance. (APP 4) 
It was made very clear by the 233rd court that the consolidation motion filed 
by the opposing party on March 20, 2025, was filed in the incorrect court. (MR 5) 
(MR 12.17) This was used against Mr. Myers at the 11th hour to prevent the TRO 
hearing, as shown above. The forward-looking consolidation motion that was used 
to justify denying Mr. Myers his day in court was filed by RODERICK D. MARX, 
a non-party in either the SAPCR suit or the divorce matter on April 3, 2025. (MR 
13.5) see also (MR 7.18)

threshold matters should have came second to the best interests of the children. See
Tex. Fam. Code 153.002. (APP 5)

That statement — ‘‘/ did not realize this was that same case’’ (MR 12.24) —isa
stunning acknowledgment of a procedural lapse. It indicates that the Court failed to
connect the dots that Mr. Myers’ new case concerning the child was related to the
ongoing divorce case. As a result, instead of promptly hearing Mr. Myers TRO on
its merits, the Court stalled and immediately contemplated moving the case away,
leaving Mr. Myers’ emergency request in limbo. The only individuals who
followed proper procedure here were the undersigned and the court coordinator,
non-licensed individuals. (MR 12.24)

In summary, the procedure leading up to Respondent’s abuse of discretion
was an abuse of discretion itself, warranting the “TRO/SAPCR Mandamus” that
was denied per curiam without any substance. (APP 4)

It was made very clear by the 233" court that the consolidation motion filed
by the opposing party on March 20, 2025, was filed in the incorrect court. (MR 5)
(MR 12.17) This was used against Mr. Myers at the 11" hour to prevent the TRO
hearing, as shown above. The forward-looking consolidation motion that was used
to justify denying Mr. Myers his day in court was filed by RODERICK D. MARX,
a non-party in either the SAPCR suit or the divorce matter on April 3, 2025. (MR

13.5) see also (MR 7.18)

Shortly thereafter, the opposing counsel emailed Mr. Myers stating: 
“This is to inform you that I will be walking through the attached Motion for 
Consolidation and Proposed Order tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m. in the 322nd for 
signature.” (MR 12.31) 
Mr. Myers promptly replied, stating: 
“I've already objected. 
You have no legal authority to do so until you address my objection filed and 
served to you.” (MR 12.32) 
This procedural gamesmanship is the exact reason why the undersigned opened a 
new SAPCR, as it has left the divorce to languish outside of one-sided attempts to 
pursue relief, as clearly pointed out in his pleadings. There has been no meaningful 
discussion on the merits of this matter with the opposing side and no attempt to 
prosecute outside of the latest stunt to block emergency relief. (MR 1.1) From 
there, Mr. Myers filed a NOTICE OF INTENT TO SEEK MANDAMUS RELIEF 
in the 233rd (MR 14) and began preparing his first mandamus brief, which was 
submitted to this court on April 10, 2024. 
I. The Respondent clearly abused his discretion he sua sponte granted Real
Party’s contested consolidation motion without notice and hearing to the 
parties.

C. ABUSE OF DISCRETION
Immediately after submitting his first mandamus petition, Mr. Myers was 
served with an ORDER GRANTING CONSOLIDATION. (MR 15) This motion, 
which was used as a barrier to relief, was granted sua sponte by the same court 
who just declined to hear an emergency TRO before it. 
The record leaves no doubt that Respondent’s decision to consolidate the 
cases without notice or a hearing was a gross departure from the fair administration 
of justice. It is difficult to imagine a more textbook abuse of discretion: a contested 
motion was granted sua sponte, with no opportunity for the opposing party to be 
heard. This is not a close call or a minor procedural wrinkle. The facts speak for 
themselves – equity, due process, and basic procedural fairness were all denied in 
one fell swoop. The only question is whether they will continue to be ignored. 
Texas courts have held that a trial court clearly abuses its discretion by 
granting a contested motion sua sponte without providing notice or a hearing. In 
D.A. Buckner Constr., Inc. v. Hobson, for example, the trial judge entered an order
(imposing sanctions) even though the affected party had no notice or opportunity to 
be heard. The court of appeals declared that order void and emphatically stated: 
“Respondent’s order was without notice or hearing. Under these circumstances, the 
trial court’s order is void, and mandamus will lie to vacate such an order.” Such is 
the case here. Therefore, the law should apply equally.

D. NO ADEQUATE REMEDY 
In determining whether an appeal is an adequate remedy, courts have 
weighed the benefits over the detriments. In re BP Prods. N. Am., Inc., 244 S.W.3d 
840, 845 (Tex.2008) (orig.proceeding).  A party establishes that no adequate 
appellate remedy exists by showing it is in real danger of losing its substantial 
rights. Perry v. Del Rio, 66 S.W.3d 239, 257 (Tex.2001) (orig.proceeding). As 
repeatedly stated throughout these proceedings, Relator has been deprived of the 
most fundamental rights one can have: the right to possess and protect his home, 
and the right to care for, maintain contact with, and make decisions regarding his 
minor children. These rights are not abstract — they are protected by the U.S. 
Constitution, the Texas Constitution, and longstanding precedent. 
E. ONGOING AND IRREPARABLE HARM 
The Texas Supreme Court has repeatedly reaffirmed that “a parent’s rights to 
the care, custody, and control of their children are constitutional in nature and must 
be afforded heightened protection.” In re C.J.C., 603 S.W.3d 804, 809 (Tex. 2020). 
Likewise, property rights — including the right to remain in and possess one’s 
home — are protected under Article I, Section 19 of the Texas Constitution and the 
Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. See also University of Tex. Med. 
Branch v. Than, 901 S.W.2d 926, 930 (Tex. 1995)

When such rights are denied without valid order, hearing, or opportunity to 
be heard — as occurred here — the violation is not merely procedural: it is a 
constitutional injury, and one that warrants immediate mandamus relief. For all 
reasons incorporated herein, Mandamus should be issued, as deprivation is 
ongoing, and will occur until justice is rightfully served. 
Relator has clearly established the Respondent’s consolidation was both 
procedurally improper, and prejudicial. For all reasons incorporated herein, the 
court should uphold Texas precedent, and issue mandamus relief to restore justice 
to these proceedings. 
CONCLUSION 
With a prima facie showing of systemic abuse laid bare across the trilogy of 
mandamus petitions now before this Court, it is no longer credible to characterize 
the lower court’s conduct as isolated error. Two of the three heads of this 
procedural dragon—embodied by the 233rd, the 322nd, and this very Court—have 
already rendered per curiam denials, offering no explanation in the face of 
documented, unrebutted misconduct. The record in each petition stands 
unopposed. No adversary response has been filed. No evidentiary challenge has 
been made. The silence against Relator’s claims is not merely strategic—it is 
telling. A dangerous precedent is being forged in silence. This court must act.

PRAYER 
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Relator CHARLES DUSTIN 
MYERS respectfully prays that this Honorable Court: 
1. Issue a writ of mandamus compelling the Hon. Kenneth Newell, Judge of
the 233rd District Court, to vacate the April 2025 consolidation order, as it
was entered sua sponte on a contested motion;
2. Take judicial notice of the procedural irregularities and record-supported
adversity faced by Relator throughout these proceedings, including the
refusal to hear his emergency TRO while simultaneously granting relief to
the opposing party;
3. Grant all other relief to which Relator may be justly entitled, at law or in
equity, in light of the extraordinary circumstances and ongoing deprivation
of due process.
Relator has before this Court three petitions for writ of mandamus. Two have
already been denied per curiam without explanation—perhaps the result of routine 
disregard for pro se filings. But on rehearing, this Court is urged to evaluate this 
petition in conjunction with its sister mandamuses to fully grasp the depth of 
systemic abuse, procedural evasion, and judicial inconsistency present in the courts 
below.

ISSUES PRESENTED FOR RECONSIDERATION 
Rehearing Issue No. 1: 
According to the Texas Supreme Court, mandamus may issue to compel a 
judge to perform a ministerial act. The panel erred by overlooking that the 
trial court had a legal duty to act, that a demand for performance was made, 
and that the court refused to rule. 
Rehearing Issue No. 2: 
The panel erred by overlooking that the burden for mandamus was satisfied. 
The mandamus and supplemental records establish a prima facie showing 
that an emergency TRO was properly filed, a date and time to present the 
motion was secured, opposing counsel participated in scheduling the full 
hearing, and the trial court declined to proceed, resulting in no ruling or 
order.

TO THE HONORABLE SECOND COURT OF APPEALS: 
Relator CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS respectfully moves this Honorable 
Court for en banc reconsideration of the panel decisions rendered in three separate 
but interwoven mandamus proceedings to be presented for reconsideration in the 
following order: 
i. Cause No. 02-25-00166-CV (denied April 14, 2025) (“Void Order”)
ii. Cause No. 02-25-00171-CV (denied April 17, 2025) (“Consolidation”)
iii. Cause No. 02-25-00164-CV (denied April 11, 2025) (“SAPCR/TRO”)
This motion serves as the third filed reconsideration motion and addresses 
the panel’s denial of Cause No. 02-25-00164-CV (attached as Tab A), referred to as 
the “SAPCR” mandamus.  It is respectfully submitted that the panel’s per curiam 
dismissal overlooked substantial, uncontested factual inaccuracies and manifest 
procedural deficiencies meticulously substantiated within the mandamus and 
supplemental mandamus records. Such judicial oversight necessitates 
comprehensive en banc scrutiny to preserve jurisprudential coherence and fidelity 
to established precedents of Texas law. 
Relator welcomes a response from the Real Party or Respondent if such 
would provide meaningful insight into the situation.

STATEMENT OF FACTS 
On March 19, 2025, Relator filed a SAPCR as an original proceeding in the 
233rd District Court of Tarrant County which was subsequently answered by 
counsel for Real Party in Interest the following day. (MR 3).  An emergency TRO 
was later filed on March 24, 2025, in the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County. 
(MR 7, MR 7.26) The trial court was asked to perform a ministerial duty when a 
date and time was secured to present the motion. (SUPP 2.11, SUPP 2.24, SUPP 
2.26). The undersigned appeared on March 28, 2025, and it is undeniable that the 
full hearing was set for April 10, 2025, at 9:30a.m. The judge refused to hear the 
motion. Accordingly, no appealable order was issued.   
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT 
It is clear that the trial court below had a ministerial duty to act and refused 
to do so. When a trial court fails to rule on a motion that is properly filed and 
brought to its attention, the abuse of discretion is established as a matter of law. 
This aligns with longstanding mandamus jurisprudence, which requires only three 
elements to establish a clear abuse of discretion: the existence of a legal duty to 
act, a clear request for that action, and the court’s failure or refusal to do so. In re 
Shredder Co., L.L.C., 225 S.W.3d 676, 679 (Tex. App.- El Paso 2006, orig. 
proceeding); Stoner v. Massey, 586 S.W.2d 843, 846 (Tex. 1979).  All three 
elements are present here.

ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITY 
I.
Although disfavored in routine matters, en banc reconsideration is
appropriate where the legal standard is met, as it is here.
En banc reconsideration is reserved for the rare case that satisfies one or 
both of the “hard-to-satisfy requirements” set forth in Texas Rule of Appellate 
Procedure 41.2(c): ensuring uniformity in the court’s decisions or addressing 
extraordinary circumstances. The Texas Supreme Court has endorsed this narrow 
standard, cautioning against overuse to preserve judicial efficiency and ensure that 
“the appellate trains... run on time.” See In re Marriage of Harrison, 507 S.W.3d 
259, 260–61 (Tex. App.—[14th Dist.] 2016) (Frost, J., dissenting).  
Here, this is precisely the kind of novel case that warrants en banc 
reconsideration. The panel’s decision threatens a fundamental departure from 
settled Texas law—made more urgent by the fact that the emergency relief sought 
is on behalf of two minor children and remains unopposed by any party at the time 
of filing this motion. 
Further, the subject matter of this case—three concurrently pending 
mandamus proceedings, all arising from distinct but interconnected abuses of 
discretion—constitutes an extraordinary circumstance. Each petition was denied 
per curiam by the same panel despite a clearly established record of procedural 
violations and judicial inaction. The en banc court should examine and correct the

panel’s cursory denials to ensure that this Court’s precedent does not inadvertently 
endorse or perpetuate abuses of discretion that have been thoroughly documented 
across the mandamus and supplemental records without any opposition. 
II.
The panel’s per curiam denial conflicts with controlling authority and
overlooks critical facts established in the mandamus and
supplemental mandamus records.
"When a motion is properly filed and pending before the trial court, the act 
of giving consideration to and ruling upon that motion is a ministerial act, and 
mandamus may issue to compel the trial judge to act."  Safety-Kleen Corp. v. 
Garcia, 945 S.W.2d 268, 269 (Tex. App.- San Antonio 1997, orig. proceeding). 
However, the Relator must demonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion by 
failing or refusing to perform a ministerial act. 
A. The trial court abused its discretion by failing to rule on a properly filed
motion after being asked to act.
To establish an abuse of discretion, the Relator must show that the trial court 
received a properly filed motion, was made aware of it, and was asked to rule—
whether through direct correspondence or other documents drawing the court’s

panel’s cursory denials to ensure that this Court’s precedent does not inadvertently
endorse or perpetuate abuses of discretion that have been thoroughly documented
across the mandamus and supplemental records without any opposition.

II. The panel’s per curiam denial conflicts with controlling authority and
overlooks critical facts established in the mandamus and
supplemental mandamus records.

"When a motion is properly filed and pending before the trial court, the act
of giving consideration to and ruling upon that motion is a ministerial act, and
mandamus may issue to compel the trial judge to act." Safety-Kleen Corp. v.
Garcia, 945 S.W.2d 268, 269 (Tex. App.- San Antonio 1997, orig. proceeding).
However, the Relator must demonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion by

failing or refusing to perform a ministerial act.

A. The trial court abused its discretion by failing to rule on a properly filed
motion after being asked to act.

To establish an abuse of discretion, the Relator must show that the trial court
received a properly filed motion, was made aware of it, and was asked to rule—
whether through direct correspondence or other documents drawing the court’s
attention to the matter. See In re Villarreal, 96 S.W.3d 708, 710 (Tex. App.—
Amarillo 2003, orig. proceeding).

Here, the email correspondence between the court coordinator of the 233"
District Court, counsel for Real Party, and the undersigned found in SUPP 2.17-

2.22 clearly demonstrates that: 1) a motion was filed and properly before the court

without objection; 2) the undersigned appeared in person at a designated time and 
requested the court rule on his motion with a full trial setting secured for April 10, 
2025; 3) the court refused to rule on the motion.  
Therefore, the trial court clearly abused its discretion by refusing to perform 
a ministerial act after being properly asked to rule on a pending motion, which is 
well supported in the verified supplemental mandamus record. When a motion has 
been properly filed and brought to the attention of the trial court, the act of 
considering and ruling upon the motion is ministerial in nature, and mandamus 
may issue to compel the trial court to act.  See In re Layton, 257 S.W.3d 794, 795 
(Tex. App.— Amarillo 2008, orig. proceeding).  
B. By refusing to act, the Relator was left without an adequate remedy for an 
appeal. 
By refusing to rule, no order was issued. This left the undersigned without 
an adequate remedy by appeal and thus satisfies the standard for mandamus relief. 
See In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 135 (Tex. 2004). In other 
words, there is no adequate remedy at law for a trial court's failure to rule 
because "[f]undamental requirements of due process mandate an opportunity to be 
heard." See In re Christensen, 39 S.W.3d 250, 251 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2000, 
orig. proceeding). Here, those fundamental requirements were not satisfied, 
resulting in these proceedings.

CONCLUSION AND PRAYER 
Considering the facts incorporated herein, the en banc court should revisit 
the denial issued by the panel on April 11, 2025. (attached as Tab 1) It remains 
undisputed that an emergency motion was before the trial court (MR 7) the trial 
court was asked to rule on that motion, and the trial court refused to do so. 
The undersigned, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, therefore, respectfully 
prays that this Court grant en banc reconsideration, withdraw or vacate the panel’s 
per curiam denial, and remand this cause back to the 233rd District Court of Tarrant 
County for further proceedings consistent with law and justice. In doing so, the 
undersigned asks this Court to consider not only the record in this case, but the 
totality of the circumstances presented across all three pending en banc motions—
each evidencing distinct but interlocking abuses of discretion that have left him 
without an adequate appellate remedy. The Triplicate of per curiam denials should 
be reconsidered. Relator holds deep respect for the judiciary, the judges of this 
Court, and all parties involved, and trusts that neither his zealous advocacy nor his 
self-represented status detracts from the merits of the arguments presented.

ABSTRACT 
This research paper examines whether the Temporary Orders signed on 
March 14, 2024, in Cause No. 322-744263-23 (322nd District Court, Tarrant 
County) are facially void or legally invalid due to procedural irregularities. The 
analysis focuses on how the Associate Judge's Reports from February 1, 2024, 
and March 14, 2024, were processed, highlighting significant deviations from 
required legal procedures. The paper evaluates these irregularities against the 
framework of Texas Family Code provisions, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and 
relevant case law. Particular attention is given to issues of consent, due process 
violations, and the legal consequences of these procedural failures. The research 
concludes with an assessment of potential remedies, including mandamus relief 
and other direct attacks to vacate the orders.

A. Overview of the Case 
This report examines whether the Temporary Orders signed on March 26, 2024, 
in Cause No. 322-744263-23 (322nd District Court, Tarrant County) are facially void or 
legally invalid. Evidence indicates serious procedural irregularities in how the Associate 
Judge's Reports from February 1, 2024, and March 14, 2024, were handled. 
The case involves a family law matter between Morgan Myers (Petitioner) and 
Charles Myers (Respondent). The procedural history reveals a concerning pattern of 
deviations from standard legal practice and explicit judicial directives. Of particular 
concern are the following newly uncovered facts: 
The February 1, 2024, Associate Judge's Report required a typed Temporary 
Orders conforming to the report to be prepared by attorney Dan Bacalis within 20 days, 
approved by both attorneys within 5 days, and set for entry ("motion to sign") within 30 
days if no agreement.  
The order filed (March 26, 2024 Temporary Orders) was prepared well past the 
20-day/30-day deadlines – in fact about 44 days later – and by Cooper L. Carter 
(opposing counsel) instead of Dan Bacalis. It was not reviewed or approved by Charles's 
attorney (Bacalis had ceased representing Charles by then), and Charles was pressured to 
sign it immediately on March 26, 2024, under threat of adverse action, rather than being 
given the 5-day review period the Associate Judge had ordered and the parties actually 
had agreed to. 
The March 14, 2024, Associate Judge's Report contains handwritten directives 
written by opposing counsel, not the judge, including a coercive ultimatum that final 
orders must be presented by 1:30 PM that same day. The report notes that Charles 
objected to the form of the proposed order and refused to approve Paragraph 3 – 
evidencing that no true agreement on all terms existed.

This research paper addresses the following central question: Do these procedural 
failures – including non-compliance with the Associate Judge's instructions, lack of 
required signatures/approvals, and coerced "consent" – render the February 1 and March 
14 reports never properly converted into a valid court order, and thus make the March 26, 
2024, Temporary Orders facially void or otherwise invalid? 
The analysis will address the governing law (Texas Family Code provisions, 
Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and case law) and analyze potential due process 
violations. The paper will also discuss remedies, including whether mandamus relief or 
other direct attacks are appropriate to vacate the orders. 
II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
A. February 1, 2024 – Associate Judge's Hearing and Report 
On February 1, 2024, an Associate Judge never heard Petitioner Morgan Myers's 
motion for temporary orders. The purpose of the setting was for Petitioner to produce 
evidence of her family violence claims. According to the Associate Judge's Report for 
Temporary Orders signed that day, both parties appeared with counsel. The report recites 
that Petitioner (Morgan) and Respondent (Charles) "signed an Associate Judge's Report 
regarding Agreed Temporary Orders." In other words, the Associate Judge’s Report for 
Temporary Orders was represented as an agreed order. 
Notably, however, the February 1 report itself was not a final typed order; it was a 
handwritten form that Dan Bacalis, not the Associate Judge, completed. Crucially, at the 
end of the hearing the Associate Judge did not enter a final written order but instead set 
out a procedure to finalize one: 
1. A typed Temporary Order conforming to the Associate Judge's Report was to be 
prepared within 20 days of February 1, 2024. The report explicitly says: "A typed 
written Order conforming to this Report will follow within 20 days from the date 
this Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be prepared by [Dan Bacalis]."

Il. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
A. February 1, 2024 - Associate Judge's Hearing and Report

On February 1, 2024, an Associate Judge never heard Petitioner Morgan Myers's
motion for temporary orders. The purpose of the setting was for Petitioner to produce
evidence of her family violence claims. According to the Associate Judge's Report for
Temporary Orders signed that day, both parties appeared with counsel. The report recites
that Petitioner (Morgan) and Respondent (Charles) "signed an Associate Judge's Report
regarding Agreed Temporary Orders." In other words, the Associate Judge’s Report for

Temporary Orders was represented as an agreed order.

Notably, however, the February 1 report itself was not a final typed order; it was a
handwritten form that Dan Bacalis, not the Associate Judge, completed. Crucially, at the
end of the hearing the Associate Judge did not enter a final written order but instead set

out a procedure to finalize one:

1. Atyped Temporary Order conforming to the Associate Judge's Report was to be
prepared within 20 days of February 1, 2024. The report explicitly says: "A typed
written Order conforming to this Report will follow within 20 days from the date

this Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be prepared by [Dan Bacalis]."

2. Each attorney was to approve the order, with 5 days for review. The report states: 
"Each attorney should approve the Order. The parties do not need to approve the 
Order. The attorney reviewing the proposed Order shall have five (5) days to do 
so." Thus, both Morgan's and Charles's attorneys were required to sign off as to 
form; the parties' signatures on the final typed version were not strictly required 
by this instruction (since it says parties "do not need to approve"), but the initial 
report itself contemplated an agreed order and included signature lines for the 
parties as evidence of their agreement. In practice, for an agreed family order it is 
standard that both parties and counsel sign "Approved as to Form and 
Substance." 
3. If the attorneys could not agree on the form of order, a "Motion to Sign" hearing 
was to be set within 30 days of February 1. The report directs: "If an agreement is 
not reached, a Motion to Sign shall be filed and set within thirty (30) days from 
the signing of this Report." This meant by approximately March 2, 2024, any 
dispute about the order's wording or contents should be brought to the court for 
resolution. 
Finally, the February 1 Associate Judge's Report has an "AGREED AS TO FORM 
AND SUBSTANCE" signature block for the parties and attorneys.  
The Associate Judge did sign the report on February 1, making the report effective as 
an interim order of the court. Under Texas Family Code § 201.013, a signed Associate 
Judge's proposed order is in full force and effect pending any request for a de novo 
hearing by the referring court. No request for a de novo hearing was filed by either party 
within the 3-working-day window (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.015(a)). Therefore, the 
Associate Judge's rulings of February 1 became the governing temporary orders in effect 
– but only in the form of the handwritten report, pending entry of the formal typed order. 
B. March 14, 2024 – Attempt to Finalize Order and Second AJ's Report 
By early March 2024, no agreed typed order had been submitted or signed. Dan 
Bacalis (Charles's attorney) did not prepare the order within 20 days, nor was a Motion to

— but only in the form of the handwritten report, pending entry of the formal typed order.

By early March 2024, no agreed typed order had been submitted or signed. Dan

Bacalis (Charles's attorney) did not prepare the order within 20 days, nor was a Motion to

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Sign filed within 30 days. In fact, during this period Charles's counsel was terminated 
from representation just four days after the associate judge’s report was signed on 
February 1. To address the basis for any agreement being fraudulent, Charles promptly 
filed an emergency motion to reconsider evidence and vacate any agreement, which was 
eventually set for March 14 due to Cooper Carter’s availability. 
At the March 14 proceeding, instead of simply holding an entry hearing, the 
court and counsel engaged in off-the-record discussions to get the order finalized. 
Opposing counsel (Cooper Carter) took it upon herself to hand-write the directives on a 
new Associate Judge's Report form. These handwritten notes (penned by Carter, not the 
judge) included a coercive instruction that Charles must sign the final order by 1:30 PM 
that same day (March 14). 
Essentially, Charles was given an ultimatum to immediately acquiesce to the 
written order's terms. The March 14 report also documented that Charles objected to the 
form of the order and specifically did not approve Paragraph 3 (a provision in the draft 
order). In other words, as of March 14 there was not a full meeting of the minds – Charles 
had an unresolved objection to at least one substantive term. Despite this, the pressure 
was on to finalize the order that day, and the purpose of being there was for an entire 
different purpose.  
Importantly, the handwritten March 14 notes were not written by the judge and 
were not traditional judicial findings or rulings – they were more in the nature of 
instructions and a deadline apparently dictated by opposing counsel. There is no 
indication the Associate Judge held an evidentiary hearing on March 14 or made 
independent findings; instead, it appears the goal was simply to force execution of the 
previously "agreed" temporary order that had essentially been nullified by Dan Bacalis’ 
departure from the case. 
C. March 26, 2024 – Filing of the Temporary Orders and Circumstances of Signing 
On March 26, 2024, a typed "Temporary Orders" document was finally filed with the 
District Clerk. This document, which spans numerous pages, purports to memorialize the

temporary conservatorship, possession, and injunction terms that were discussed back on 
February 1. The key points about this March 26, 2024 Temporary Orders are: 
1. It was drafted by Cooper L. Carter, counsel for Morgan (as evidenced by the 
signature block indicating Carter's authorship and by the fact that Bacalis was no 
longer involved). This violated the Associate Judge's explicit instruction that Dan 
Bacalis would prepare the order. In effect, opposing counsel unilaterally drafted 
the order. 
2. It was prepared and filed well after the 20-day deadline set by the February 1 
report. Nearly two months had elapsed (far beyond the expected February 21 
deadline for drafting and March 2 deadline for a motion to sign). No extension or 
modification of the Associate Judge's timeline was on record. Thus, the order was 
untimely under the terms of the February 1 directive. 
3. Critically, the order was not reviewed or approved by Charles Myers's attorney. 
By the time the order was drafted in late March, Charles had no attorney of 
record (Bacalis did not sign the order and had withdrawn). The February 1 
report's procedure – requiring each attorney to approve within 5 days – became 
impossible to follow, since Charles had no counsel to review the draft. Carter did 
not seek approval from any attorney on Charles's side. In fact, the signature block 
shows Dan Bacalis's signature line blank (he did not sign off because he wasn't 
even on the case). 
4. The March 26 order was presented to Charles for his signature on extremely 
short notice (apparently on the same day). Charles did not sign the order. He was 
essentially confronted with the final order and told to sign immediately (recall the 
March 14 "1:30 PM deadline" threat) or face adverse consequences (the 
implication being the judge would sign it without his consent or possibly hold 
him in contempt or consider him uncooperative). Feeling coerced and with no 
counsel to advise him, Charles signed "Approved and Consented to as to Form 
and Substance" on March 26, 2024 – but this signature was not truly voluntary. It 
was done under protest to avoid an even worse outcome. It is telling that Charles

had explicitly refused to approve the same order's Paragraph 3 on March 14, yet 
by March 26 he capitulated and signed – a strong indicator of coercion rather 
than genuine agreement. 
5. The recitals in the March 26 Temporary Orders are misleading. The order opens 
by reciting that both parties appeared on February 1 and "signed an Associate 
Judge's Report regarding Agreed Temporary Orders", and that "The parties have 
agreed to the terms of this order as evidenced by the signatures below." While 
Morgan and her counsel indeed signed the report, Charles's signature was not on 
that report, so that recital is factually inaccurate. Thus, the very foundation – that 
the order is an agreed order – is incorrect. 
In summary, the March 26, 2024, Temporary Orders were entered following a 
process in which the Associate Judge's explicit procedures were not observed, one party's 
counsel was no longer involved to approve the order, and the other party's consent was 
effectively forced. 
III. LEGAL FRAMEWORK 
A. Authority of Associate Judges and Requirements for Temporary Orders 
Associate Judge's Orders and Reports (Texas Family Code Ch. 201) 
In Texas family law cases, an associate judge may hear temporary orders matters 
and issue a report or even render an order, but certain procedures apply. Under Tex. 
Family Code § 201.011, an associate judge's report must be in writing and in the form 
directed by the referring court. The associate judge can include a proposed order in the 
report. After the hearing, notice of the substance of the report must be given to the parties 
(which can be done in open court, as happened on February 1). 
Crucially, parties have a right to request a de novo hearing before the referring 
District Judge within a short window (generally 3 working days for temporary orders in 
SAPCR cases) after receiving notice of the associate judge's report. See Tex. Fam. Code § 
201.015(a). If no timely de novo hearing is requested, the associate judge's proposed

order may be adopted and enforced as an order of the district court. In fact, pending any 
de novo request, the associate judge's proposed order is in full effect as an order of the 
court (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.013(a)). This legal mechanism is intended to give 
immediate effect to temporary rulings, while allowing a quick review by the district judge 
if a party is dissatisfied. 
An associate judge has authority to "render and sign... a temporary order" in a 
SAPCR or divorce case. Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007(a)(14)(C) expressly so provides. The 
associate judge can also sign a final order if it is agreed in writing by all parties as to both 
form and substance. In other words, the statute recognizes that a true agreed order (with 
all parties signing off) can be signed by the associate judge and will carry the same 
weight as if the district judge signed it. For contested matters, typically the associate 
judge issues a report and proposed order for the district judge to sign, unless no party 
objects (in which case the associate judge's order often effectively becomes final after the 
de novo period). 
Requirements for Temporary Orders (Tex. Family Code § 105.001) 
Section 105.001 of the Family Code governs temporary orders in suits affecting 
the parent-child relationship. It broadly allows a court to make temporary orders for the 
safety and welfare of the child (e.g., conservatorship, support, restraining certain 
behavior, etc.). However, it also imposes certain procedural safeguards. For example, 
except in emergencies, temporary orders (like those appointing conservators or ordering 
support) can only be issued after notice and a hearing. 
Notably, a temporary order that excludes a parent from possession of or access to 
a child (as happened here, since Charles was forced out of the home and effectively had 
limited access) cannot be rendered without a verified pleading or affidavit showing the 
requisite facts (essentially a showing of immediate danger to the child). This is to ensure 
a parent is not denied access without due process and evidentiary support. In our case, the 
initial February 1 hearing was tied to a protective order application, so there likely were 
affidavits/pleadings on file – but whether evidence was presented is disputed. Regardless, 
the overarching principle is that due process must be afforded in temporary orders.

Requirements for Temporary Orders (Tex. Family Code § 105.001)

Section 105.001 of the Family Code governs temporary orders in suits affecting
the parent-child relationship. It broadly allows a court to make temporary orders for the
safety and welfare of the child (e.g., conservatorship, support, restraining certain
behavior, etc.). However, it also imposes certain procedural safeguards. For example,
except in emergencies, temporary orders (like those appointing conservators or ordering

support) can only be issued after notice and a hearing.

Notably, a temporary order that excludes a parent from possession of or access to
a child (as happened here, since Charles was forced out of the home and effectively had
limited access) cannot be rendered without a verified pleading or affidavit showing the
requisite facts (essentially a showing of immediate danger to the child). This is to ensure
a parent is not denied access without due process and evidentiary support. In our case, the
initial February 1 hearing was tied to a protective order application, so there likely were
affidavits/pleadings on file — but whether evidence was presented is disputed. Regardless,

the overarching principle is that due process must be afforded in temporary orders.

B. Agreed Orders and Rule 11 
Texas strongly favors parties resolving issues by agreement, but any agreement 
touching a pending lawsuit must satisfy Rule 11, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure to be 
enforceable. Rule 11 requires agreements to be either (1) in writing, signed by the parties 
or their attorneys, and filed with the court, or (2) made on the record in open court. An 
"Agreed Temporary Order" is essentially a Rule 11 agreement on the interim issues, 
incorporated into a court order. If one party does not actually consent or withdraws 
consent before the court renders the order, then there is no valid agreement to support an 
agreed order. 
Texas case law is clear that a court cannot render a valid agreed judgment or 
order without the genuine consent of both parties at the time of rendition. If a party 
revokes consent or never consented in the first place, the agreed judgment is improper. As 
the Texas Supreme Court has held in Burnaman v. Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288 (Tex. 1951), a 
judgment purporting to be a consent judgment, but actually rendered without consent, is 
void. Similarly, in S&A Restaurant Corp. v. Leal, 892 S.W.2d 855, 857 (Tex. 1995), the 
court confirmed that a party may revoke consent any time before judgment is rendered. 
C. Relevant Statutory Provisions and Case Law 
The legal analysis in this paper draws upon the following key statutory provisions 
and case law: 
• 
Texas Family Code § 201.007(a)(14)(C): Authorizes associate judges to render 
and sign temporary orders. 
• 
Texas Family Code § 201.011: Requirements for associate judge's reports. 
• 
Texas Family Code § 201.013: Effect of associate judge's report pending de 
novo hearing.

IV. ANALYSIS OF PROCEDURAL IRREGULARITIES 
A. Failure to Follow Associate Judge's Explicit Procedures 
The February 1, 2024 Associate Judge's Report established a clear procedure for 
finalizing the Temporary Orders. This procedure was not followed in several critical 
respects: 
1. Preparation by Wrong Attorney: The Associate Judge explicitly directed that 
Dan Bacalis (Charles's attorney) would prepare the typed order within 20 days. 
Instead, Cooper L. Carter (Morgan's attorney) prepared the order. This is a direct 
contravention of the court's instruction. The court's designation of a specific 
attorney to draft the order was not a mere suggestion but a directive. When a 
court specifies which attorney will draft an order, it is typically to ensure fairness 
and balance in the drafting process. By having opposing counsel draft the order 
instead, the court's intent was undermined, and the resulting document may 
reflect a bias toward Morgan's interests. 
2. Missed Deadlines: The Associate Judge set clear deadlines: 20 days for 
preparation of the typed order (approximately February 21, 2024) and 30 days for 
a Motion to Sign if agreement could not be reached (approximately March 2, 
2024). The final order was not prepared until March 26, 2024 – approximately 54 
days after the February 1 hearing. This delay of nearly two months exceeds both 
deadlines by a substantial margin. No extension of these deadlines appears in the 
record. The court's timeline was not merely advisory; it was a binding directive 
that established the parameters for finalizing the order. The failure to adhere to 
these deadlines constitutes a procedural irregularity that calls into question the 
validity of the resulting order.

3. No Attorney Approval: The Associate Judge directed that each attorney should 
approve the order, with a 5-day review period. By the time the order was 
prepared, Charles no longer had counsel of record. Dan Bacalis had withdrawn 
from representation and did not sign the final order. This means the order was 
never reviewed or approved by an attorney representing Charles's interests, as 
explicitly required by the Associate Judge. The requirement for attorney approval 
serves an important purpose: ensuring that the written order accurately reflects 
what was agreed or ordered at the hearing. Without this safeguard, there is no 
assurance that the final document faithfully represents the court's rulings or any 
agreement between the parties. 
4. No Motion to Sign Hearing: The Associate Judge directed that if agreement 
could not be reached on the form of the order, a Motion to Sign should be filed 
and set within 30 days. No such motion was filed, despite the fact that Charles 
objected to at least one provision (Paragraph 3) of the proposed order on March 
14, 2024. Instead of following this procedure for resolving disagreements, 
opposing counsel and the court apparently attempted to force Charles's 
acquiescence through coercive means. The Motion to Sign procedure is designed 
to provide a formal mechanism for resolving disputes about the form of an order. 
By bypassing this process, the court denied Charles the opportunity to present his 
objections in a proper procedural context. 
These procedural failures are not mere technicalities. They represent significant 
deviations from the court's own directives and from standard legal practice. The 
Associate Judge's instructions were designed to ensure a fair and orderly process for 
finalizing the Temporary Orders. By disregarding these instructions, the parties and the 
court undermined the integrity of the process and cast doubt on the validity of the 
resulting order.

The March 26, 2024 Temporary Orders purport to be an "Agreed" order, as 
evidenced by the recitals and the signature blocks. However, several factors indicate that 
there was no valid consent to support an agreed order: 
1. Missing Signatures
The March 26, 2024 Associate Judge's Report recites that both parties "signed an 
Associate Judge's Report regarding Agreed Temporary Orders" and that "The parties have 
agreed to the terms of this order as evidenced by the signatures below." However, Charles 
Myers's signature is notably absent from the report. This discrepancy between the recital 
and the actual signatures calls into question whether Charles ever agreed to the terms in 
the first place. 
The absence of Charles's signature on the report is particularly significant 
because the report itself states that the parties' agreement would be "evidenced by [their] 
signatures." Without Charles's signature, there is no evidence of his agreement as 
contemplated by the report itself. This creates a fundamental inconsistency: the document 
claims to be based on an agreement evidenced by signatures, yet one party's signature is 
missing. 
2. Objection Not Resolved
As of March 14, 2024, Charles explicitly objected to Paragraph 3 of the order and 
refused to approve it. This is documented in the March 14 Associate Judge's Report. This 
objection is clear evidence that Charles had not consented to all terms of the would-be 
agreed order. When a party voices an objection to the form or substance of a judgment 
before it is signed, the proper course is for the court to refrain from entering it as an 
agreed judgment. 
In family cases, either party can revoke consent to an agreement any time before 
the judge signs the order. Charles's conduct on March 14 amounted to either a non-
consent or revocation of any prior tentative consent regarding that disputed term. 
Therefore, at that point, the matter ceased to be fully agreed. Under Texas law, the judge 
could only proceed by either obtaining a new agreement or by treating it as a contested

matter. Forcing the party to sign under threat is not a valid option. If consent is 
withdrawn, the court cannot render an agreed order – doing so is an abuse of discretion 
and the order will be void because one party's consent was lacking at rendition. 
3. Coerced Signature = No Real Consent
Charles's signature on February 1 was obtained under duress. He was effectively 
given an ultimatum: sign immediately or face some unspecified but presumably severe 
consequence. Consent obtained through coercion, threats, or duress is not valid consent. 
In contract law, an agreement signed under duress can be voided. In judgment 
law, a party's forced assent is no assent at all – it is akin to no agreement. Here, Charles 
did not willingly approve the order's substance; he relented to pressure from his own 
counsel. This calls into question the voluntariness of the agreed order. Texas courts have 
noted that agreed judgments are essentially contracts approved by the court. Just as a 
contract signed under duress is voidable, an agreed judgment signed under duress should 
not be given effect. The integrity of the judicial process is undermined if one party is 
bullied into signing a judgment. 
4. Absent Attorney for Charles
Charles was pro se by March 14, without the benefit of counsel to advise him. 
This made him more vulnerable to coercion and means there was no attorney on his side 
agreeing to the order's terms. Morgan's attorney drafted it and of course agreed to it; 
Charles had no attorney to negotiate or ensure fairness. The disparity in representation 
and the rushed nature of the signing further indicate the "agreement" was one-sided. 
Essentially, the March 26 document was Morgan (through her attorney) agreeing with 
herself and getting Charles's signature as a formality. That is not a true meeting of minds. 
Under these circumstances, the March 26 Temporary Orders cannot be 
considered a valid agreed order. It was a unilateral order imposed on Charles with a 
veneer of consent. In Texas, when a judgment is recited as agreed but in fact one party 
did not consent, the remedy is typically to set it aside. For instance, in Samples 
Exterminators, the Texas Supreme Court held the agreed judgment void when one party's

consent was lacking. Likewise, in divorce cases, if one party withdraws consent to a 
mediated settlement, the trial court cannot enter it as a judgment (see Burnaman v. 
Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288 (Tex. 1951) – a decades-old case still often cited for the 
proposition that a judge has no authority to impose an agreement on a party who has 
repudiated it prior to judgment). Here, Charles's actions are tantamount to having never 
truly consented or having repudiated any earlier tentative consent. 
In sum, the final Temporary Orders are built on a false premise of party consent. 
On their face, they recite an agreement and show signatures, but the surrounding record 
shows Charles's signature and his attorney's signature is missing. This kind of 
discrepancy is something an appellate court or any reviewing court would look at with 
great concern. Facially, the order proclaims an agreement that did not actually exist – that 
is a strong indicator of invalidity. A judgment that misstates the existence of an agreement 
is at least voidable, if not void, because the court's authority to render that particular 
agreed judgment was never triggered by an actual agreement of the parties. 
C. Non-Conformance to the Court's Actual Rulings – Possible Substantive Variances 
Another question is whether the March 26 order fails to conform to what the 
Associate Judge ordered on February 1. If the final written order includes provisions that 
were never agreed to or never ruled on by the judge, it is improper. Charles's objection to 
Paragraph 3 suggests he believed that portion of the order was not agreed or not ordered 
on February 1. Indeed, reviewing the text of the Temporary Orders, Paragraph 3 (and 
related provisions) deals with the parents using the "AppClose" program for 
communication and sharing information. It is unclear if this specific requirement was 
discussed on February 1 or if it was an added term Carter inserted in the written draft. 
Often, such app requirements are agreed to by parties or ordered by judges to facilitate 
communication. If Charles objected, perhaps he felt it was beyond what was decided at 
the hearing. 
Furthermore, initially, the Feb 1 report gave Charles access to the family 
residence until March 1, 2024 and took the children out of their own home. On the March 
26 report, the dates suddenly shifted, actually creating a window where nobody would be

discrepancy is something an appellate court or any reviewing court would look at with
great concern. Facially, the order proclaims an agreement that did not actually exist — that
is a strong indicator of invalidity. A judgment that misstates the existence of an agreement
is at least voidable, if not void, because the court's authority to render that particular

agreed judgment was never triggered by an actual agreement of the parties.
C. Non-Conformance to the Court's Actual Rulings — Possible Substantive Variances

Another question is whether the March 26 order fails to conform to what the
Associate Judge ordered on February 1. If the final written order includes provisions that
were never agreed to or never ruled on by the judge, it is improper. Charles's objection to
Paragraph 3 suggests he believed that portion of the order was not agreed or not ordered
on February 1. Indeed, reviewing the text of the Temporary Orders, Paragraph 3 (and
related provisions) deals with the parents using the "AppClose" program for
communication and sharing information. It is unclear if this specific requirement was
discussed on February 1 or if it was an added term Carter inserted in the written draft.
Often, such app requirements are agreed to by parties or ordered by judges to facilitate
communication. If Charles objected, perhaps he felt it was beyond what was decided at

the hearing.

Furthermore, initially, the Feb 1 report gave Charles access to the family
residence until March 1, 2024 and took the children out of their own home. On the March

26 report, the dates suddenly shifted, actually creating a window where nobody would be

inside the home. Perhaps most egregious, is that on March 6th, 2024, prior to this hearing 
being held, Mother locked Father out of the family residence. 
Since the final order went beyond the scope of the February 1 hearing and 
imposed new obligations not covered in the AJ's oral pronouncement, the proper course 
would have been to litigate those terms (or at least for the judge to confirm both sides 
agreed). By unilaterally adding it and forcing Charles's signature, the order contains 
terms to which there was never a true assent or judicial determination. In Texas, a written 
judgment must conform to the court's oral rendition (or the parties' agreement). When it 
does not, that portion of the judgment is subject to being set aside or reformed. Here, we 
lack a transcript of February 1, but given Charles's resistance and the blatant differences 
in the two reports, there is no agreement. That means the final order, at least in part, does 
not reflect the actual "report" of the judge but rather what opposing counsel wanted, 
which is highly prejudicial. 
Additionally, because the final order was delayed, by March 26 the Associate 
Judge did not personally "render" those orders – he had made recommendations on 
February 1, but the actual signing on March 26 was by the Associate Judge. If the District 
Judge signed it believing it was agreed, when in fact it was not, then the District Judge 
was essentially misled. The district court has authority to enter temporary orders after an 
AJ's hearing, but if it's contested, the district court should know it's contested. Here, 
labeling it "Agreed" circumvented any further hearing by the district court. That 
implicates due process again – Charles never had a de novo hearing because it was never 
presented as a contested matter; the "agreed" label short-circuited his ability to get the 
referring court to hear his side. 
In conclusion on this point, the content of the March 26 order exceeds or deviates 
from what was legitimately agreed or ordered on the record, making those portions of the 
order unauthorized. An order that a court had no power to make (because the party didn't 
consent and no evidence was taken on that issue) is invalid. At the very least, it's an abuse 
of discretion to include terms not supported by the hearing. This is another reason the 
order is vulnerable to attack.

D. Due Process Violations and Equity 
Beyond the technical rule violations, the manner in which these temporary orders 
were obtained raises serious due process concerns: 
1. No Meaningful Opportunity to be Heard on Disputed Terms 
Charles was not afforded a real chance to argue against Paragraph 3 or any other 
disputed provision. The March 14 "hearing" was a farce in terms of due process – instead 
of an impartial judge considering his objection, he got an opposing counsel's ultimatum. 
The next step should have been a hearing before the district judge (since the AJ process 
had broken down into disagreement). By never allowing Charles a forum to voice why he 
objected (e.g., the changed dates, incorrect mailing address, etc.), the court denied him 
the basic hearing on that issue. Temporary orders, while expedited, still require that each 
party can present their case on any point of contention. This did not happen. 
 
2. Surprise and Lack of Notice 
The attempted final order was pushed through on March 26 without prior notice 
to Charles of an "entry" setting. Typically, when an order is to be entered, especially if the 
form isn't agreed, the party is entitled to notice when the judge will sign it and what 
version is being submitted. Here, Charles was ambushed with a sign-now scenario. That 
is arguably a violation of local rules or at least the spirit of Rule 305, Texas Rules of Civil 
Procedure, which contemplates notice to all parties of the presentation of a judgment for 
signing if not all parties have approved it. In Page v. Sherrill, the Texas Supreme Court 
voided a temporary custody change that was done ex parte without notice. While our case 
was not ex parte (Charles was physically present), the lack of formal notice and rushing is 
analogous to a notice failure. Due process requires notice reasonably calculated to inform 
the person of the action and an opportunity to respond. Charles's "opportunity" to respond 
was truncated to mere minutes under threat.

Having opposing counsel write the judge's orders (handwritten on the report) is 
irregular. It creates an appearance that the neutral arbiter (the judge) abdicated decision-
making to one side's lawyer. The result is not a product of a court's reasoned decision or 
mutual consent, but essentially the wish list of one party imposed as an order. Courts 
have inherent authority to sign orders, but they should draft or carefully review them – 
not just sign whatever one lawyer puts in front of them without the other's approval. If the 
March 14 report notes were indeed by Carter, the Associate Judge should not have relied 
on those as if they were the AJ's own findings. This informality undermines confidence 
that the order was the result of a fair process. 
 
4. Infringement on Parental Rights without Due Course 
The temporary orders severely restricted Charles's rights (requiring him to leave 
the marital home, giving Mother primary custody, supervising exchanges, etc.). Such 
significant deprivations, even temporarily, demand scrupulous adherence to procedure. 
By cutting procedural corners, the court potentially violated Charles's constitutional right 
to due process. The Texas Family Code's requirement of affidavits for excluding a parent 
(Fam. Code §105.001(c)) is one manifestation of due process protection. If those 
requirements were not strictly met or if the evidence was lacking (Charles alleges no 
evidence was presented on February 1 to justify kicking him out and giving mom full 
custody), that initial order itself was problematic. Compounding that with an improper 
finalization process makes it worse. Essentially, Charles and his children were subject to 
a significant custody determination without the full protections of a proper adversarial 
hearing or a proper agreed resolution – a hybrid worst-of-both: no hearing, and no 
genuine agreement. Such a result is fundamentally unfair. When taken into consideration 
that Charles needed the family home to operate his usual course of business, this makes 
even less sense and raises eyebrows as to how the mother was able to get away with such 
conduct. 
Equity and good conscience would call for such an order to be set aside. Courts

resulted from procedural irregularity. Here, the temporary orders process was tainted start 
to finish – from the lack of evidence at the outset (if Charles's earlier contentions are 
correct), to the failure to follow the AJ's procedures, to the coercion in obtaining 
signatures. There is a strong argument that Charles was denied due process, and thus the 
order is voidable on that independent basis. In some circumstances, a due process 
violation can render an order void (for example, an order issued without notice or 
jurisdiction is void). While Charles was present in the case (so jurisdiction over him 
existed), the manner of depriving him of rights without a fair hearing could be deemed 
void as a violation of constitutional due process. This is especially true if we analogize to 
cases where a court had jurisdiction but acted in a way that violated a party's 
constitutional rights – courts have not hesitated to grant mandamus or other relief in such 
scenarios because the usual deference to trial court discretion does not extend to ignoring 
fundamental rights. 
E. Are the March 26, 2024 Temporary Orders Facially Void? 
Considering all the above, we assess whether the final Temporary Orders can be 
deemed facially void (void on their face) or at least voidable and subject to being vacated. 
An order is "void" (as opposed to merely voidable) if the court that rendered it 
lacked jurisdiction or authority or if it violates a fundamental jurisdictional requirement. 
Typically, errors in following procedure make an order voidable (to be corrected on direct 
appeal or by motion), not outright void. However, Texas law provides that agreed 
judgments entered without consent are void because the court had "no power to render" 
an agreed judgment absent an actual agreement. In this case, the 322nd District Court had 
subject matter jurisdiction over the divorce/child case and personal jurisdiction over the 
parties, so jurisdiction in the traditional sense is not at issue. But did the court have 
authority to render the particular order it rendered? That is questionable, because the 
court believed it was entering an agreed temporary order – an act that is only authorized 
if all parties truly agreed. Since Charles's consent was not valid, the court's act of signing 
an agreed order was beyond its lawful authority (it could have held a contested hearing or 
sent it back to the AJ, but it could not force an agreement). Thus, one could argue the

=== PAGE 424 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
order is void ab initio for lack of the required consent. The face of the order proclaims 
that consent, but the supporting record contradicts it. 
When determining facial voidness, courts normally look at the judgment roll or 
the order itself and related documents. Here, the face of the order contains an internal 
inconsistency: it says both parties agreed and evidenced by signatures, but one attorney's 
signature is missing and we know one party's signature was coerced. Admittedly, 
coercion is an extrinsic fact (not evident solely from the document). However, the 
absence of Charles's attorney's approval is evident from the order itself – any reader can 
see one side's attorney did not sign. That is a facial defect in an "agreed" order. One could 
say the order is void on its face because it recites a non-existent agreement and because it 
was entered in violation of the statute that requires all parties' written agreement for an 
associate judge to sign a final order. (Although a temporary order doesn't require written 
agreement of all parties to be signed by an AJ, in this case the order explicitly relies on 
supposed agreement.) 
Even if a court hesitates to label it "void," it is unquestionably voidable for abuse 
of discretion and should be vacated on a direct attack. The trial court's failure to follow its 
own procedures and the statutory framework is a clear abuse of discretion. Few scenarios 
fit the definition of an abuse of discretion more squarely than a judge signing an order 
that one party's attorney never approved and that one party objected to and only signed 
under threat. The integrity of the order is so compromised that it cannot be allowed to 
stand. 
V. REMEDIES 
A. Vacating the Temporary Orders – Mandamus Relief 
Because these are temporary orders in a family law case, they are not appealable by 
ordinary means. Texas law is clear that temporary orders in family cases cannot be 
challenged by interlocutory appeal. See Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001(e) ("Temporary orders 
rendered under this section are not subject to interlocutory appeal."). Instead, the proper 
vehicle for challenging such orders is a petition for writ of mandamus. Mandamus is an

ordinary means. Texas law is clear that temporary orders in family cases cannot be
challenged by interlocutory appeal. See Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001(e) ("Temporary orders

M.2195

=== PAGE 425 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
extraordinary remedy that will issue only when (1) the trial court clearly abused its 
discretion and (2) there is no adequate remedy by appeal. 
In this case, both elements for mandamus relief are present: 
1. Clear Abuse of Discretion: As detailed above, the trial court clearly abused its 
discretion by: 
• 
Failing to follow the Associate Judge's explicit procedures for finalizing 
the order 
• 
Entering an "agreed" order without valid consent from both parties 
• 
Allowing procedural irregularities that violated due process 
• 
Permitting coercion to obtain a party's signature 
2. No Adequate Remedy by Appeal: Since temporary orders are not appealable, 
Charles has no adequate remedy by appeal. He would have to wait until a final 
decree is entered to challenge these orders on appeal, by which time the harm 
from the improper temporary orders would be irreparable. The children's living 
arrangements, Charles's access to them, and other important matters would be 
governed by invalid orders for months or even years while the case proceeds to 
final judgment. 
Texas courts have consistently granted mandamus relief in family law cases where 
temporary orders were entered improperly. For example, in In re Stearns, 202 S.W.3d 414 
(Tex. App.–Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, orig. proceeding), the court granted mandamus 
relief where the trial court's temporary orders effectively changed custody without proper 
notice or evidence. Similarly, in Page v. Sherrill, 415 S.W.2d 642 (Tex. 1967), the Texas 
Supreme Court granted mandamus relief where a temporary custody order was issued 
without notice and hearing, violating due process. 
If the order is truly void (as opposed to merely voidable), mandamus relief is even 
more appropriate. As the Texas Supreme Court held in In re Southwestern Bell Tel. Co.,

relief where the trial court's temporary orders effectively changed custody without proper

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
35 S.W.3d 602, 605 (Tex. 2000), if an order is void, mandamus relief is available without 
showing inadequate remedy by appeal. 
B. Alternative Remedies 
In addition to mandamus relief, Charles might consider the following alternative 
remedies: 
1. Motion to Vacate or Set Aside: Charles could file a motion in the trial court 
asking the judge to vacate or set aside the temporary orders based on the 
procedural irregularities and lack of valid consent. While this approach has the 
advantage of giving the trial court an opportunity to correct its own error, it may 
be less effective if the trial court is unwilling to acknowledge the problems with 
the order. 
2. Motion for Reconsideration or New Trial: Charles could file a motion for 
reconsideration or new trial on the temporary orders. This would allow him to 
present evidence of the procedural irregularities and coercion. However, there is 
no guarantee that the trial court would grant such a motion, and the time for filing 
may have already expired. 
3. Motion for Further Temporary Orders: Charles could file a motion for further 
temporary orders, essentially asking the court to revisit the custody and 
possession arrangements. This would not directly challenge the validity of the 
existing orders but could provide an opportunity to modify them. The 
disadvantage is that it would not address the underlying procedural problems. 
Of these alternatives, mandamus relief is likely the most appropriate and effective 
remedy given the nature of the procedural irregularities and the fact that temporary orders 
are not appealable. A petition for writ of mandamus would allow an appellate court to 
review the process by which the temporary orders were obtained and, if appropriate, to 
vacate them and direct the trial court to conduct proper proceedings.

In addition to mandamus relief, Charles might consider the following alternative

remedies:

1. Motion to Vacate or Set Aside: Charles could file a motion in the trial court
asking the judge to vacate or set aside the temporary orders based on the
procedural irregularities and lack of valid consent. While this approach has the
advantage of giving the trial court an opportunity to correct its own error, it may
be less effective if the trial court is unwilling to acknowledge the problems with

the order.

2. Motion for Reconsideration or New Trial: Charles could file a motion for
reconsideration or new trial on the temporary orders. This would allow him to
present evidence of the procedural irregularities and coercion. However, there is
no guarantee that the trial court would grant such a motion, and the time for filing

may have already expired.

3. Motion for Further Temporary Orders: Charles could file a motion for further
temporary orders, essentially asking the court to revisit the custody and
possession arrangements. This would not directly challenge the validity of the
existing orders but could provide an opportunity to modify them. The

disadvantage is that it would not address the underlying procedural problems.

Of these alternatives, mandamus relief is likely the most appropriate and effective
remedy given the nature of the procedural irregularities and the fact that temporary orders
are not appealable. A petition for writ of mandamus would allow an appellate court to
review the process by which the temporary orders were obtained and, if appropriate, to

vacate them and direct the trial court to conduct proper proceedings.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
The procedural irregularities surrounding the March 26, 2024 Temporary Orders in Cause 
No. 322-744263-23 raise serious questions about their validity. The evidence 
demonstrates multiple significant deviations from proper legal procedure, including: 
1. Failure to follow the Associate Judge's explicit instructions regarding who would 
prepare the order, the timeline for preparation, and the requirement for attorney 
approval; 
2. Lack of valid consent to support an "agreed" order, as evidenced by Charles's 
missing signature on the February 1 report, his explicit objection to Paragraph 3 
on March 14, the coerced nature of his signature on March 26, and the absence of 
his attorney's approval; 
3. Potential non-conformance between the final written order and what was actually 
ordered or agreed to at the February 1 hearing; 
4. Due process violations, including the denial of a meaningful opportunity to be 
heard on disputed terms, lack of proper notice, irregularities in the process, and 
significant infringement on parental rights without proper procedural safeguards. 
These procedural failures are not mere technicalities. They strike at the heart of the 
judicial process and the fundamental fairness that must characterize court proceedings. 
When a court order purports to be based on the agreement of the parties, but one party's 
consent was obtained through coercion or was never actually given, the integrity of the 
judicial system is compromised. 
The March 26, 2024 Temporary Orders are, at minimum, voidable due to the clear 
abuse of discretion in their entry. There is a strong argument that they are void on their 
face because they recite an agreement that did not exist and because the court lacked 
authority to enter an agreed order without genuine consent from both parties. 
Given the non-appealable nature of temporary orders in family cases, mandamus 
relief is the appropriate remedy. Charles should consider filing a petition for writ of 
mandamus asking the appellate court to vacate the temporary orders and direct the trial

court to conduct proper proceedings, either by holding a contested hearing on the 
temporary orders or by ensuring that any agreed order truly reflects the voluntary 
agreement of both parties. 
The procedural history of this case serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of 
adhering to proper legal procedures, especially in family law cases where the rights of 
parents and the welfare of children are at stake. Courts and attorneys must be vigilant in 
ensuring that agreed orders truly reflect agreement, that parties' due process rights are 
respected, and that the integrity of the judicial process is maintained.

ISSUES PRESENTED FOR RECONSIDERATION 
 
Rehearing Issue No. 1: 
The Texas Supreme Court has held that consolidation constitutes an abuse of 
discretion when it prejudices a party or misjudges the relatedness of actions. 
The panel erred by denying mandamus relief and allowing to stand a sua 
sponte consolidation order that prejudiced Relator by delaying urgent child 
custody proceedings, eliminating strategic advantages, pre-empted appellate 
review, generated further procedural confusion. 
 
 
Rehearing Issue No. 2: 
When the record demonstrates that separate proceedings are necessary to 
prevent manifest injustice, the trial court has a duty to avoid consolidation. 
The panel erred by overlooking the manifest injustice resulting from the trial 
court’s sua sponte consolidation, which violated due process by ignoring a 
pending Rule 12 motion and written objection, and introduced further 
procedural irregularities into already strained litigation.

TO THE HONORABLE SECOND COURT OF APPEALS: 
Relator CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS respectfully moves this Honorable 
Court for en banc reconsideration of the panel decisions rendered in three separate 
but interwoven mandamus proceedings to be presented for reconsideration in the 
following order: 
i. Cause No. 02-25-00166-CV (denied April 14, 2025) (“Void Order”) 
ii. Cause No. 02-25-00171-CV (denied April 17, 2025) (“Consolidation”) 
iii. Cause No. 02-25-00164-CV (denied April 11, 2025) (“SAPCR/TRO”) 
 
This motion serves as the second filed reconsideration motion and addresses 
the panel’s denial of Cause No. 02-25-00171-CV (attached as Tab 1), referred to as 
the “Consolidation” mandamus.   
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT  
This motion satisfies the stringent standards for en banc reconsideration 
under Tex. R. App. P. 41.2(c) because the panel’s denial conflicts with controlling 
precedent and overlooks critical facts in the mandamus record. The trial court 
abused its discretion by sua sponte consolidating Relator’s SAPCR with a stalled 
divorce case on April 11, 2025, without notice, hearing, or consideration of 
Relator’s objection and pending Rule 12 motion. This consolidation prejudiced 
Relator by delaying urgent child custody and support resolutions, eliminating 
strategic advantages, pre-empted appellate review, and caused further procedural 
confusion, violating Tex. R. Civ. P. 174(a) and Tex. Fam. Code § 153 .002. The

TO THE HONORABLE SECOND COURT OF APPEALS:

Relator CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS respectfully moves this Honorable
Court for en banc reconsideration of the panel decisions rendered in three separate
but interwoven mandamus proceedings to be presented for reconsideration in the
following order:

i. Cause No. 02-25-00166-CV (denied April 14, 2025) (“Void Order’)
ii. Cause No. 02-25-00171-CV (denied April 17, 2025) (“Consolidation”)
iii. Cause No. 02-25-00164-CV (denied April 11, 2025) (““SAPCR/TRO”)

This motion serves as the second filed reconsideration motion and addresses
the panel’s denial of Cause No. 02-25-00171-CV (attached as Tab 1), referred to as
the “Consolidation” mandamus.

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

This motion satisfies the stringent standards for en banc reconsideration
under Tex. R. App. P. 41.2(c) because the panel’s denial conflicts with controlling
precedent and overlooks critical facts in the mandamus record. The trial court
abused its discretion by sua sponte consolidating Relator’s SAPCR with a stalled
divorce case on April 11, 2025, without notice, hearing, or consideration of
Relator’s objection and pending Rule 12 motion. This consolidation prejudiced
Relator by delaying urgent child custody and support resolutions, eliminating
strategic advantages, pre-empted appellate review, and caused further procedural

confusion, violating Tex. R. Civ. P. 174(a) and Tex. Fam. Code § 153 .002. The

panel’s denial conflicts with Womack v. Berry, 291 S.W.2d 677 (Tex. 1956), Dal-
Briar Corp. v. Baskette, 833 S.W.2d 612 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1992), and Lone Star 
Ford, Inc. v. McCormick, 838 S.W.2d 734 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1992), 
which emphasize that consolidation must not prejudice a party. En banc review is 
essential to ensure uniformity in family law and protect the children’s best 
interests. 
ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITY 
I. 
En banc reconsideration is warranted under Rule 41.2(c) due to 
extraordinary circumstances and the need for uniformity. 
 
En banc reconsideration is appropriate when a panel’s decision conflicts 
with controlling authority or involves an issue of exceptional importance. Tex. R. 
App. P. 41.2(c); In re Marriage of Harrison, 507 S.W.3d 259, 260 (Tex. App.—
[14th Dist.] April 26, 2016, order) as corrected May 10, 2016 (Frost, J., dissenting 
to partial grant of en banc reconsideration). This matter meets both criteria. 
The panel’s per curiam denial on April 17, 2025, conflicts with Texas 
Supreme Court precedent requiring trial courts to exercise discretion within 
guiding rules and principles. Womack v. Berry, 291 S.W.2d 677, 683 (Tex. 1956) 
(mandamus appropriate to correct clear abuse of discretion in trial management). 
The consolidation delays critical child custody and support determinations, 
undermining Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002, which mandates that “the best interest of

the child shall always be the primary consideration of the court in determining the 
issues of conservatorship and possession of and access to the child”. Allowing trial 
courts to consolidate cases sua sponte without addressing objections or pending 
motions sets a dangerous precedent in family law, where procedural fairness is 
paramount. En banc review is necessary to maintain uniformity and protect the 
children’s welfare. 
II. 
The panel’s denial conflicts with controlling authority and overlooks 
critical facts established in the mandamus record. 
The panel’s denial fails to recognize the trial court’s abuse of discretion and 
the resulting prejudice, as evidenced by the mandamus record and established 
Texas law. 
A. The trial court abused its discretion by consolidating without sound legal 
basis. 
 
Tex. R. Civ. P. 174(a) permits consolidation only when cases share common 
questions of law or fact and when it does not prejudice any party. The trial court’s 
sua sponte consolidation of Relator’s SAPCR with an unprosecuted divorce case 
lacks a sound legal basis and contravenes this rule. In Dal-Briar Corp. v. Baskette, 
833 S.W.2d 612, 615 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1992, no writ), the court held that 
consolidation constitutes an abuse of discretion if it prejudices a party, such as by 
delaying urgent proceedings or creating procedural confusion. Here, the

consolidation delays time-sensitive child custody and support decisions, directly 
undermining Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002. For example, the SAPCR’s unresolved 
custody issues, critical to the children’s stability, are stalled by the divorce case’s 
procedural complexities, causing ongoing harm to their welfare.  
Furthermore, in Lone Star Ford, Inc. v. McCormick, 838 S.W.2d 734, 737 
(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1992, writ denied), the court affirmed that while 
trial courts have broad discretion to consolidate cases with common issues, such 
discretion is abused if consolidation results in prejudice to a party. In that case, the 
court found no abuse because the appellant failed to demonstrate prejudice, noting, 
“Appellant failed to demonstrate how it was prejudiced as a result of 
consolidation.” Id. at 738.  In contrast, here, the consolidation has caused 
significant prejudice by delaying urgent child custody and support resolutions, 
which are time-sensitive and critical to the children’s welfare under Tex. Fam. 
Code § 153.002. This delay distinguishes the present case from Lone Star Ford and 
underscores the trial court’s abuse of discretion, as the issues still remain 
unadjudicated. 
Moreover, Womack v. Berry, 291 S.W.2d at 683, establishes that mandamus 
relief is appropriate when a trial court abuses its discretion to a party’s detriment, 
such as through improper trial management. Although Womack addressed separate 
trials, its principle applies analogously to consolidation decisions that prejudice a

party. The trial court’s failure to demonstrate common questions justifying 
consolidation, coupled with its disregard for the prejudice caused by delay, 
constitutes a clear abuse of discretion. See also Guar. Fed. Sav. Bank v. Horseshoe 
Operating Co., 793 S.W.2d 652, 658 (Tex. 1990) (trial court discretion in 
consolidation is not unbounded). The panel’s denial overlooks these precedents, 
allowing an unsupported consolidation to stand. 
B. The sua sponte consolidation resulted in prejudice and violated due 
process. 
The trial court’s consolidation order, issued without notice or hearing, 
violated Relator’s due process rights by ignoring a pending Tex. R. Civ. P. 12 
motion challenging the Real Party’s counsel’s authority and Relator’s objection to 
consolidation. (MR 7, MR 9) In Crestway Care Center, Inc. v. Berchelmann, 945 
S.W.2d 872, 873 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1997, orig. proceeding), the court 
emphasized that significant procedural actions, like consolidation, require clarity 
and proper documentation to ensure fair review. Here, the trial court’s failure to 
provide notice or a hearing—despite Relator’s objection (MR 9.1, MR 12.32) and 
pending Rule 12 motion (MR 7)—created procedural irregularities.  Moreover, 
Tex. R. Civ. P. 12 requires an attorney to demonstrate authority when challenged, 
and the trial court’s failure to resolve this motion risks validating actions by 
potentially unauthorized counsel, creating a procedural quagmire.

This consolidation action prejudiced Relator in four critical ways: (1) 
delaying urgent child custody and support resolutions that remain unopposed, 
causing further harm to the children’s welfare; (2) eliminating strategic advantages 
in the SAPCR court; (3) causing procedural confusion by merging distinct legal 
issues; and (4) thwarted Relator’s attempt at seeking mandamus relief. These 
impacts mirror the prejudice in Dal-Briar Corp. v. Baskette, where consolidation 
harmed a party’s ability to pursue timely relief. The Real Party’s counsel’s failure 
to respond to this appeal further underscores the procedural irregularities. By 
upholding the trial court’s order, the panel’s denial conflicts with these authorities 
and fails to address the manifest injustice inflicted on Relator and the affected 
children. 
These impacts mirror the prejudice in Dal-Briar Corp. v. Baskette, where 
consolidation harmed a party’s ability to pursue timely relief, and contrast with 
Lone Star Ford, where no prejudice was found. The Real Party’s counsel’s non-

irregularities, as it leaves the Rule 12 challenge unaddressed. By upholding the 
trial court’s order, the panel’s denial conflicts with these authorities and fails to 
address the manifest injustice inflicted on the Relator and the affected children, 
who remain left without an adequate remedy for an appeal.

CONCLUSION AND PRAYER 
The trial court’s sua sponte consolidation order of April 11, 2025, is not 
merely erroneous—it is procedurally indefensible. By consolidating Relator’s 
SAPCR with a stalled divorce case without notice, hearing, or resolution of a 
pending Rule 12 motion and objection, the court flouted due process and Texas 
Family Code § 153.002’s mandate to prioritize children’s best interests. The 
pending Rule 12 motion challenged the Real Party’s counsel’s authority, yet the 
court and Real Party proceeded as if no question existed, risking the validity of 
every subsequent action. This illogic is akin to building a house on a contested 
foundation, inviting collapse.   
Relator prays that this Court grant en banc reconsideration, withdraw or 
otherwise vacate the panel’s denial, and issue mandamus relief compelling the 
Respondent to vacate the consolidation order. Such relief will restore procedural 
fairness, protect constitutional rights, and ensure the children’s best interests are 
not sacrificed to judicial expediency.
