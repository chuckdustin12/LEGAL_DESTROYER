Cooper,
Why are you here? You're just hurting my family and putting your client in an impossible situation. I'm not letting you win
this unless you're going to argue against my position. 
These boilerplate motions and other abnormalities are being carefully documented.
The temp. orders signed on March 14th were never adopted by the associate judge.
You didn't even file the right pleading to stop the SAPCR.. you should've abated the case but you instead submitted to the
court's jurisdiction by responding.
Then today, you requested a hearing when you never needed to, which opened me up to object on the record.
You claim you were hired in your individual capacity yet don't have any contact information on the State Bar and file thru
Marx Altman.
While your client was in court negotiating under false pretenses, she already was in a relationship with Damen
Kazlauskas, the guy I have 6,500 text messages from showcasing this was a giant setup from the start.
I mean, what gives? Do you need help? I don't mind working WITH YOU. I've never been against that. But I can't do that
unless our goals are aligned with the best interest of the children.
Can you not withdraw given the circumstances? 
Only reason I haven't filed a disqualification against you is because I don't want you to suffer any negative consequences
for this case because I feel you were dragged into it and weren't given the facts. 
Just trying to figure it out.
I mean, remember on the 14th when you handed me the documents that are currently a phantom haunting my children's
lives?
I could see it in your face. 
Just trying to be copasetic despite the immense challenges I've faced over the last year. Definitely don't wish anything
negative on you, or your client. Just have to do what's right. 
Hope you can respect that.
Always open to communicate if you ever need to.
I view life's challenges as a way to learn and experience new things - not run from them. We could all be learning together
here.
Respectfully,
Charlie Myers

Cooper,

Why are you here? You're just hurting my family and putting your client in an impossible situation. I'm not letting you win
this unless you're going to argue against my position.

These boilerplate motions and other abnormalities are being carefully documented.
The temp. orders signed on March 14th were never adopted by the associate judge.

You didn't even file the right pleading to stop the SAPCR.. you should've abated the case but you instead submitted to the

Then today, you requested a hearing when you never needed to, which opened me up to object on the record.
