Respondent, Relator, Defendant; representing himself in 
his own individual capacity as CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, hereby 
refrains from referring to himself in third person.  
 
I find it to be repugnant. In reality, I’m simply a 
father. A father who was brought into this situation during 
the most precious time of year.  Now, while I have the 
highest respect for the judiciary, this court, and all of 
its’ participants – today you have all left me scratching 
my head as to how after passing through two judges, a panel 
of three judges in the Second Court of Appeals followed by 
the entire court en banc, seven Justices at the highest 
level of the Texas judiciary, a regional presiding Judge, 
and a visiting retired Judge, in all of their collective 
experience, could not see the issues within this case. 
 
Perhaps most shocking is how after over 1,500 pages of

from our friends on the other side, it’s not enough to 
overcome the apparent, deep-seated antagonism that has only

I. INTRODUCTION

Respondent, Relator, Defendant; representing himself in

his own individual capacity as CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, hereby

refrains from referring to himself in third person.

I find it to be repugnant. In reality, I’m simply a
father. A father who was brought into this situation during
the most precious time of year. Now, while I have the
highest respect for the judiciary, this court, and all of
its’ participants - today you have all left me scratching
my head as to how after passing through two judges, a panel
of three judges in the Second Court of Appeals followed by
the entire court en banc, seven Justices at the highest
level of the Texas judiciary, a regional presiding Judge,

and a visiting retired Judge, in all of their collective

experience, could not see the issues within this case.

Perhaps most shocking is how after over 1,500 pages of
documents, pictures, Sworn statements, and most importantly
—- without any opposition or engagement with any part of it
from our friends on the other side, it’s not enough to
overcome the apparent, deep-seated antagonism that has only

left more questions unanswered and fraud unaddressed.

I am here not out of disrespect, but because I was 
compelled to be here. I am not seeking the world from this 
court, only answers. The relief I seek is not that of 
impossibility – but is that which is enshrined in the most 
fundamental protections our country has to offer. It’s a 
relief that has been continuously denied time and time 
again, without any explanation.  
In fact, the latest denial actually makes the most 
sense out of any order issued so far in this case, so for 
that I am hopeful. However, the latest denial, albeit 
legally justified on face value, was made in error, and the 
only exhibit attached to this motion is the reasons why I 
believe this to be true.

2. These efforts only came second to the rules of law. 
The inability to access the EFM at such a crucial juncture 
was communicated to the court and all parties relevant to 
the matter.  
3. Furthermore, the circumstances in this case have 
left me in a persistent state of planning for an inevitable 
appeal, such as here, where a denial as issued at the first 
opportunity and allows the court to escape any explanation 
for the important questions being asked of it.  
4. Given that my access to the EFM was unavailable 
during the crucial time that a sworn continuance should 
have been filed, it raises more questions which require 
answers to protect my rights that have been continuously 
violated. For example, given the circumstances, I can’t 
rely on the reason being a technicality regarding the EFM.  
B. THE DENIAL ONLY CREATES MORE UNADDRESSED ISSUES

which leads us here. I hope the court can respect that.

recusal or do what is right so that the recusal will be

IV. BASIS FOR REMOVAL 
14. Defendant, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, in the above-
captioned matter hereby provides notice of intent to remove 
this action to the United States District Court for the 
Northern District of Texas pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a) 
and § 1441(c)(1)(A). Removal is sought on the basis of 
substantial federal questions arising from alleged 
violations of Defendant’s due process rights, procedural 
negligence, and claims of unaddressed fraudulent actions by 
Plaintiff. Defendant submits the following in support of 
removal: 
A. Federal Question Jurisdiction Due to Violations of Due 
Process Rights 
15. This case raises significant federal questions 
under the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, 
specifically regarding Defendant’s right to due process. 
Defendant asserts that his due process rights have been 
repeatedly violated due to procedural negligence by the 
state court and the imposition of an agreement that was

state court has taken actions that have fundamentally 
deprived Defendant of a fair opportunity to present his 
case, as evidenced by the following: 
i. Plaintiff’s initial claims, including the 
unsubstantiated allegation of an active protective 
order, were not subjected to adequate evidentiary 
review or discovery. Instead, these claims were used to 
pressure Defendant into a settlement agreement that has 
since been revealed to be grounded in 
misrepresentation. The lack of judicial oversight in 
this process has effectively deprived Defendant of the 
ability to defend his rights and property, constituting 
a direct violation of due process. 
ii. The state court compelled Defendant to accept 
and sign a settlement agreement that Plaintiff obtained 
through alleged fraudulent representations. When 
Defendant contested the validity of this agreement, the 
court disregarded his objections and ordered him to

fraudulent claims, and procedural negligence that have

21. The Younger Abstention Doctrine generally bars 
federal intervention in active state proceedings. However, 
it does not apply here because Defendant is not attempting 
to disrupt the state court’s core jurisdiction over family 
law matters. Instead, Defendant seeks federal review due to 
ongoing procedural violations and unaddressed fraudulent 
actions by Plaintiff, which infringe upon Defendant’s 
federal rights. Federal oversight is necessary to ensure 
the protection of Defendant’s due process rights and to 
address the state court’s failure to enforce procedural

22. The ongoing procedural ambiguity and lack of 
resolution in the state proceedings justify removal beyond 
the standard 30-day window. The state court’s failure to 
scrutinize Plaintiff’s claims, enforce discovery, or 
provide clarifying documentation has created substantial 
ambiguity about the true basis for Plaintiff’s allegations 
and the validity of the coerced settlement agreement. This 
ambiguity effectively extends the removal window, as 
Defendant has not received adequate information to properly 
address these ambiguous and procedurally flawed claims. 
23. Plaintiff’s initial pleadings contain 
unsubstantiated claims impacting Defendant’s rights, and 
the state court’s failure to require discovery has

remains valid until clarification and compliance with

V. CONCLUSION AND PRAYER

In the instant case, the troubling reality of the
court’s initial decision will bear a lifetime of
consequence on the lives of the children it has left out of

the equation.

Given the significant procedural and factual issues in this
case, Respondent respectfully requests the Court adopt one
of the following remedies to ensure a fair and just

outcome:

1.Recuse Judges James Munford and Jeffrey Kaitcer from

further proceedings, or:

2. Alternatively, deny the recusal but with instructions 
that the Honorable James Munford: 
o Vacate the current temporary orders which are 
fraudulent; 
o Adopt the temporary orders and parenting plan 
submitted by Respondent, designed to prioritize 
the children's stability and continuity, and 
reflect what is in their best interests; 
o Order the parties to engage in mediation to 
facilitate a cooperative resolution focused on the 
children’s best interests and future plans for 
both parents, ensuring both parties’ livelihoods 
are maintained; 
o Require participation in family counseling to 
prioritize the children’s psychological well-being 
and assess the impact of the past 11 months; 
o Order that Petitioner complete the court-ordered 
Children in the Middle parenting class, or in the 
alternative, file a notice of completion, given 
the critical information provided in this program.

Granting either of these alternatives would allow the 
Court to rectify the underlying concerns of procedural 
fairness, ensuring that the children’s welfare and 
stability remain the focal points of all decisions. Such 
actions are essential to moving this case forward in the

Granting either of these alternatives would allow the
Court to rectify the underlying concerns of procedural
fairness, ensuring that the children’s welfare and
stability remain the focal points of all decisions. Such
actions are essential to moving this case forward in the

most efficient and just manner.

The issues in this case can be corrected just as

swiftly as they were created. It is here, at the threshold

Subject: RE: Today's hearing at 11 CL-12105
Dear Ms. Baker, and Mr. Carter,
I am writing to respectfully request a rescheduling of today’s recusal hearing due to an unexpected medical issue. Late
last night, I began experiencing severe tooth pain, which has now escalated to significant facial swelling and intense
discomfort. The pain is currently affecting my ability to speak, eat, and focus, making it challenging to fully participate in
today’s proceedings.
Specifically, it's my bottom left molar which the nerve is open and exposed causing significant pain. 
I want to sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, especially given the efforts the court has made to
accommodate this hearing. Please know that this request is made only out of necessity, and I deeply regret the timing as
I would prefer to move the case forward.
This request comes with a high degree of reluctance given the unexpected technical difficulties experienced last time and
would not be making it if it wasn't absolutely necessary.
Thank you all for your understanding and consideration. I am committed to continuing with the hearing at the earliest
possible opportunity as I am eager to move the case forward.
I wanted to inform the court as soon as possible out of respect for the courts busy schedule.
I currently am unable to locate the case on research texas, as I've been trying to file a formal notice but given the time I
wanted to ensure the court was made aware as soon as possible of the situation.
Lines of communication are open for further discussion or if any further information is needed.
With respect,
Charles Myers
