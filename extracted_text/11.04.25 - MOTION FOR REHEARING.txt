TO THE HONORABLE SECOND COURT OF APPEALS: 
 
Relator, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, respectfully moves this Court for 
rehearing in regard to the per curiam denial issued by this Honorable Court on 
October 31, 2025, and in support thereof, has attached a concurrent motion for 
leave to supplement  shows this Court the following: 
I. 
INTRODUCTION AND ISSUES FOR REHEARING 
1. 
Texas statutes and controlling case law make clear that a written order of 
referral is a mandatory, jurisdictional prerequisite for an associate judge to act in 
family law proceedings. Where, as here, the record facially shows that no such 
order was issued, all actions taken by the associate judge—including orders of 
withdrawal, consolidation, and temporary orders—are void and cannot be cured by 
party agreement, subsequent proceedings, or the passage of time. 
2. 
Rehearing is appropriate because the absence of a written order of referral 
constitutes a jurisdictional defect that renders the associate judge's actions void. 
The case docket, now properly authenticated and submitted with a concurrent 
Motion for Leave to Supplement the Record, conclusively demonstrates this 
jurisdictional defect. 
3. 
The issue on rehearing is the lack of the case docket to aid in the Court’s 
determination in the Relator’s original petition, which has now been provided, and 
facially supports his claims raised in his petition and can be verified by the Court.

II. JURISDICTIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND STATUTORY
FRAMEWORK 
4. 
Texas law is explicit regarding the authority of associate judges in family 
law proceedings. Under the Texas Family Code, a referring court must render 
either an individual or general order of referral when assigning a case to an 
associate judge. This requirement is not discretionary; it is a jurisdictional mandate. 
Specifically, Tex. Fam. Code § 201.006 provides that a judge "shall render" an 
order of referral—either for a specific case or a class of cases—before an associate 
judge may act. The use of "shall" in the statute imposes a duty, not a mere 
suggestion, and failure to comply deprives the associate judge of authority to act, 
resulting in a jurisdictional defect. 
5. 
Similarly, Tex. Gov't Code § 54A.007 requires that a judge must issue a 
written order of referral specifying the associate judge's duties before referring one 
or more cases. This written order is a mandatory prerequisite, and its absence 
means the associate judge lacks any authority to preside or issue orders. 
6. 
Texas courts have consistently held that when an associate judge acts 
without a proper order of referral, the resulting orders are void for lack of 
jurisdiction. A trial court has no discretion to misapply the law, and failure to 
comply with jurisdictional requirements constitutes an abuse of discretion

warranting mandamus relief. See Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 840 (Tex. 
1992) . 
III. EVIDENCE OF JURISDICTIONAL DEFECT
7. 
The docket for Cause No. 322-744263-23, submitted with Relator's Motion 
for Leave to Supplement the Record and properly authenticated by unsworn 
declaration pursuant to Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code § 132.001, 
conclusively demonstrates that no order of referral was filed before the associate 
judge began presiding over hearings and issuing orders. 
8. 
A review of the docket shows the absence of such an order, yet the 
mandamus record, as provided in the Petition for Mandamus, clearly shows the 
District Jude presided over the first order which removed the Relator from his 
home without findings (MR. B.1) and several subsequent orders were signed by 
the Associate Judge.  
9. 
These orders include an associate judge’s report signed January 22, 2024,
(MR C.1), an associate judge’s report signed February 1, 2024 (MR D.5), an 
agreed order of withdraw of counsel and consolidation (MR. E.2, MR. E.5), an 
associate judge’s report signed on March 14, 2024 (MR. H.1) and the temporary 
orders at issue. (MR. I.38) 
10. 
The first reference to any "Order of Referral" appears only on October 9, 
2024 (Docket Entries 228, 233, 234, 235) – approximately nine months after the

associate judge began acting in the case, and these entries actually pertain to 
recusal proceedings rather than the initial referral required by statute, highlighting 
the Relator’s efforts to seek an explanation for continued misapplication of Texas 
law that continues to occur in this case. 
11. 
In summary, the docket thus clearly shows that the associate judge acted 
without proper authority for months. This is not a mere technical defect but a 
fundamental jurisdictional error that cannot be waived or cured retroactively. 
12. 
The Respondent judge should be ordered to reject these orders as the 
referring Court, and the case should be remanded for further proceedings in 
accordance with Texas law. 
IV. MANDAMUS IS THE APPROPRIATE REMEDY
13. 
Mandamus is the appropriate remedy when a jurisdictional defect renders 
orders void and there is no adequate remedy by appeal. The ongoing enforcement 
of these void orders causes continuing harm to Relator and his children that cannot 
be remedied through the normal appellate process. 
14. 
The Texas Government Code authorizes this Court to issue writs of 
mandamus to enforce its jurisdiction and correct jurisdictional defects (Tex. Gov't. 
Code § 22.221). Because the orders at issue were issued by an Associate Judge 
without an order of referral, Relator has no adequate remedy by appeal, and 
mandamus relief is warranted.
