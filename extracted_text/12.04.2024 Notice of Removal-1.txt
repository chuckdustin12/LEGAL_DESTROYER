I. INTRODUCTION 
 
This case transcends traditional domestic relations disputes, presenting grave constitutional 
violations that necessitate federal intervention. Between December 14 and December 22, 2023, 
Plaintiff orchestrated a calculated series of legal actions in response to Defendant’s discovery of 
over 16,500 text messages between Plaintiff and two third parties—Damen Kazlauskas and Debbie 
Price—revealing a pattern detrimental to the marital relationship. These actions created an inherent 
procedural bias that deprived Defendant of his fundamental rights before any substantive 
adjudication by the State court. 
On January 16, 2024, Plaintiff’s actions culminated in Defendant’s removal from the 
marital residence and business, stripping him of his home, livelihood, and access to his children. 
These orders were issued without adherence to constitutional safeguards, evidentiary findings, or 
proper procedure. Despite the parties agreeing to a mutual continuance, this deprivation occurred 
simultaneously, a decision that the Plaintiff exploited in a later settlement agreement drafted by 
Defendant’s own legal representative who was terminated immediately thereafter. (DKT 48 & 22) 
Subsequent proceedings weaponized these unconstitutional orders, culminating in their 
unilateral reduction and entry despite Defendant’s objections at a hearing ostensibly convened to 
address his challenges. (DKT 78). What began as procedural violations has spiraled into a 
sustained deprivation of Defendant’s constitutional rights, effectively resolving all central issues 
of the divorce action without trial or meaningful opportunity to be heard. 
To date, all pleadings filed by Defendant remain unopposed, no final trial has been set, and 
Defendant’s exhaustive pursuit of relief through state remedies has yielded no results. This Court’s 
intervention is essential to restore procedural integrity and ensure Defendant’s fundamental rights 
under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment are restored.

I. INTRODUCTION

This case transcends traditional domestic relations disputes, presenting grave constitutional
violations that necessitate federal intervention. Between December 14 and December 22, 2023,
Plaintiff orchestrated a calculated series of legal actions in response to Defendant’s discovery of
over 16,500 text messages between Plaintiff and two third parties—Damen Kazlauskas and Debbie
Price—revealing a pattern detrimental to the marital relationship. These actions created an inherent
procedural bias that deprived Defendant of his fundamental rights before any substantive
adjudication by the State court.

On January 16, 2024, Plaintiff’s actions culminated in Defendant’s removal from the
marital residence and business, stripping him of his home, livelihood, and access to his children.
These orders were issued without adherence to constitutional safeguards, evidentiary findings, or
proper procedure. Despite the parties agreeing to a mutual continuance, this deprivation occurred

II. GROUNDS FOR REMOVAL 
The undersigned requests that the court assume jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 
28 U.S.C. § 1331 because this case raises substantial federal questions involving violations of the 
Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and Plaintiff’s actions, 
combined with the state court’s initial decision based on those actions, deprived Defendant of his 
home, business, and custody of his children at the outset of the litigation without the federally 
guaranteed protections of due process nor the evidentiary findings required by law at the 
conclusion of a show cause hearing brought under Title 4 of the Texas Family Code. (See Sec. 
85.001, Tex. Fam. Code, stating “[a]t the close of a hearing on an application for a protective 
order, the court shall find whether family violence has occurred.”).  
 
Here, no findings were entered, and that remains the case to date. The face of DKT. 19 
reveals where the Defendant was ordered to vacate his residency only after a continuance was 
extended to the parties by the court, to which they agreed. It’s important to note that this initial 
decision was made prior to the acquisition of legal representation by the parties and occurred on 
the only day in 2024 that the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County was publicly announced 
closed due to inclement weather. See https://www.facebook.com/p/Tarrant-County-District-
Courts-100092554647052/ 
This initial decision has proven to be procedurally fatal, as nearly 365 days after the case 
was filed, it remains unadjudicated, unprosecuted, and the case’s posture touches on several legal 
doctrines often used as a bar to federal subject matter jurisdiction that could be of wide interest 
to the federal courts and provide valuable insights and analysis into how protective orders are 
being utilized as weapons that undermine judicial integrity rather than provide for genuine 
protection to the party requesting it. Plaintiff’s

III. JURISDICTION 
 
This court should use its discretion and retain jurisdiction over this matter pursuant 
to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 for the extraordinary circumstances presented and which necessitate 
federal intervention to address grave constitutional violations under the 14th Amendment. 
Specifically: 
 
Although the Petitioner’s complaint doesn’t necessarily raise a federal question on 
its’ face, Defendant argues that her initial pleading was fatally and procedurally defective, 
which was directly responsible for the deprivation of his fundamental rights prior to 
adjudication. The petition falsely claimed an active protective order that should have, 
under Texas Family Code § 6.405(b), statutorily barred any hearing until the order was 
presented to the court. Notwithstanding the federal guarantee of due process and equal 
protection that were disregarded, the state courts also failed to abide by its own laws 
when it disregarded this safeguard.  
 
Moreover, the Defendant doesn’t ask this court to review a final state court 
decision, but rather dissolve a fundamentally and procedurally defective order which was 
secured by fraud and which was prosecuted by an attorney who is likely unauthorized to 
do so. 
 
Now, Defendant turns to address common jurisdictional bars to federal jurisdiction 
that are frequently used.

I. JURISDICTION

This court should use its discretion and retain jurisdiction over this matter pursuant
to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 for the extraordinary circumstances presented and which necessitate
federal intervention to address grave constitutional violations under the 14th Amendment.
Specifically:

Moreover, the Defendant doesn’t ask this court to review a final state court
decision, but rather dissolve a fundamentally and procedurally defective order which was
secured by fraud and which was prosecuted by an attorney who is likely unauthorized to
do so.

Now, Defendant turns to address common jurisdictional bars to federal jurisdiction
that are frequently used.

IV. THE YOUNGER ABSTENTION

In general, the Younger doctrine requires that federal courts decline to exercise

jurisdiction over lawsuits “when three conditions are met: (1) the federal proceeding would

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
interfere with an ‘ongoing state judicial proceeding'; (2) the state has an important interest in 
regulating the subject matter of the claim; and (3) the [defendant] has ‘an adequate opportunity 
in the state proceedings to raise constitutional challenges.'” Bice v. La. Pub. Def. Bd., 677 F.3d 
712, 716 (5th Cir. 2012) (quoting Middlesex Cnty. Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar Ass'n, 457 
U.S. 423, 432, (1982)). If these “three prerequisites are satisfied, then a federal court can assert 
jurisdiction only if ‘certain narrowly delimited exceptions to the abstention doctrine apply.'” Id. 
(quoting Tex. Ass'n of Bus. v. Earle, 388 F.3d 515, 519 (5th Cir. 2004)). In the present case, the 
third prong of the younger abstention doesn’t apply. Defendant has exhausted all state remedies, 
including administrative remedies, to no avail and without any explanation.  
 
Even if the Defendant did have an adequate forum to vindicate his rights in the State 
courts, the suit leading to the deprivation of his rights was brought in bad faith by Plaintiff, and if 
relief is not granted, the extraordinary circumstances of this case will cause further ‘irreparable 
loss [that] is both great and immediate.', as each day that these issues remain dormant adds to the 
irreparable loss caused by the Petitioner’s false claims and the State’s actions based on those 
claims. See Gates v. Strain, 885 F.3d 874, 880 (5th Cir. 2018) (quoting Younger v. Harris, 401 
U.S. 37, 45, 53-54 (1971)). 
V. THE ROOKER-FELDMAN DOCTRINE 
The Supreme Court has repeatedly noted that the Rooker-Feldman doctrine is a narrow 
jurisdictional bar. Lance v. Dennis, 546 U.S. 459, 464 (2006) (per curiam); Exxon Mobil 
Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., 544 U.S. at 283 (2005). The doctrine is designed to prevent 
lower federal courts from exercising jurisdiction over matters that are exclusively reserved for 
Supreme Court review under 28 U.S.C. § 1257. Lance, 546 U.S. at 463. Accordingly, this 5th 
Circuit has limited the application of Rooker-Feldman to those cases in which "a party suffered

interfere with an ‘ongoing state judicial proceeding’; (2) the state has an important interest in
regulating the subject matter of the claim; and (3) the [defendant] has ‘an adequate opportunity
in the state proceedings to raise constitutional challenges.’ Bice v. La. Pub. Def. Bd., 677 F.3d
712, 716 (Sth Cir. 2012) (quoting Middlesex Cnty. Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar Ass'n, 457
US. 423, 432, (1982)). If these “three prerequisites are satisfied, then a federal court can assert
jurisdiction only if ‘certain narrowly delimited exceptions to the abstention doctrine apply.” Jd.
(quoting Tex. Ass'n of Bus. v. Earle, 388 F.3d 515, 519 (Sth Cir. 2004)). In the present case, the
third prong of the younger abstention doesn’t apply. Defendant has exhausted all state remedies,
including administrative remedies, to no avail and without any explanation.

Even if the Defendant did have an adequate forum to vindicate his rights in the State
courts, the suit leading to the deprivation of his rights was brought in bad faith by Plaintiff, and if

U.S. 37, 45, 53-54 (1971)).

V. THE ROOKER-FELDMAN DOCTRINE

The Supreme Court has repeatedly noted that the Rooker-Feldman doctrine is a narrow
jurisdictional bar. Lance v. Dennis, 546 U.S. 459, 464 (2006) (per curiam); Exxon Mobil
Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., 544 U.S. at 283 (2005). The doctrine is designed to prevent
lower federal courts from exercising jurisdiction over matters that are exclusively reserved for
Supreme Court review under 28 U.S.C. § 1257. Lance, 546 U.S. at 463. Accordingly, this 5"

Circuit has limited the application of Rooker-Feldman to those cases in which "a party suffered

an adverse final judgment rendered by a state's court of last resort." Ill. Cent. R. Co. v. Guy, 682 
F.3d 381, 390 (5th Cir. 2012). Because the Defendant is not asking this court to review a final 
judgement rendered by a state court of last resort, the Rooker-Feldman doctrine should not bar 
federal jurisdiction over this removal.  
The orders in question were rendered as an agreement between the parties. To see the 
fraud upon the court, one needs to look no further than DKT 92, page 1, as it claims the parties 
agree to the terms of the order ‘as evidenced by the signatures below’, and that the parties 
‘appeared on February 1, 2024, to hear Petitioner’s motion for temporary orders’. However, 
when looking at the docket sheet, the only appearance made by the Plaintiff in this matter 
occurred on January 16th, 2024, when she was awarded on all issues and Defendant was deprived 
of those same issues prior to any adjudication taking place. This has left the Defendant seeking 
relief throughout the State system to no avail to the point where he has exhausted all state 
remedies to vindicate his constitutionally protected rights. 
VII. EXHAUSTION OF STATE REMEDIES 
 
From the outset of the case, Defendant has diligently been pursuing answers regarding 
the procedural posture of this case. How can both parties agree to a continuance, and only one of 
those parties be deprived of substantial interests without any findings being entered into the 
record? How can the Plaintiff file multiple frivolous lawsuits in an effort to damage Defendant, 
and when that effort comes to fruition, leverage the Defendant’s deprivation against him? When 
the basis for the settlement is challenged on reconsideration, how can the court refuse to re-visit 
the initial decision made in the case and order him to sign an agreement he doesn’t consent to? 
(DKT 78). These questions were presented to the second court of appeals and the Texas Supreme 
Court, who declined to take the case, necessitating this court’s oversight. The state’s failure to

when looking at the docket sheet, the only appearance made by the Plaintiff in this matter
occurred on January 16", 2024, when she was awarded on all issues and Defendant was deprived
of those same issues prior to any adjudication taking place. This has left the Defendant seeking
relief throughout the State system to no avail to the point where he has exhausted all state
remedies to vindicate his constitutionally protected rights.

VIL EXHAUSTION OF STATE REMEDIES

the procedural posture of this case. How can both parties agree to a continuance, and only one of

the initial decision made in the case and order him to sign an agreement he doesn’t consent to?
(DKT 78). These questions were presented to the second court of appeals and the Texas Supreme

Court, who declined to take the case, necessitating this court’s oversight. The state’s failure to

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
adjudicate this matter should be unacceptable in the eyes of the law especially given that the 
Plaintiff has raised no defenses against any claims brought forth against her, nor argued against 
any relief sought by the Defendant.  
VIII. UNAUTHORIZED PROSECUTION 
 
This case also presents a unique situation where the party initially deprived at the onset is 
the only party actively involved in the litigation. The docket consists wholly of un-opposed 
motions filed by Defendant, all of which remain unresponded to, including a partial summary 
judgement filed on February 26th, 2024, (DKT 68) and a request for discovery and admissions.  
 
Without any engagement from the opposing party throughout the entire appellate process, 
the only attempt to prosecute Plaintiff’s case has come in the form of a pre-trial conference 
motion filed on 04/24/2024 which was promptly objected to. (DKT 206, DKT 207). Neither the 
motion nor the objection to the motion have been addressed by the court. 
 
Furthermore, the Texas Office of the Attorney General attempted to intervene into the 
matter on June 28th, 2024, which was also promptly objected to by the Defendant. (DKT 216, 
DKT 217). Neither the intervention pleading nor the objection to the intervention pleading has 
been addressed by the court. The Texas OAG has since stopped pursuing relief and has not 
participated in any manner outside of their initial intervention pleading. 
 
In total, there have only been two motions filed in this case, but the ambiguity regarding 
who is representing the Plaintiff remains as the only two pleadings filed were “on behalf of 
Cooper Carter by Roderick Marx”. (DKT 21, DKT 206). 
 
Cooper L. Carter’s authorization is still in question and has been pending before the State 
since September 20th, 2024. (DKT 2220. Given that Ms. Carter prepared the current orders which 
reference a hearing that never occurred, and a motion never served on the Defendant, her

authority is directly relevant to the relief being sought by Defendant given that if her authority 
cannot be shown, Rule 12 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure dictates that the court prohibit 
counsel from appearing in the cause, and the court must strike the unauthorized pleadings if no 
person who is authorized to prosecute or defend appears.  
XI. TIMELINESS OF REMOVAL 
 
Although timeliness is procedural and not jurisdictional, the Defendant argues that 
removal is timely pursuant to 28 U.S. Code § 1446(b)(3). The “other paper” making the case 
removable is the docket sheet itself acquired by Defendant on 11/24/2024 showcasing that no 
transcript for the recusal hearing exists, which was denied on a technicality despite the parties 
agreeing to reschedule the case. (DKT 248, DKT 251) 
 
Defendant asserts that the Plaintiff’s attorney will not respond to this removal request. If 
she does so, it would be the first response in eleven months of litigation. 
X. CONCLUSION 
Defendant, Charles Dustin Myers, respectfully submits that this case exemplifies the type 
of extraordinary circumstances requiring federal intervention to prevent further irreparable harm 
and restore fundamental constitutional protections. The procedural irregularities, fraudulent 
misrepresentations, and deprivation of Defendant's core constitutional rights have rendered the 
state proceedings fundamentally unfair and incapable of ensuring justice. The state court's failure 
to address unopposed motions, correct procedural defects, and enforce its own laws has left 
Defendant with no adequate remedy at the state level.

protection under the law, and to restore procedural integrity to the underlying divorce action. By
