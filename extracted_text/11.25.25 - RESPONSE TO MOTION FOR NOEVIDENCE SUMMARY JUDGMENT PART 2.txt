PETITIONER’S RESPONSE TO RESPONDENT’S
MOTION FOR NO-EVIDENCE SUMMARY JUDGMENT

TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT:

COMES NOW, Petitioner, Morgan Myers, (hereinafter referred to as “Mother’) and files
this, her Response to Respondent’s Motion for No-Evidence Summary Judgment. Petitioner will
show unto this honorable Court that Respondent’s Motion for No-Evidence Summary Judgment
should be denied for the reasons stated herein:

I.
SUMMARY OF FACTS

On December 18, 2023, Mother filed her Original Petition for Divorce as a pro se litigant
in the above referenced cause number. At that time, she also filed an Application for a Protective
Order in cause number 322-744538-23. A Motion for Temporary Restraining Order, Temporary
Injunctions, and Temporary Orders was also filed by Petitioner on December 27, 2023 which was
set for January 15, 2024.

On January 2, 2024, Respondent (hereinafter referred to as “Movant Father’) filed a pro se

Original Answer and a subsequent Motion to Consolidate the divorce proceeding and the

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Protective Order proceeding, which was later granted. An Original Counterpetition was filed by 
Movant Father on January 16, 2024.  
The parties appeared for a hearing on January 16, 2024 and the case was reset by Judge 
Mumford for January 22, 2024. In the interim, Judge Mumford ordered that Movant Father was to 
vacate the marital home until the hearing date.  
On January 23, 2024, a request for continuance to hear the Temporary Orders and 
Application for Protective Order was granted.  
On January 31, 2024, Mother obtained counsel Cooper L. Carter who filed a First Amended 
Petition for Divorce and Movant Father filed a First Amended Counterpetition for Divorce via 
Daniel R. Bacalis, his hired counsel.  
On February 1, 2024, the parties attended a hearing for Temporary Orders and Application 
for Protective Order. At the hearing, both parties had legal representation and were able to come 
to an agreement as evidenced by the Agreed Associate Judge’s Report for Temporary Orders that 
was signed by all parties, attorneys, and the Court. Additionally, Temporary Orders were drafted 
in this proceeding based on the Agreed Associate Judge’s Report for Temporary Orders and were 
signed by the Court. These Temporary Orders contained orders regarding conservatorship, 
possession and access, child support, medical support, and temporary division of property and 
debt, as well as mutual injunctions. Thereafter, Movant Father terminated Mr. Bacalis as his 
attorney of record and began to represent himself throughout the rest of the litigation proceeding.  
On March 14, 2024, the Court heard Movant Father’s Motion to Vacate Temporary Orders 
and the request was denied by the Court.  
On April 24, 2024, Mtoher’s counsel filed a Motion for Pretrial Conference so as to move 
the case forward and request a Final Trial date. An objection to this motion was filed by pro se

Movant Father on the same day.  
On June 28, 2024, The Office of the Attorney General filed an Intervention into this case 
and on July 1, 2024, Movant Father filed an objection to their intervention.  
Thereafter, this case history becomes extensive. Movant Father has filed numerous motions

claims, Motions for Recusal, Motions in Limine, Notices of Intent to Remove the proceeding to 
federal court, Motion for Dismiss for Want of Prosecution, Motions to Dismiss for Lack of 
Jurisdiction, etc.  
Now, Movant Father has filed a Motion for No-Evidence Summary Judgment and has set 
it for a hearing on December 2, 2025 under the incorrect presumption that there is no evidence of 
Mother’s claims in her Second Amended Petition for Divorce. Movant Father’s requested relief in 
his Motion for No-Evidence Summary Judgment should be denied in its totality.   
II. 
SUMMARY JUDGEMENT EVIDENCE 
 
Movant Father’s Motion should be denied because the entirety of his Motion is not 
competent summary judgment evidence (insomuch as it is not support by required filings 
consistent with the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure).  
 
In the event the Court deems that Movant Father’s summary judgment “evidence” is 
competent, which is it not, Movant Father’s summary judgment evidence and request is limited in 
this respect as it does not take into account the significant questions of fact that both Mother and 
Movant Father’s allege in their respective pleadings.

SUMMARY JUDGEMENT EVIDENCE

Movant Father’s Motion should be denied because the entirety of his Motion is not
competent summary judgment evidence (insomuch as it is not support by required filings
consistent with the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure).

In the event the Court deems that Movant Father’s summary judgment “evidence” is
competent, which is it not, Movant Father’s summary judgment evidence and request is limited in
this respect as it does not take into account the significant questions of fact that both Mother and
Movant Father’s allege in their respective pleadings.

First, this is not a marriage that solely requires property division. This marriage contains

two children that are subject to this suit. In Mother’s current pleadings, Mother alleges that the

=== PAGE 4 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
appointment of Joint Managing Conservators would not be in the best interest of the children and 
that she should be appointed as sole managing conservator of the children the subject of the suit 
upon final orders due to, in part, Movant Father’s history or battery of family violence, child abuse, 
and/or child neglect and that supervised visitation is required in order to protect the children the 
subject of this suit. These are genuine issues of material fact that require the Court to hear the 
matters at hand to make decisions regarding the best interest of the children.  
The best interest of the children shall always be the primary consideration of the court in 
determining the issues of conservatorship and possession of and access to a child. Texas Family 
Code Section 153.002. Additionally, the Texas Family Code requires the court to consider 
evidence of intentional use of abusive physical force, or evidence of sexual abuse committed 
within a two-year period preceding the filing of the suit or during the suit when making decisions 
regarding sole or joint conservatorship. Tex. Fam. Code Section 153.004(a).  
 
Regardless, these are genuine questions of material fact involving this proceeding and 
evidence of this may be shown in the attached exhibits, Mother’s Affidavit attached herein, as well 
as Mother’s testimony that she plans to give at trial.  
 
Second, there are issues regarding child support and medical support as well as the 
confirmation of child support arrears that have accumulated during the pendency of this proceeding 
that are questions of fact needing litigation to decide alongside the Office of the Attorney General.  
 
Third, Mother is also requesting a disproportionate share of property division for various 
reasons that also raise a question of material facts in this litigation. Mother is requesting a 
disproportionate share of the property due to the following reasons:  
a. Fault in the breakup of the marriage;  
b. Benefits the innocent spouse may have derived from the continuation of the marriage;

The Movant Father’s Motion should be denied because the evidence of these allegations 
establishes a genuine issue of material facts that should be litigated at trial.  
III. 
STANDARD OF REVIEW AND ARGUMENT 
 
The Court’s judgment south shall be rendered forthwith if 1. The deposition of transcripts, 
interrogatory answers, and other discovery responses referenced or set forth in the motion or 
response, and 2. The pleadings, admissions, affidavits, stipulations of the parties and authenticated 
or certified public records, if any, on file at the time of the hearing, or filed thereafter and before 
judgment with permission of the court, show that, except as to the amount of damages, there is no 
genuine issue as to any material fact. Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 166(c).

STANDARD OF REVIEW AND ARGUMENT

The Court’s judgment south shall be rendered forthwith if 1. The deposition of transcripts,
interrogatory answers, and other discovery responses referenced or set forth in the motion or
response, and 2. The pleadings, admissions, affidavits, stipulations of the parties and authenticated
or certified public records, if any, on file at the time of the hearing, or filed thereafter and before
judgment with permission of the court, show that, except as to the amount of damages, there is no
genuine issue as to any material fact. Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 166(c).

In regards to no-evidence summary judgments, a court cannot grant a no-evidence motion

for summary judgment if the responding party produces summary judgment evidence that raises a

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
genuine issue of material fact. TRCP 166(i). This statute is strictly enforced, and courts have held 
that a no-evidence motion that lists each element of the plaintiff’s claim and then asserts that the 
plaintiff has no evidence to support “one or more” or “any of” those elements is insufficient to 
support summary judgment because this language does not clearly identify which elements, 
whether some or all, are challenged. Community Health Sys. V. Prof’l Servs. V. Hansen, 525 
S.W.3d 671, 695-96(Tex.2017).    
In this case, Movant Father has failed to specifically name the claims and elements that 
Petitioner has supposedly no evidence to support. He simply lists family violence, the existence of 
a protective order, financial indigence, and temporary orders as the claims that he is asserting 
Petitioner has no evidence of. However, these listed claims do not match the claims that are 
asserted by Mother and are not the entirety of Mother’s claims asserted in her First or Second 
Amended Petition for Divorce.  
When a motion for no-evidence summary judgment is filed, the burden does shift to the 
responding party to present evidence that raises a genuine issue of material fact to the elements 
specified in the motion. Mack Trucks, Inc. v. Tamez, 206 S.W.3d 572, 581-82 (Tex.2006). This 
evidence is then reviewed in light favorable to the responding party and against the party bringing 
the summary judgement. Id. The responding party is required to provide more than a scintilla of 
evidence in their response for a no-evidence motion for summary judgment to be denied. King 
Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman, 118 S.W.3d 742, 751 (Tex. 2003).  
In this case, there is extensive evidence to prove that there are genuine issues of material 
fact regarding all issues asserted by the Mother in her pleadings, including but not limited to her 
claim that joint managing conservatorship would not be in the best interest of the children and that 
she should be appointed as sole managing conservator, that Movant Father should pay guideline

child support and medical support and what that amount would be, whether Movant Father 
committed family violence, child abuse, and/or child neglect, that Mother should be awarded her 
separate property and what that property is, that Mother should be awarded a disproportionate 
share of community property, that Mother’s information should remain confidential, and that 
Mother should be awarded reasonable attorney’s fees and that previous fees and support should be 
confirmed at final trial.  
Evidence of these claims can be found attached to this response herein and includes, but is 
not limited to:   
1. Pleadings on file in this case;  
2. Communication between parties during the course of this litigation showing threats that 
Movant Father has made to Mother; 
3. Communication between parties showing Movant Father’s inability to exercise his 
possession of the children during his possession time; 
4. Communication between parties showing Movant Father’s inability to keep discussions 
regarding the children solely on AppClose; 
5. Communication between parties showing Movant Father’s continued harassment of 
Mother that shows a pattern of this treatment throughout the litigation; 
6. Mother’s Affidavit; and 
7. Mother’s Financial Statement of Income and Expenses.  
The amount of evidence provided shows more than a scintilla of evidence to prove these 
claims because it does more than create a mere suspicion of an existence of fact. This evidence 
shows patterns of conduct from Movant Father’s that are concerning for the safety of the children 
the subject of the suit, safety for the Mother, and is proof that Mother’s claims and requested relief

CONCLUSION 
 
Movant Father’s Motion for No-Evidence Summary Judgment should be denied because 
he does not accurately state a Motion for No-Evidence Summary Judgment claim.  
Movant Father does not properly assert the elements that he claims Petitioner does not have 
evidence to support.  
Movant Father’s Motion should also be denied because he alleges that there is no genuine 
issue of material fact, even though both pleadings support an issue of material fact, and Mother in 
this Response provides more than a scintilla of evidence to show that there is a material issue of 
fact regarding conservatorship of the children, child support, medical support, property division, 
and attorney’s fees regarding this case.  
Additionally, Mother should be awarded reasonable attorney’s fees in this case as it was in 
the children’s best interest and Mother’s best interest to respond to Movant’s Motion in length and
