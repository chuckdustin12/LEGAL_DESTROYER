Morgan.

It's extremely concerning that you continue to hide behind these orders. yet only seem to selectively follow them based on what's convenient for you.

While | appreciate your efforts to communicate Mara's medical information, your efforts are pointless, as this information could have been given by Mara as she is 8 and a half years old tomorrow and is old enough to explain her
medical procedure regarding her eye to me.

If you want to actually be helpful and fulfill your role in the one-sided temporary orders, you'll need to actually follow them. Otherwise. please don't contact me again while | pursue litigation against you and your family that decided to
implicate themselves in this disaster you've created.

Also - Caroline is nearly 7 years old, lives with all women, yet she comes to me every night she's here asking for a diaper as if there's no effort whatsoever to potty train her.

In the future, you'll need to contact me through an attorney - no - not Cooper Carter, an actual attorney. What you've done over the last year is unacceptable and will be resolved in accordance with the law. The divorce will likely be
dismissed for DWOP given your representation has no ability to prosecute the case.

Even if she did - the blatant fabrication of the IFP you filled out with the assistance of Mr. Branthoover is grounds in and of itself to dismiss the case.
So while you're making your record for trying to be “helpful”, you haven't been. You've been destructive, careless, and reckless, and will have to answer for your actions at some point.

If you're going to use the orders to prevent the girls from talking to their own family and father when requested, then the least you can do is follow the rest of the orders since that seems to be what you live by, as sad as that is given
they were procured by deceit and fraud.

| had my childhood taken from me, and | will not let you get away with what you've done by taking advantage of the hard work | put in for your benefit and my detriment.

| told you in the beginning you would hurt more than just me and the girls, and you've done it. By involving Dan, Meme, and Caitlin, and by showing no remorse or efforts to realize the actual damage you've caused - | hope you
understand that I've been put in a position to ensure everyone is properly adjudicated for their role in the destruction of the girls' status quo.

My mission is clear: shed light on what has happened, and seek damages from those responsible to ensure the girls’ future remains stable.
Don't message me again unless it's an emergency related to the girls.

Charlie

Subject: Read the Orders

To: Morgan Wilson <morganmw02(@gmail.com>

Morgan,

You built your life around the orders you obtained by fraud, so it would serve you well to
actually read them. If any of my property is missing or damaged—which the court
explicitly protects as "personal property"—I will be filing a motion for contempt and
contacting law enforcement. This will be escalated to criminal charges if necessary.

Legal Violations & Consequences

1.

You are explicitly prohibited from destroying, concealing, selling, transferring,
or otherwise disposing of any marital or separate property while the case is
pending.

o (Page 31, Section 6): "J7 JS ORDERED that Petitioner and Respondent are
enjoined from... destroying, removing, concealing, encumbering, transferring,
or otherwise harming or reducing the value of the property of one or both of the
parties."

You are prohibited from altering, deleting, or disposing of financial records or
electronically stored information related to marital assets.

o (Page 33, Section 26): “Destroying, disposing of, or altering any email, text
message, video message, or chat message, or other electronic data or
electronically stored information relevant to the subject matter of this case."

Marital and personal property includes but is not limited to furniture,
electronics, jewelry, tools, firearms, digital assets, vehicles, and all other
personal items.

o (Page 36, Section v-u): The order explicitly lists household items, digital
assets, collectibles, and vehicles as protected property.

If you so much as touch my property in an attempt to get rid of it, you will immediately be
in contempt of court. This is not a threat. This is a legal fact.

LUUL UWa@llit IS UVC

Morgan, your entire case has been built on lies, deception, and fraudulent claims, and it’s
finally catching up with you. Your only evidence consists of fabricated text messages and
baseless accusations that you haven’t even backed up with official filings. You can ery
“abuse” all you want, but reality doesn’t bend to your delusions, and no jury will ever buy
your case, because IT ISN'T ABOUT YOU. IT'S ABOUT THE KIDS.

You can’t run to your grandparents or manipulate people into covering for you this time.
You think you have power, but you don’t. You think you’re in control, but you’re playing
checkers in a chess match you’ve already lost.

Let’s be clear

e You lied to the court to obtain the orders you constantly reference and hold over my
head, yet have no problem blatantly violating them.

e You ignored child support enforcement because your attorney can't prosecute the
case.

e You violated the very same orders you praise because reality has finally started to
corner you.

You cannot win. And I am admitted into two federal courts for a reason. The exact
courts I need to hold you and Dan accountable for what you have done to our children IF I
MUST DO SO.

I'm admitted into two federal courts right now for a reason, and the exact courts I need to be
admitted into in order to hold you - and Dan - accountable for destroying the lives of my
daughters - OUR daughters.

I filed every motion with a specific strategic intent, which was to ensure our children are
protected, and you have not filed a single response, argument, or defense against them.

[ have been more than merciful with you in my requests for relief because it's best for the
kids. You have been downright vile, malicious, and honestly childish.

These emails come off as a threat to you - a nuisance - but it's the only way I'm able to
communicate given your complete detachment from reality.

I honestly don't care about your feelings Morgan. Not anymore. I care about my kids, and
one day - whether it's now - or much later in the future - you'll realize that.

If I were really out to get you, why would I file a motion to dismiss, and not a motion for
sanctions, contempt, or call the police and report your crimes?

BECAUSE IT'S NOT BEST FOR THE KIDS.

Wake up Morgan. You've been asleep since November 30th, 2023. It is now February 2nd,
2025, we've been married for almost ten years, are nowhere close to getting divorced, and if
my personal belongings are disposed of, it will only make the process take even longer.

=== PAGE 6 ===
--- OCR TEXT ---
CC Your attorney, I don't care. She's procedurally check-mated, and she knows it. This has
all been strategy, and you have no moves left.

I would imagine she values her legal career over this dumpster fire of a case.
So either take the loss, discuss this with me like an adult, like the partner and best friend I've
had for the last decade, or continue this path of destruction with no end in sight, no plan, and

with no regard to our children.

I've already had everything taken from me, so I have nothing left to lose - and everything to
gain.

Why would you not take this offer after everything you've done?
What are you so scared of? Facing it? Look what I've had to do the last year - did you think
I wasn't scared when I had to go into court in front of you and your friends who barely know

me and argue with a judge to fight for my children and rights?

It's okay to be scared of Morgan. But you have to remember, even after all of this - it
changes nothing about who I am, who we were, and what we built for our kids.

Please make the right decision here. This can start turning around as quickly as it started.

The choice is YOURS.

At the end of the day, we both lost. So let's get over it and start showing our kids we
can do what's right by them.

This is the way.

Charlie,

Your Husband

Makes sense.

This is not looking good.

Not only has Dan violated multiple protective orders in the past, but he’s already plead guilty to similar conduct in the past, revealing a pattern of behavior.

You also fabricated the affidavit of inability to pay, which makes the case Dismissable under the Texas practice and remedies code and is a class C MISDEMEANOR.

You claimed both kids as dependants
Don't say | didn't give you every opportunity to correct this,
Now it's on you.

Morgan,

Given your accomplice's most recent threat, | will not be picking up the girls tomorrow.

It is unclear what Dan means by his latest threat, so for my own safety and the girls own safety, i will not be subjecting them to any potential violence.

Its crazy to think that you of all people would go to this level of egregiousness. Ironically, you're just strengthening me and the girls relationship long term and destroying yours.
Its blatantly obvious to anyone not involved in this to see how disgusting you ail are acting.

You must have forgotten who | am if you thought | was going to do anything but fight for what's right.

I've always done what | told you | was going to do. Here is no different.

We won't be getting divorced anytime soon, and you have yourself to thank for that alongside your accomplice.

I've been totally up front with you regarding my actions in court yet you keep taking them as threats.

But in reality the threats keep coming from Dan, and you somehow think this helps your case?

Now I can't even see my kids because | don't know what he means by "Deal with me" and what he's referring to when he says "When things all over,"

| will not subject the girls to this possibility of violence, and this has been duly noted.

Stop letting a criminal influence your decisions. Look at the resulting situation.

Tell the girls i love them.

Maybe have them call every once in awhile, you know, through normal means. The only reason I'm not there now with my children is for the simple reason that you won't let me.

The court order is void Morgan. It has no legal effect. This will never change especially given what's happened since it was first drafted.

Morgan,

| only need you to put the bags outside on the days !'m able to see our daughters.

| am fully aware of the girls school events, their obligations, and what she needs to do.

Given that you havent had the girls call on your own accord since the beginning, there's no need for you to contact me unless it's an
emergency or if your intent is to start approaching this from an adult mindset and whats best for our kids, or if you actually plan to start
facilitating a relationship by encouraging contact.

Until then, I'm still pursuing relief and if | need any information regarding the girls | will contact the school or check their website.

| will get them when | can.

Every 1st 3rd and 5th, and on Thursdays. If | won't be getting them on a Thursday, I'll let you know the day prior to ensure you are
kept updated.

Everything else is irrelevant.
Also, Mara missed school today and you forgot to mention it.

I'll be getting the girls on Thursday depending on if | can get the suit filed against Dan. |'ll let you know here by Wednesday at 6pm if
I'll be coming.

Thanks

Keeping you updated, since you still aren't able to see my messages in AppClose.

Mara has a few things coming up. This Thursday, December 12th, is the 3rd grade program. It's at the school at 6pm. She has a
small speaking part. She also has a field trip to see the Nutcracker on Friday, December 13th. No chaperones needed, and her
ticket has already been paid for. They leave in the morning, and are back by 1pm.

Due to the program, we need to make a plan for your Thursday visitation. If you still plan to pick them up from school, | will pack the
clothes Mara needs to wear in her backpack so she can change. You will need to get her back to the school at 5:30. | will be there
at 5:30 so | can fix her hair, if needed.

She also has a solar system project due on January 7th. Since the girls will be with you during most of the break, I'd appreciate it if
you made sure she spent some time working on it. There were multiple options for how she wanted to present it, and she chose
powerpoint. Let her log into Canvas on any computer, and the tools she needs to complete it are there. I'll help her after she gets
back home on the 28th. The info page for the project will be in her binder for reference.

Here's the link for Canvas if you don’t already have it bookmarked:
sslink.com/bisdtx

The holiday shop is going on this week at the school that the girls can shop at and buy gifts for family. If you want to send them with
money, or shop with them during lunch, it closes mid-day on Friday.

Lastly, their class Christmas parties are next week. If you want to volunteer or provide snacks for the class, please email their
teachers. | will not be able to attend due to work. Here are their teachers email addresses:

Hey,

The federal case had posted.

I'm sorry about what | said last night.

| was angry and shouldn't have threatened CPS.

Just please done leave the girls alone and talk to Caitlin about punishment.

I'm reaching out to let you know the case has posted and you have 14 days to comply.
| just want to make sure the process is fair for you and you're aware.

Our case number is 4:24-cv-01185.

I'm going to be filing suit against Dan seeking damages for the amount disclosed last email.

Again, sorry about CPS. | shouldn't have done that. We both know CPS is horrible.

But still.. | am very concerned about the kids.

I'll be picking them up after school today and will bring them back Sunday.

Have a good afternoon.

Hello,

While | appreciate your transparency, it's interesting that you wish to follow the orders when convenient for you, however, refuse to
have our daughter call for multiple days around a critical time of year such as thanksgiving.

As far as your attorney, her authority has still not been proven, so it is unclear who is actually representing you.

The above is a certificate of service by your attorney when she worked at Marx Altman and Johnson.

2. As far as documentation, you have failed to respond to the discovery request served back on September 19th, 2024, which
included admissions.

When a party fails to respond to a request for admissions, the requests are deemed admitted "without the necessity of a court order."
Tex.R.Civ.P. 198.2(c). Admissions of fact on file at the time of a summary judgment hearing constitute competent summary judgment
evidence. Acevedo v. Comm'n for Lawyer Discipline, 131 S.W.3d 99, 105 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 2004, pet. denied); Mackie v.
Guthrie, 78 S.W.3d 462, 468 (Tex. App.-Tyler 2001, pet. denied) (citing Tex.R.Civ.P. 166a(c)).

There is a pending summary judgement which is also unresponded to, filed and served on February 22nd, 2024.

This means that all admissions of fact will be admitted into evidence at the summary judgement hearing should the Federal District
Court for the Northern District of Texas remand the case for lack of jurisdiction.

The summary judgement hearing is the oldest motion on record, and will be the first motion scheduled for hearing if necessary on
remand.
3. As far as the orders are concerned, they also state the following:

“That the marital address is 6641 Anns Court, which is not correct. This was pointed out prior to its rendition, and no amendment
has been filed.

*That the parties must take the parenting class and file a notice of completion with the court, which you failed to do.

*That the Petitioner receive exclusive use of the residency pending the divorce. In Pennsylvania, Texas, New Jersey, and most
other states in the US, there’s an administrative order known as the status quo, which requires the soon-to-be ex-spouses to shun
from disrupting the norm created throughout the length of the marriage. "Exclusive" - meaning excluding or not admitting other
things. By moving in your sister to the residence, you are not "exclusively" using the marital home with the children.

=== PAGE 25 ===
--- OCR TEXT ---
“That the Petitioner acquire healthcare for the children - there has been no indication that this has occurred.

*That the Petitioner pay monthly rent costs to Margie Wilson. This has not been occurring as ordered as evidenced by
documentation from Margie Wilson given in June of 2024.

* That | agree to the orders, as evidenced by a signature that doesn't exist.

You can keep attempting to bury your wrongdoings and the reality of this situation, but until all of the above are followed, the texting
over AppClose should be the least of your worries.

| will be picking up the girls on Thursday after school.
Have a good evening.
| have CC'd your attorney for transparency and for my own documentation.

Subject: A Final Reminder

To: Morgan Wilson <morganmw02@ gmail.com>

Morgan,

Just as a final reminder - here's the reality of damage you've caused yet remain completely silent on. None of this will just go away
despite your current set-up with the false sense of security granted to you by the court:

MONETARY:

1. Lost Income

Income at the start of the divorce: $4,600

Current monthly income: $2,000

Monthly income loss: $2,600/month and gaining.

Duration of income loss: 12 months

Total lost income: $2,600 x 12 = $31,200 + forward looking losses

2. Living Expenses

e Airbnb costs (to remain near my daughters) for as long as possible: $14,000
e Hotel Costs: $960.45
e Total increased living expenses: $14,000 + $960.45 = $14,960.45

3. Travel and Transportation Costs

e Tolls for visitation and transportation to see daughters: $1,800
e Car repairs caused by wife’s damage: $1,600
e Total travel and transportation costs: $1,800 + $1,600 = $3,400

4. Misappropriated Funds

e Funds stolen from joint account by Morgan and Dan Branthoover: $1,576

5. Business Opportunity Cost

e Estimated lost revenue from business opportunities and advertisements: $46,000

6. Legal and Related Costs

e Legal fees and associated costs related to this situation: $3,000

7. Emotional Distress

e The financial and physical strain from being displaced, combined with the emotional distress of limited access to my
daughters, has caused significant emotional harm. A claim for emotional damages in the amount of $1,000 is being sought
per month that this continues or until justification is provided.

Start = March 6th, 2024.
today = December 5th, 2024.
As of tomorrow, totaling to: $11,000

=== PAGE 27 ===
--- OCR TEXT ---
Total amount in emotional distress: $11,000

8. Punitive Damages

To address and deter malicious or negligent actions. $50,000.

Total Damages

Lost Income: $31,200

Living Expenses: $14,960.45

Travel and Transportation Costs: $3,400
Misappropriated Funds: $1,576
Business Opportunity Cost: $13,000
Legal and Related Costs: $5,000
Emotional Distress: $11,000

Punitive Damages: $50,000

Total Damages: $123,136.45

How is this destruction what's best for our kids?

CIVIL:

1. | will be contacting child protective services to open an investigation for the foregoing:

a. reports of the children being hurt by Caitlin, grabbing their arms.

b. the children being left home alone at night without an adult present.

This is inexscusable.

CRIMINAL:

Conspiracy to Commit Fraud (Interstate Crime):

On December 14, 2023, you attempted to have me illegally removed from the marital home. This was not due to violence or
any legitimate cause, but because | uncovered the unhealthy volume of communications between you, Debbie, and
Damen, revealing your deceptive behavior and abandonment of marital responsibilities waived off as 'emotional support’.

e Text records evidence daily, excessive correspondence with those two individuals, and other records prove a
"meeting of the minds" with your grandparents and Dan Branthoover, who actively assisted you in defrauding the
court.

o Interstate Travel for Fraudulent Purposes: You crossed state lines to recieve assistance in drafting falsified
paperwork, directly causing my removal from the home. This constitutes interstate fraud and conspiracy, a
federal offense.

e Your argument of "emotional support" is not believable especially given your infidelity in the past.

Defrauding the Marital Estate:
You deliberately removed $1,576 from the marital estate under false pretenses. This theft was malicious, unjustified, and
completely disregarded our children’s welfare around the Christmas holidays.

False Indigence Declaration:
You misled the court by falsely claiming indigence, despite clear evidence that you had access to sufficient funds. This
fraudulent act constitutes perjury, as it was intended to gain unlawful advantage through the court system.

Malicious Conduct with Intent to Harm:

Your actions were not isolated incidents but part of a larger pattern of calculated, malicious behavior designed to paint
yourself as a victim while disregarding the truth and well-being of your family. These actions demonstrate a willful disregard
for legal, moral, and parental responsibilities.

=== PAGE 28 ===
--- OCR TEXT ---
Child Neglect:
e Your actions demonstrate a willful disregard for the well-being of our children, including but not limited to:

» Financial Neglect: You maliciously removed marital funds, depriving our children of basic financial support
during the holidays.

» Emotional Neglect: Your preoccupation with deceptive actions and conspiracies left our children without
the parental stability and care they deserve.

Intentional Disruption: By orchestrating my removal from the home, you knowingly caused emotional
distress and instability to our children, prioritizing your fraudulent schemes over their needs.

Under Texas law, it is a crime to not report child neglect, so unless you are ready to start acting like an adult and address the
above,
You've destroyed the status quo of our children, and attempted to reduce me to a child support payment, which ultimately failed.

You have until December 13th, 2024 to either explain how all of the above are incorrect and provide details of how this situation is
what's best for anyone. | will be contacting Child Protective Services regardless given the reports of physical abuse taking place.

I'm not pursuing legal action against your attorney at this time given she was an unfortunate victim in all of this as well.

There's no amount of evidence or time that will absolve you of your actions. You must choose between right and wrong, or face the
consequences.

If the tables were turned, I'd never allow what has transpired to happen - even if | felt "threatened" by you.

Make the call.

Hey,
Just so you know - if you've been replying or sending me emails - | have you blocked.

The reason for this is you provide nothing for this co parenting relationship of value. You're just a toxic human being with no regard for
anyone but yourself.

You aren't even aa parent anymore.
What part of your brain thinks you're doing the right thing?
You realize you're still sleeping on the bed my mom gave us, so why haven't you thrown that out to the curb? Because you need it?

Our kids have neither parent now. You're making less than | made before you destroyed everything, and you are doing EXACTLY what
| said you would in the beginning.. using your grandparents just like you always have.

Three reminders:

1. | still live at 6641 Anne Ct, Watauga, TX 76148.

2. We will not be divorced until you're held accountable by either the judges or a jury trial.

3. You had an affair, got caught, and this is all a ruse to escape accountability.

Attached will be the evidence showing that you took my personal property and threw it on the curb, clearly with anger.
Despite all of this, | still pray for you each night.

Its the first thing she said when | picked her up.

Also, what you're doing with Damen is sickening.

They both specifically told me you're claiming we are divorced, that Damen is your new boyfriend, and that you kiss him in front of
them. Have you stopped to think about how this affects them? I didn't even ask. They brought it up because it makes them

uncomfortable.. which any person with normal morals would understand.

| mean.. gaslighting the kids now too? Really? We are not divorced.. and wont be until you're held accountable for what you've done..
you know this.

This just further showcases your complete disregard for their emotional well being and proves exactly what you swore up and down
wasn't going on when | originally discovered the extent of your communication with Damen and Debbie.

I'll keep you updated about Maras stomach, but wow.. truly disturbing behavior. What a class act you've found there.
Its going to be interesting next time we are in court for sure given we haven't been since March 14, 2024.

You're either lying to Damen also about us being divorced, or you're just completely devoid of any typical human compassion and
empathy.

This is where a jury trial will help, because nobody in their right mind would look at this situation and say that what's happened is in the
kids best interests.

Mara just went to the bathroom so hopefully that's all it was.

If anything else comes up I'll let you know.

You have a one track mind.

The orders are void.

Maybe you should get your attorney to prosecute your case.

Your whole existence depends on these orders that you don't even follow and that you lied to obtain.
Its truly pathetic.

You can't win this case. Period.

The longer you keep pretending, the worse it's going to be for all of us.

If only you could think for yourself we wouldn't even be in this spot.

Think past the next 5 minutes and realize the reality of the situation you've created.

Those orders are cookie cutter orders that are not in the best interests of our kids. They're in the best interest of you, which isn't a
thing.

Grow up and take the parenting class that "tHe oRdeRs sAy" maybe you'll learn something.

We need to seriously talk.

| developed a trading algorithm that a company called tradytics wants to purchase to provide an initial line of equity for $1.6 million
dollars after a 6 month testing period to power their upcoming products.

I'm signing an NDA tomorrow at noon and won't be able to discuss any details after then.

That means in July they'll be read to close if everything goes well, and will extend the line of equity on a 2 year contract netting
$800,000 per year minus taxes.

This is serious money that our kids and we could benefit from despite the divorce.

I've been working nearly 20 hour days trying to survive in the current situation, they know about the divorce, and want it finalized
before moving forward.

Also, if you're going to keep up this current narrative, I'm going to have to schedule depositions with you, Damen, and Debbie, and
Caitlin with a court reporter somewhere in Tarrant county as soon as possible so | can get answers regarding the 16,500 text
messages exchanged from October 2022 to December 2023 and other matters. I'll serve you an official request through the EFM so
you'll have all of the details.

If | don't hear anything by Friday I'll have to issue subpoenas which I'd really prefer not to do.

I've tried to contact cooper regarding this, but as always she never replies.

I'd like to have it scheduled and done by the end of the week of the 20th, because | also have Dan's lawsuit to handle as well.

Thanks and have a good day.

trades. You keep 30% for now (happy to change this number), and

10% of ALL blotter revenue goes to you for the next 6 months, we
can revise the number after that (revenue is not that much right
now just FYI :P, but we can work together to increase it)

We do a trading session with Tradytics 100k community every
week or two, and help traders learn to use data. This will allow us
to merge FUD, BLOTTER & TRADYTICS. We just have to make sure
that we're using all three tools to showcase the impact so that we
can have users everywhere.

Due to the possibility of inclement weather, | don't think it would be safe for the girls to come all the way out here and potentially get
stuck.

l'll keep an eye on the roads between now and then.

As far as the Divorce.. not sure what you're doing, but we're just wasting time. I'm really running out of patience here. Might as well
just be an adult and deal with what we need to deal with sooner than later.. because it's coming whether you like it or not, and whether
it takes two years, five years or ten, we can't move forward until we deal with what we need to deal with.

One day, I'll be back in the home we built our children's lives in.. where all my stuff is, my kids are, and what | need to provide for
them. Same song and same dance. That was our matrimonial home since day 1, and it would be a lot easier for everyone if you would
put your fake new life with Damen on hold for a minute so we can take care of business, | can be given time to fix this and transition
NEAR-BY the kids, and we can move on.

You can't just take all of that away from someone because you feel entitled to it. What if the same happened to you? How would you
feel?

Anyways,

Bye

Morgan,

So at the start of case, you not only traveled across state lines to receive assistance in filing
fraudulent paperwork to secure an advantage in the divorce, made false allegations leading
to the destruction of our kids status quo, but you went as far as claiming the case was
uncontested?

In what universe did you think you would get away with this?

I've requested the affidavit of inability you filed, and if it comes back with fraudulent
statements such as claiming the girls as dependants or fabricating my income and your
financial obligations or my financial obligations, I will be contacting local law enforcement
because this is atrocious and blatant criminal activity.

I've already verified dmb575 is Dan's paypal.

You really need to start thinking about the big picture here Morgan.

Subject: You're going to have to explain yourself eventually

Morgan,

When you first announced your desire for a divorce, you told me that you had a
plan in place.

You said the marriage was destroyed because of how I talked to you and
assured me that the girls’ lives wouldn’t be worse, just “different.”

You insisted there were no affairs, and that this decision was in the best interest
of the kids. But then you dismissed over 16,000 texts between Debbie and
Damen as “emotional support" and brought Damen around our children daily.

He’s been telling my children good night, acting as though he belongs in their
lives after I was removed.

You promised stability for the girls, but all I see is chaos. You’ ve introduced
someone into their world who doesn’t belong, and their security has been
shattered. Everything you've done since then contradicts your original reasons.

You then proceeded to create a false narrative of protection. You changed
phones, got this second email, and got mace.

This was never about what’s best for the kids—it’s about your priorities, and
sadly, they revolve around everyone except our family.

=== PAGE 52 ===
--- OCR TEXT ---
You've reduced your own employment, made no effort to find full-time work,
and continually put your selfish agenda ahead of the kids’ well-being.

You claim to have an attorney, yet she only surfaces to ambush me in court. You
justify your actions because you can’t think for yourself—you’ve let others, like
Debbie and Damen, dictate your life and decisions. They’ve injected
themselves into our family’s situation without understanding or caring about the
consequences, and then you hire an attorney who has never had children and
shares the same flaws: no communication and can't think for herself (compelled
by Kaitcer to represent you)

For years, you took advantage of me—never carrying your weight, always
putting everything else above the kids.

You used to be a great mom, but since Debbie and Damen entered your life,
you've become someone entirely different.

You blame me for everything, but the evidence tells a different story.

You cling to false allegations of violence and drug use, bringing them up only
when it benefits you. If these concerns were real, you would’ve acted long ago.
And if you weren't hiding something, you wouldn't be telling Mara things like,
“you still love me deep down inside", which only confuses them further. You
should listen to your heart, because that's the only good thing I've heard from
you since this all started.

You're hurting and confusing our children. You’ve destroyed the work I
dedicated countless hours to build for them, and you have neither the ability nor
the ambition to replace it. You’re doing exactly what I feared—treverting to
someone who relies on her grandparents and uses those around her. But this
time, it’s not just about you—your decisions are directly impacting our
children’s future.

You don’t help them with school. You don’t take them anywhere fun. You
consistently prioritize your friends, Debbie and Damen, over the kids, who are
left feeling neglected. You point fingers at me, but your actions have left a trail
of destruction.

When I’m nearby, Damen suddenly disappears. You think you're covering up
your actions, but I know the truth. I've known the truth this entire time. You’ve
done all of this to hide your own mistakes, including extramarital affairs, while
gaslighting me—the only person who ever tried to provide for you—into
believing everything was fine.

You lie and deceive both your family and the court to avoid being held
accountable, and you think you hold power because of the court’s errors and
your attorney’s personal connections.

you dian I even take tne court-orderea parenung Class, wnicn proves you aon t
care about the kids. If you did, we wouldn’t be here. You’d own up to your
mistakes like an adult, not place the blame on me while running from
accountability like a child.

The statute of limitations is running out to protect myself against the actions
taken against me, and I’ve been more than patient. I've been taunted by Dan
who says egregious things like he's been "thoroughly enjoying watching me get
denied", and your own grandmother has called expressing her concerns about
the kids and that "you're not acting like yourself."

You can’t undo the damage you’ve caused, and one day the kids will see it all.
They already tell me how you never spend time with them, how you're always
on the phone with friends, and how they’re constantly pawned off on your
grandparents.

Who are you? You're becoming the person you always said you'd never be.

I'll always give Morgan a chance, but this isn’t you. Your complete lack of
communication is inexcusable. You got what you wanted by lying, and now you
think you can reduce me to nothing more than a child support payment and live
your new fantasy with Damen.

When will you understand that I will never stop fighting to protect our children
and secure their future?

You, on the other hand, are lost, and will have to explain to these girls one day
why you chose to destroy their family at such a critical time of year and without
ever providing any real answers, only introduce a new figure into their life as a
replacement for their Father.

But you know what? Despite all of this.. I still love you. And I'm sorry for
everything I did regarding the marriage. And no, not somewhere deep down.
Still strong on the surface of my heart. These words come from there and
nowhere else.

The critical difference is what you've done here is unrepairable on your own.
It's a total disregard for the last decade of effort. You need my help fixing what
you've damaged.

The point is - if I'm able to go through all of this - and still be here and am able
to realize that there's a better way for our kids than the current path.. why can't
you?

The world doesn't have to know.

You married me for a reason Morgan, the same as I did you.

of this started - we provided a perfect life for our kids.

But your fantasy world is more important now and it's sad to see.
You blamed me for the marriage, but whos' fault is it now? Is it still mine? Have
you tried putting yourself in my shoes, or the kids' shoes? Doing so makes the

current situation anything but logical. It's sickening.

We all make mistakes. That doesn't mean we can destroy everything so we may
run away from them.

That doesn't mean we tell our kids that their vacations weren't good.

It's not too late to turn this around, but we're running out of time.

You're going to have to explain yourself eventually, and to the kids as well. Will
you lie to them, too? Because again, the evidence tells a different story, and
when they are old enough to think for themselves, they'll see it clearly.

The only people who don't are the ones you associate with, your attorney who
can't follow the law, and the judges who got caught condoning this behavior

when I fired Dan Bacalis.

There is no legal basis to justify the current arrangement, and it will inevitably
be corrected. Each day you allow yourself to go by is another day the kids lose.

It's time to grow up, Morgan. You're almost in your mid 30s, and expect a
lifestyle that was afforded to you by the Husband you discarded like trash, lied
to, and cheated on multiple times.

The reality you see around you now is the stability that's lacking which was
provided by my efforts to support you and the kids. You expect that same level
of stability and support while depriving me of my vehicle to make it happen,
and this can't change until time is given.. no matter how much time passes.
And yet, again, I still love you.

That's how I know I'm going in the right direction.

Please wake up. These kids only have one childhood.

All I know is that at the end of the day - I can tell our children I did everything
in my power to ensure that their future was protected.

Can you say the same?

You can't fix this. I can't fix this.

=== PAGE 55 ===
--- OCR TEXT ---
We can fix this.

Nobody else can.

Whether we're married or not. For our children.
Besides, what's the end goal here?

The bubble you're currently living in May support your decisions. Will the
world?

I've rejected 4 media interviews because #1 you know 1 hate that shit, and #2
out of respect for your privacy.

People are interested in this story. Not because of the things leading up to it -
but because of what's happening in the court given Tarrant county has been
known for abusive practices in family law.

I'm interested in my kids future.
Period.
This is my last attempt to get through to you.

I've done all I can, and I'll be able to prove it to the kids when they're older and
have questions that I tried my very hardest.

To: Cooper Carter <coopercarter@ majadmin.com>

Good evening!
| just saw this email from Mr Myers. | don’t plan on responding, unless you think there’s something specific | should say. | obviously do
not agree to his terms. Would it be best to let the 48 hours run out and force his hand to make a motion? Would that work the same

way as if he were to schedule a hearing for the Rule 12?

Thank you!

To: Morgan Wilson <morganmw02@ gmail.com>

Morgan,

Pursuant to Tarrant County Local Rule 4.01(10)(b) and in accordance with the provisions of the Texas Family Code, this
letter serves as formal notice of Respondent's intent to file for temporary orders with the Court on 09/26/2024. This communication
constitutes a good faith effort to resolve the matters at hand without necessitating judicial intervention.

1. Residency and Custodial Arrangements

The Respondent will not seek an injunction for exclusive use of the residence during the recovery period, as the primary
concern for maintaining the residency is based on financial necessity rather than any intention to deprive you of your home or
access to the children. The Respondent will request primary joint conservatorship during the recovery period to protect the status
quo of the children. This arrangement will remain in place until Respondent is able to secure alternative housing in close proximity,
should you choose to waive the option of cohabitation, as described below, to ensure the children remain in their home during the
transition.

2. Business Losses and Financial Impact

The abrupt exclusion from the residence has significantly hindered Respondent's ability to operate his business, resulting in a
41% loss of clientele and a 50% decrease in revenue. This not only affects Respondent's financial stability but also impedes the
ability to support the minor children.

To remedy this, the Respondent will demand a recovery schedule that grants 1.25 days for each day of missed parenting
time and property deprivation. This is to address not only the lost time with the children but also the financial losses incurred due to
the combined actions of your attorney and the trial court which stemmed from your initial pleadings. You may remain in the residence
during this period; however, if this arrangement proves impractical or undesirable, Respondent will petition the Court for primary
conservatorship under Texas Family Code § 156.101, thereby modifying the current custodial order to reverse the conservatorship
roles.

Upon your response, Respondent will furnish documentation substantiating these losses, including financial statements, client
termination records, and revenue reports, in compliance with Texas Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 194 regarding disclosure of
information.

3. Validity of Current Temporary Orders

Given that the current orders have been filed by an attorney potentially lacking proper authority to represent you, they potentially
contravene Texas Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 12 and the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct. Furthermore,
Respondent was not served with any supporting motion as mandated by Texas Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 21a, and the orders
were entered as "agreed" despite Respondent's prior withdrawal of consent, rendering them voidable under Texas precedent.

Given these procedural deficiencies, the ongoing appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas, and the question of authority regarding
your attorney - there exists a substantial likelihood that the current temporary orders may be declared rightfully void ab initio, which will
require new orders be put in place. Respondent seeks to address and rectify this matter amicably, without further court involvement
with orders that truly suit the children's best interests.

The rushed nature of the decisions made here now have wasted an extraordinary amount of time, and Respondent believes
the terms of these orders are the quickest way to a final decree of divorce at this time.

4. Financial Support Obligations
To promote the welfare of Mara and Caroline during the recovery window, Respondent agrees to:

- Resume payment of $800 per month in rent for the marital residence to Margie Evonne Wilson and will seek a temporary injunction
enjoining her from harassing, threatening, or otherwise disturbing the peace of the Respondent or the Children during the recovery
period.

- Assume financial responsibility for both vehicles, including payment for associated insurance and Respondent's phone services.
- Secure health insurance coverage for the minor children.

- Cover 100% of all medical, dental, and psychological expenses incurred on behalf of the children.

The Respondent will further seek that the court requires child support payments amounting to 10% of your net monthly income during
the recovery period.

5. Damages Incurred

1U Udie, MESPVUCIIt tad HiGuireu Udlliayes ULAHIY 9v94,90Y, tI ICUINIpasoiliy.
- Business losses due to decreased clientele and revenue.
- Additional living expenses stemming from the change in residence.
- Other related costs directly associated with the current situation regarding the ability to exercise visitation with Mara and Caroline.

- Detailed documentation supporting these damages, including expense reports and financial records, will be provided upon your
response for purposes of transparency and potential restitution.

6. Request for Temporary Injunction

The Respondent will seek a temporary injunction to preserve the status quo and protect the financial interests of the minor
children during the recovery period. Respondent will request that the Court waive the requirement of a bond under 105.001(d) of the
Texas Family Code for the welfare of Mara and Caroline given that the injunction aims solely to safeguard the welfare of the children.

7. Next Steps and Request for Response

In light of the pending Rule 12 motion challenging the authority of your current counsel, Respondent is directing this correspondence
to you personally. You may forward this correspondence to Ms. Carter if you deem necessary.

Upon your response, Respondent is prepared to provide all relevant documentation and answer any questions pertaining to:
- The calculated damages and financial losses incurred.

- The loss of clients and revenue impacts.

- Any other pertinent information necessary for the resolution of this matter.

- The need for the residency

- The logistics moving forward

Respondent remains committed to reaching an equitable and swift resolution in the best interests of Mara and Caroline, in accordance
with Texas Family Code § 153.002. The current trajectory must be reassessed, and this is another opportunity to do so.

If no response is given within 48 hours, or if no meaningful conversation can be obtained, | will be filing the Motion for Temporary
Orders with the court.

Despite the damage done, that doesn't mean that things can't begin to turn around for Mara and Caroline's sake.

After the recovery, we can revisit custody arrangements and visitation schedules to determine what's best for all parties once an
alternate residency is secured to preserve the financial stability of the children.

Please provide a written response within 48 hours of receipt of this letter. Failure to respond will compel Respondent to proceed with
filing the motion and to certify to the Court that reasonable efforts were made to resolve these matters without judicial intervention, as
required by Tarrant County Local Rule 4.01(10)(b).

Best,

Charlie
