Before me is a pleading entitled Motion to Recuse Judge Munford filed by Charles Dustin 
Myers. This motion was referred to me after Judge James Munford declined to recuse himself 
by order dated September 9, 2025. 
Mr. Myers has filed three or more motions to recuse and/or disqualify judges in this case. 
When a party files his third motion to recuse in a case, the judge(s) must move the case to final 
disposition as though a tertiary recusal motion had not been filed. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code 
§ 30.016 (b) (3); Gonzalez v. Guilbot, 315 S.W.3d 533 (Tex. 2010). That is, once a tertiary 
motion to recuse is filed, the judges assigned to the case are required to proceed and cannot delay 
the case because of the filing of a motion to recuse. 
Further, sanctions are mandatory if a tertiary recusal motion is denied. Tex. Civ. Prac. & 
Rem. Code§ 30.016 (c), which provides as follows: 
A judge hearing a tertiary recusal motion against another judge who denies the motion 
shall award reasonable and necessary attorney's fees and costs to the party opposing the motion. 
The party making the motion and the attorney for the party are jointly and severally liable for 
the award of fees and costs. The fees and costs must be paid before the 31st day after the date the 
order denying the tertiary recusal motion is rendered, unless the order is properly superseded.

Before me is a pleading entitled Motion to Recuse Judge Munford filed by Charles Dustin
Myers. This motion was referred to me after Judge James Munford declined to recuse himself
by order dated September 9, 2025.

Mr. Myers has filed three or more motions to recuse and/or disqualify judges in this case.
When a party files his third motion to recuse in a case, the judge(s) must move the case to final
disposition as though a tertiary recusal motion had not been filed. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code

motion to recuse is filed, the judges assigned to the case are required to proceed and cannot delay
the case because of the filing of a motion to recuse.

Further, sanctions are mandatory if a tertiary recusal motion is denied. Tex. Civ. Prac. &
Rem. Code § 30.016 (c), which provides as follows:

A judge hearing a tertiary recusal motion against another judge who denies the motion
Shall award reasonable and necessary attorney's fees and costs to the party opposing the motion.
The party making the motion and the attorney for the party are jointly and severally liable for
the award of fees and costs. The fees and costs must be paid before the 31st day after the date the

order denying the tertiary recusal motion is rendered, unless the order is properly superseded.

I have reviewed the motion as to Judge Munford and the motion fails to meet the 
requirements of Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 18a(a) because it does not state with detail and 
particularity admissible facts that would justify recusal or disqualification if proven. Tex. R. Civ. 
P. 18a(a)(4). 
IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED THAT: 
1. The motion to recuse is denied as to Judge Munford without hearing Tex. R. Civ. 
P l 8a(g)(3)(A), (i). 
2. All judges in this case will comply with Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 30.016 
(b) (3) requiring judges to move the case to final disposition as though a tertiary 
recusal motion had not been filed. 
3. The issue of the mandatory sanctions required by Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§ 
30.016 (c) will be handled as follows: 
a. The parties entitled to sanctions will file on or before October 3, 2025, a
