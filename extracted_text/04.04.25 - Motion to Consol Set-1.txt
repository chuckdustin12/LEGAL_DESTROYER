All,
While I respect the Court's administrative responsibilities, I must again emphasize that these responsibilities include
ensuring that proceedings are conducted within the bounds of jurisdiction and procedural law as well as improving justice
and expediting the processing of cases through the courts.
That isn't happening here.
As a pro se litigant, I take seriously my duty to aid in the efficient administration of justice as I am held to the same
standards as licensed attorneys. That includes timely raising jurisdictional objections, preserving the record, and
preventing the court from engaging in proceedings that are void or wasteful.
Setting a hearing on a motion that the court cannot lawfully decide—especially weeks in advance—undermines that
purpose and risks wasting everyone’s time and resources. I’ve acted in good faith to raise these concerns now, so that
judicial time is not misallocated on a setting that cannot produce a valid result.
To be clear: this Court lacks jurisdiction to consolidate a matter that is not pending before it. Setting a hearing on
such a motion—absent any transfer of the SAPCR case from the 233rd District Court—is procedurally unsound and

jurisdictionally improper. This concern is not theoretical; it is a statutory and constitutional defect that cannot be cured
by scheduling preferences or delayed hearings.
These objections have been raised repeatedly in the pleadings. Opposing counsel continues to ignore them and proceeds
as if the jurisdictional prerequisite for consolidation has been met—it has not.Therefore, reiterating these issues is done
to preserve the record to protect my rights.
Even more troubling is the suggestion that this hearing be delayed until late April. The delay does nothing to resolve the
threshold issue: this Court cannot lawfully entertain a motion concerning a case over which it has no authority.
Setting such a hearing nearly a month out is not merely inefficient.
Let me be clear: these are not legal arguments, these are statutory facts, and they are being restated here solely to:
Preserve procedural objections,
Clarify the record, and
Prevent further waste of judicial resources.
There is little justification for continued delay at this point—particularly considering that Ms. Carter previously moved to
block emergency relief in the 233rd District Court without acknowledging these jurisdictional conflicts.
If opposing counsel wishes to delay this hearing until late April, that is her prerogative.
However, I respectfully state for the record that:
I will not be providing availability for a hearing that is both procedurally and jurisdictionally improper.
Respectfully,
Charles Dustin Myers
