has not filed anything into the case since April 24, 2024, nearly twelve months ago. 
 
 
CONCLUSION 
For these reasons, unless a response is filed by the proper attorney of record, or  
COOPER L. CARTER’s authority is Proven pursuant to Rule 12 of the Texas Rules of  
Civil Procedure, it would be not only inappropriate to grant this motion filed by a nonparty,  
but it would also be prejudicial to not address the objection filed by the Respondent. 
 
Cooper L. Carter’s attempt to consolidate are to interfere with relief the children  
desperately needed, and in the face of a matter she hasn’t been prosecuting. Further, the court  
cannot proceed with the motion until COOPER L. CARTER satisfies her obligations pursuant to  
Rule 237a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, as outlined in the objection filed April 2, 2025. 
 
 
Respectfully submitted,
