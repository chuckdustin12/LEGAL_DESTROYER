I. BACKGROUND
1.
On September 26, 2025, this Court entered two orders (attached as Exhibits 1 and 2)
purporting to summarily deny two motions to recuse (one titled “Motion to Recuse Judge 
Munford” and one titled “Motion to Recuse Judge Kaitcer”). In reality, Respondent filed only a 
single motion on September 5, 2024 (file-stamped 11:25 A.M., attached as Exhibit 3) titled 
“Motion to Recuse”, which solely sought recusal of Judge James Munford. Nowhere in that 
motion was Associate Judge Jeff Kaitcer named or implicated. This misidentification mirrors the 
error that arose during prior recusal proceedings (leading to Texas Supreme Court case nos. 25-
0426 and 25-0458), where the Court erroneously referenced two separate recusal motions 
(against both Judge Munford and Judge Kaitcer) when in fact only one motion (later amended) 
against Judge Munford had been filed. 
2.
These actions are not the actions of an impartial Court. At the Regional level of the
judiciary, on multiple occasions, we are putting our feelings regarding self-represented litigants 
before the law – even when his legal position is correct and unopposed by any party. 
3.
Perhaps even more concerning is that this Court ordered the other side to file a motion
for sanctions when they did not oppose the motion to recuse. The Court acts as if there isn’t a 
case docket that supports these facts and continues to operate in a manner that exhibits clear 
favoritism towards an incompetent and unethical attorney who has not defended her client’s 
crimes as alleged. 
4.
Finally, the opposing party actually filed the motion for sanctions and requested $10,000
in attorney’s fees without the required exhibits in a boilerplate motion which labeled 
Respondent’s motions as “frivolous” despite not responding to a single one of them. Exhibit 4. 
5.
There is no rational basis for these actions, and these orders must be vacated immediately.

II. GROUNDS TO VACATE THE ORDER SUMMARILY DENYING THE MOTION TO
RECUSE 
6. 
The Court’s orders issued on September 26, 2025, explicitly reference two motions. 
Exhibit 1 references a motion titled “Motion to Recuse Associate Judge Kaitcer”, while Exhibit 2 
references a motion titled “Motion to Recuse Judge Munford”. However, Exhibit 3 clearly shows 
the title of the motion is “Motion to Recuse”. The Court cannot deny motions which were never 
filed, therefore the orders issued September 26, 2025, as to the order summarily denying the 
motions to recuse must be vacated, and the original unadjudicated motion should be considered 
on its’ merits. See Exhibit 3 (original motion filed with the Court). 
III. GROUNDS TO  VACATE ORDER DIRECTING THE CASE TO PROCEED TO
TRIAL PURSUANT TO TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 30.016 
7. 
The orders which reference non-existent motions cite 30.016 of the Texas Practice and 
Remedies Code as its’ reasoning to proceed to final trial. This does not require a court order and 
is automatic by statute. The reasoning for this order seems to be in reference to Judge James 
Munford’s “Order of Referral” where he declined to recuse himself from the case and referred 
the motion to the Regional Judge. Exhibit 5. When comparing Exhibits 3 (the original Motion to 
Recuse) and Exhibit 5 (the order of referral with attached motion to recuse), they are not the same 
thing. The referred motion, similar to the motions filed in the prior two recusal proceedings, was 
modified to remove the bookmarks and hyperlinks, thereby affecting its readability. 
8. 
The original motion, as filed, was not forwarded to the Regional Judge in its’ original or 
certified form, as required by law, in any of the recusal proceedings to date. 
9. 
For these reasons, the order directing the case to proceed to trial pursuant to Tex. Civ. 
Prac. & Rem. Code § 30.016 is legally unnecessary and this order should be vacated.

6. The Court’s orders issued on September 26, 2025, explicitly reference two motions.
Exhibit I references a motion titled “Motion to Recuse Associate Judge Kaitcer’, while Exhibit 2
references a motion titled “Motion to Recuse Judge Munford”. However, Exhibit 3 clearly shows

filed, therefore the orders issued September 26, 2025, as to the order summarily denying the
motions to recuse must be vacated, and the original unadjudicated motion should be considered
on its’ merits. See Exhibit 3 (original motion filed with the Court).

Ill. GROUNDS TO VACATE ORDER DIRECTING THE CASE TO PROCEED TO

7. The orders which reference non-existent motions cite 30.016 of the Texas Practice and
Remedies Code as its’ reasoning to proceed to final trial. This does not require a court order and
is automatic by statute. The reasoning for this order seems to be in reference to Judge James

certified form, as required by law, in any of the recusal proceedings to date.

9. For these reasons, the order directing the case to proceed to trial pursuant to Tex. Civ.

Prac. & Rem. Code § 30.016 is legally unnecessary and this order should be vacated.

IV. GROUNDS TO VACATE ORDER RE MANDATORY SANCTIONS FOR THE 
FILING OF TERTIARY RECUSAL MOTION 
 
10. 
The Court cannot order a party to file a motion for sanctions regarding 1) a motion that 
was never filed and 2) a motion that was never opposed. The Court’s own order highlights this 
when it cites to Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§ 30.016 (c), which states “A judge hearing a 
tertiary recusal motion against another judge who denies the motion shall award reasonable and 
necessary attorney's fees and costs to the party opposing the motion.” (emphasis added) 
11. 
Here, no such opposition has been filed. In fact, no opposition has been filed in response 
to any of the Respondent’s pleadings throughout this case by the opposing party. 
12. 
By ordering a motion for sanctions to be filed, the Court is advocating on behalf of the 
Petitioner. The impartial line of reasoning would have been for the Court to order that a 
response be filed by the opposing party, not that a motion for sanctions be filed regarding 
motions that do not exist. 
13. 
For these reasons, the order entitled “ORDER RE MANDATORY SANCTIONS FOR 
THE FILING OF TERTIARY RECUSAL MOTION” must also be vacated. 
V. GROUNDS TO STRIKE PETITIONER’S MOTION FOR SANCTIONS AND 
REQUEST FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES 
 
14. 
The most troubling aspect of this case is that the alleged attorney for Petitioner, COOPER  
 
L. CARTER, continues to file fraudulent pleadings with this Court which have no basis in law or 
 
fact. Even if the non-existent motions did exist, COOPER L. CARTER’s motion is facially 
 
improper and her persistent incompetence is the crux of the issue within this case. 
 
15. 
This attorney had a pleading entitled “Motion for Sanctions and Request for Attorney’s  
 
Fees” filed on October 2, 2025, on her behalf by Roderick D. Marx, an individual not named in

IV. GROUNDS TO VACATE ORDER RE MANDATORY SANCTIONS FOR THE
FILING OF TERTIARY RECUSAL MOTION

10. The Court cannot order a party to file a motion for sanctions regarding 1) a motion that
was never filed and 2) a motion that was never opposed. The Court’s own order highlights this
when it cites to Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§ 30.016 (c), which states “4A judge hearing a
tertiary recusal motion against another judge who denies the motion shall award reasonable and
necessary attorney's fees and costs to the party opposing the motion.” (emphasis added)

11. Here, no such opposition has been filed. In fact, no opposition has been filed in response
to any of the Respondent’s pleadings throughout this case by the opposing party.

12. By ordering a motion for sanctions to be filed, the Court is advocating on behalf of the
Petitioner. The impartial line of reasoning would have been for the Court to order that a
response be filed by the opposing party, not that a motion for sanctions be filed regarding
motions that do not exist.

13. For these reasons, the order entitled “ORDER RE MANDATORY SANCTIONS FOR
THE FILING OF TERTIARY RECUSAL MOTION” must also be vacated.

V. GROUNDS TO STRIKE PETITIONER’S MOTION FOR SANCTIONS AND
REQUEST FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES

14. The most troubling aspect of this case is that the alleged attorney for Petitioner, COOPER
L. CARTER, continues to file fraudulent pleadings with this Court which have no basis in law or
fact. Even if the non-existent motions did exist, COOPER L. CARTER’s motion is facially
improper and her persistent incompetence is the crux of the issue within this case.

15. This attorney had a pleading entitled “Motion for Sanctions and Request for Attorney’s

Fees” filed on October 2, 2025, on her behalf by Roderick D. Marx, an individual not named in

this lawsuit. Cooper L. Carter has been under challenge pursuant to Rule 12 since September 20,  
 
2024, and has continued to defraud the Courts on multiple occasions with boilerplate motions  
 
that have no factual basis. This latest motion is no different. See Exhibit 6. 
 
16. 
In this motion, $10,000 in attorney’s fees are being requested for “several frivolous  
 
motions” to which she never provided a response to. This makes the motions unopposed, not  
 
frivolous. Cooper L. Carter is under the misconception that because she holds a license to  
 
practice law, she is free to violate it simply because the Respondent is representing himself. 
 
17. 
The record clearly shows that this attorney has not performed any duties normally  
 
expected of an attorney, and the $10,000 request for sanctions is yet another fraudulent  
 
misrepresentation made by this attorney. 
 
18.  
Notwithstanding the above, even if Cooper L. Carter had responded to the motion to  
 
recuse and performed legal work to justify $10,000 sanctions, her motion remains facially  
 
invalid, as per the Court’s order, exhibits were required to be attached. This further showcases 
 
that despite her status as a licensed attorney, her knowledge of the law is lacking, and she  
 
has no right to declare motions as “frivolous” when she hasn’t provided any response. 
 
19. 
These are not accidental errors. This is intentional misrepresentation for personal  
 
enrichment, and the impartial course of action for this Court would be to set a hearing on  
 
the motion to recuse which was actually filed and served rather than advocate on behalf of  
 
the non-participating party. 
 
20. 
Cooper L. Carter should be required to file a coherent response to these facts.

VI. CONCLUSION 
 
21.  
The Court continues to adjudicate motions which were never filed, continues exhibit  
 
Favoritism towards the Petitioner, and went so far as to order one side of the case to ask for  
 
Sanctions on a motion that does not exist and to which she did not respond to. 
 
22. 
These errors are not superficial – they strike at the heart of due process and have made a  
 
mockery of these proceedings. There is no evidence anyone is even reading the Respondent’s  
 
pleadings, yet feels entitled to label them as “frivolous”. There is no evidence that the original 
 
recusal motion was ever referred to the Court.  
 
23. 
There is clear misconduct occurring in this case, and Respondent reserves the right to 
 
file a response to a coherent, fact-based motion for sanctions with the required exhibits once 
 
a proper response is submitted. 
 
24. 
The Court cannot continue to retaliate, as it has done here, against the Respondent  
 
without any legal basis. His self-represented status does not permit the opposing attorney to  
 
conduct her  duties incompetently, and does not give the Court justification to intentionally  
 
misapply the law  and advocate on behalf of the other side. 
 
25. 
Respondent’s legal position is correct absent any response or a coherent order, relief is  
 
warranted, and the orders issued on September 26, 2025, must be vacated, the clear  
 
frivolous Motion for Sanctions and Request for Attorney’s Fees must be stricken, and a hearing  
 
on the correct motion to recuse should be scheduled at the earliest opportunity for the reasons  
 
stated above.

AND 
ORDER RE MANDATORY SANCTIONS FOR THE FILING OF 
TERTIARY RECUSAL MOTION 
Before me is a pleading entitled Motion to Recuse Associate Judge Kaitcer filed by 
Charles Dustin Myers. 
This motion was referred to me after Associate Judge Jeff Kaitcer 
declined to recuse himself by order dated September 9, 2025. 
Mr. Myers has filed three or more motions to recuse and/or disqualify judges in this case. 
When a party files his third motion to recuse in a case, the judge(s) must move the case to final 
disposition as though a tertiary recusal motion had not been filed. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code 
§ 30.016 (b) (3); Gonzalez v. Guilbot, 315 S.W.3d 533 (Tex. 2010). That is, once a tertiary 
motion to recuse is filed, the judges assigned to the case are required to proceed and cannot delay 
the case because of the filing of a motion to recuse. 
Further, sanctions are mandatory if a tertiary recusal motion is denied. Tex. Civ. Prac. & 
Rem. Code§ 30.016 (c), which provides as follows: 
A judge hearing a tertiary recusal motion against another judge who denies the motion 
shall award reasonable and necessary attorney's fees and costs to the party opposing the motion. 
The party making the motion and the attorney for the party are jointly and severally liable for 
the award of fees and costs. The fees and costs must be paid before the 31st day after the date the 
order denying the tertiary recusal motion is rendered, unless the order is properly superseded.

ORDER SUMMARILY DENYING MOTION TO RECUSE
AND
ORDER DIRECTING THE CASE TO PROCEED TO TRIAL PURSUANT TO
TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 30.016
AND
ORDER RE MANDATORY SANCTIONS FOR THE FILING OF
TERTIARY RECUSAL MOTION

Before me is a pleading entitled Motion to Recuse Associate Judge Kaitcer filed by
Charles Dustin Myers. This motion was referred to me after Associate Judge Jeff Kaitcer
declined to recuse himself by order dated September 9, 2025.

Mr. Myers has filed three or more motions to recuse and/or disqualify judges in this case.
When a party files his third motion to recuse in a case, the judge(s) must move the case to final
disposition as though a tertiary recusal motion had not been filed. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code
§ 30.016 (b) (3); Gonzalez v. Guilbot, 315 S.W.3d 533 (Tex. 2010). That is, once a tertiary
motion to recuse is filed, the judges assigned to the case are required to proceed and cannot delay
the case because of the filing of a motion to recuse.

Further, sanctions are mandatory if a tertiary recusal motion is denied. Tex. Civ. Prac. &
Rem. Code § 30.016 (c), which provides as follows:

A judge hearing a tertiary recusal motion against another judge who denies the motion
shall award reasonable and necessary attorney's fees and costs to the party opposing the motion.
The party making the motion and the attorney for the party are jointly and severally liable for
the award of fees and costs. The fees and costs must be paid before the 31st day after the date the

order denying the tertiary recusal motion is rendered, unless the order is properly superseded.

I have reviewed the motion as to Associate Judge Kaitcer and the motion fails to meet the 
requirements of Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 18a(a) because it does not state with detail and 
particularity admissible facts that would justify recusal or disqualification if proven. Tex. R. Civ. 
P. 18a(a)(4). 
IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED THAT: 
1. The motion to recuse is denied as to Associate Judge Kaitcer without hearing Tex. 
R. Civ. P l 8a(g)(3)(A), (i). 
2. All judges in this case will comply with Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 30.016 
(b) (3) requiring judges to move the case to final disposition as though a tertiary 
recusal motion had not been filed. 
3. The issue of the mandatory sanctions required by Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§ 
30.016 (c) will be handled as follows: 
a. The parties entitled to sanctions will file on or before October 3, 2025, a 
motion for sanctions with exhibits showing reasonable and necessary 
attorney's fees and cost attached to the motion. 
b. Mr. Myers will file his response to the sanctions by October 10, 2025. 
c. The motion for sanctions will be taken up on written submission on 
October 17, 2025. 
4. This order only addresses the motion to recuse Associate Judge Kaitcer and the 
issues raised by the tertiary recusal motion.

TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THIS COURT:

However, I urge this court to pay close attention for the forthcoming reasons:

*All docket references herein are market with DKT followed by the corresponding number. 
 
3. Respondent, on day one, was divested of his property, his children, and his normal 
place of business. DKT 19.  
 
4. The Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, was allowed to approach this Court, submit 
facially fraudulent pleadings, and walk away with full custody and sole use of the residency 
before anything was ever adjudicated. She was permitted to falsify her indigency, claim abuse, 
and fabricate an emergency when the record before this court has held the truth, and remains 
unopposed. DKT 1, 3, 5 & 27.  
 
5. The Respondent has provided this Court, the Second Court of Appeals, the Texas 
Supreme Court, the State Commission on Judicial Conduct, the State Bar of Texas, and the 
Office of the Attorney General with every possible opportunity to correct this situation, and each 
body has refused to do so. He has not received one argument, not one explanation, and not one 
justification for what has transpired. DKT passim. 
 
6. Now, while the reviewer may pause here and claim this motion is meritless, the reality 
of this situation is that after careful review of the record, the fact pattern of this case, and after 
receiving not a single response in any of the six appellate cases from any implicated judge on 
appeal, and with zero sum participation from the other side of the table, the record facially 
establishes that Honorable James Munford, Honorable Jeff Kaitcer, Court Coordinator Lindsey 
Baker, opposing attorney Cooper L. Carter, and Petitioner Morgan Michelle Myers, collectively, 
have exhbited conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. 
 
7. Accordingly, absent any swift corrective action, Honorable James Munford must 
recuse himself from this matter, which is supported by the forthcoming facts found in the record:

II. RECUSAL STANDARDS AND PROCEDURE 
 
8. Texas appellate courts have consistently held that recusal is mandatory—not 
discretionary—when a judge’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned (Ex parte Thuesen, 
546 S.W.3d 145 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017)). The test is whether a reasonable member of the public, 
knowing all the facts, would have a reasonable doubt about the judge’s impartiality (Rodriguez v. 
Newton, NUMBER 13-19-00309-CV (Tex. App. Jul 16, 2020); In re Moore, NUMBER 13-19-
00551-CV (Tex. App. Oct 30, 2019); Johnson-Todd v. Morgan, NO. 09-17-00168-CV, NO. 09-
17-00194-CV (Tex. App. Dec 20, 2018); Kniatt v. State, 239 S.W.3d 910 (Tex. App. 2007); Sears 
v. Nueces County Sherriff Olivarez, 28 S.W.3d 611 (Tex. App. 2000)). This standard is applied 
regardless of whether actual bias exists; the appearance of bias is sufficient. 
 
9. When a recusal motion is filed, the judge must either recuse themselves or refer the 
motion to another judge for decision; the challenged judge cannot unilaterally determine the 
sufficiency of the allegations (De Leon v. Aguilar, 127 S.W.3d 1 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004)). 
 
10. A federal lawsuit against a judge, particularly one alleging conspiracy with a party in 
a RICO action, creates an immediate and substantial conflict of interest that requires the judge’s 
prompt recusal from presiding over this matter, because the judge’s impartiality would 
reasonably be questioned under both constitutional and statutory standards. The integrity of the 
judicial process and the appearance of fairness demand recusal in such circumstances to preserve 
public confidence and due process, which has already been tainted by these proceedings. 
 
11. The Texas Constitution provides a foundational rule: no judge may preside over a 
case in which they have an interest, or where there is a connection to the parties by affinity, 
consanguinity, or prior involvement as counsel (Tex. Const. art. 5 § 11). This constitutional 
mandate is echoed and elaborated in the Texas Government Code, which requires a judge to

recuse themselves and request assignment of another judge if they are disqualified or should 
otherwise recuse (Tex. Gov't. Code § 24.002). The Texas Government Code also provides 
mechanisms for parties to object to a judge’s assignment in civil cases, including divorce, and 
mandates recusal upon timely objection (Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.053). 
 
12. Administrative regulations reinforce these requirements, specifying that a judge is 
subject to recusal or disqualification on the same grounds as set out in Texas Rule of Civil 
Procedure 18b, and that motions to recuse must be made promptly and supported by admissible 
facts (1 Tex. Admin. Code § 155.152). 
 
13. The law is clear that the appearance of impropriety is as damaging as actual 
impropriety. The Code of Judicial Conduct and the Texas Supreme Court have emphasized that 
judges must avoid situations where their impartiality might reasonably be questioned, as public 
confidence in the judiciary depends on the perception of fairness and neutrality (State v. 
Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft, 692 S.W.3d 467 (Tex. 2022); In re Moore, NUMBER 13-19-
00551-CV (Tex. App. Oct 30, 2019)). 
 
15. Allegations of conspiracy under RICO are not mere accusations of bias or error; they 
are claims of criminal conduct and collusion with a party. This elevates the conflict of interest to 
an extraordinary level, making it virtually impossible for the judge to preside without 
undermining the legitimacy of the proceedings. The public, and the parties, would have every 
reason to doubt the judge’s impartiality, and the law requires recusal in such circumstances 
(Rodriguez v. Cantu (In re Rodriguez), NUMBER 13-19-00230-CV, NUMBER 13-19-00254-CV 
(Tex. App. Jun 25, 2019); Johnson-Todd v. Morgan, NO. 09-17-00168-CV, NO. 09-17-00194-CV 
(Tex. App. Dec 20, 2018)). 
 
16. Absent corrective action, immediate recusal is warranted, supported by the following: 
--- OCR TEXT ---
recuse themselves and request assignment of another judge if they are disqualified or should
otherwise recuse (Tex. Gov't. Code § 24.002). The Texas Government Code also provides
mechanisms for parties to object to a judge’s assignment in civil cases, including divorce, and
mandates recusal upon timely objection (Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.053).

12. Administrative regulations reinforce these requirements, specifying that a judge is
subject to recusal or disqualification on the same grounds as set out in Texas Rule of Civil
Procedure 18b, and that motions to recuse must be made promptly and supported by admissible
facts (1 Tex. Admin. Code § 155.152).

III. GROUNDS FOR RECUSAL 
A. WIRE FRAUD 
 
8. On October 7, 2024, Respondent filed a joint motion to recuse District Judge James 
Munford and Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer through the electronic filing manager, serving all 
parties with one hyperlinked document containing all exhibits and notarized affidavits (DKT NO. 
227). This recusal was filed in good faith after all appellate efforts were denied without 
explanation. See Cause No. 24-0395. 
 
9. On October 8, 2024, at 4:43 PM, correspondence was received from Court Coordinator 
Lindsey Baker regarding an order of referral and ruling letter transmitted by District Judge James 
Munford to Regional Presiding Judge David L. Evans, declining to recuse himself from this 
matter (DKT NOS. 228-229). This email contained an unoriginal, modified version of the joint 
motion to recuse submitted to re:Search Texas by the Respondent, and was missing the exhibits 
and the affidavit.  
 
10. By CC’ing this email to coopercarter@majadmin.com on October 8, 2024, District 
Judge James Munford, through his court coordinator, relied on interstate wire communications 
because majadmin.com can be traced to the IP address 74.208.236.18, which IP Geolocation 
places in Kansas City, at coordinates 39.0997,-94.5786. Combined with the intentional alteration 
of the pleading to withhold material exhibits/affidavit to influence the recusal outcome, the 
transmission constitutes wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, thereby supplying a RICO predicate 
act under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), committed by both Lindsey Baker and District Judge James 
Munford. At minimum, these facts plausibly allege the interstate-wire and fraud elements of this 
claim are supported by admissible evidence, that if true, would warrant his immediate recusal, 
and no further involvement from the Court Coordinator absent any swift corrective action.

Il. GROUNDS FOR RECUSAL

B. WIRE FRAUD – COUNT TWO 
 
11. On October 10, 2024, court coordinator Lindsey Baker transmitted an “Amended 
Order of Referral” at 11:17 AM and a second judge’s ruling letter. (DKT 232, 233) This 
transmission relied on the same interstate wires mentioned above. 
 
12. The original motion was once again modified, this time split into three separate files 
“due to the size of the motion” which was well under the 35mb limit allotted from the efile Texas 
platform, with hyperlinks removed, affecting its’ readability. 
 
13. When Respondent pointed these issues out, Baker confirmed the pleading had been e-
filed and the full document was in the court's possession (DKT NOS. 230-231 see Exhibits) 
showing that there was no plausible reason to modify them. 
C. FAILURE TO FOLLOW MANDATORY RECUSAL PROCEDURES 
 
14. The primary legislative and regulatory authorities governing the handling of recusal 
motions in Texas are Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a and various provisions of the Texas 
Government Code, including sections 25.00256, 29.055, and 74.059(c)(3). 
 
15. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a sets out the exclusive procedure for recusal or 
disqualification of judges in civil cases. Upon the filing of a recusal motion, the rule requires the 
respondent judge, within three business days, to either recuse themselves or refer the motion to 
the regional presiding judge. The rule further mandates that the judge must take no further action 
in the case until the motion is resolved, except for good cause stated in writing or on the record. 
 
16. Texas Government Code § 25.00256 (and related provisions such as § 29.055 and § 
74.059(c)(3)) reinforce these requirements, specifying that the judge must forward the motion 
and all related documents in their original form or as certified copies to the presiding judge, and 
may not take further action in the case until the recusal motion is resolved.

17. Here, modified versions were transmitted, notably missing critical elements such as 
the notarized affidavit and exhibits showing a long list of misconduct that remains unaddressed 
to this day. Notwithstanding the federal allegations above, there is a continuous pattern showing 
that the law is being willfully disregarded by these individuals, and enabled by the Regional 
Presiding Judge, who has permitted rulings on non-existent motions, and the continued 
involvement of Baker despite clear ambiguities surrounding the prior two recusal proceedings. 
 
18. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a and Texas Government Code § 29.055 both require 
the forwarding of the motion and all related documents in their original or certified form. The use 
of the term “all” and the requirement for original or certified copies preclude any alteration, 
omission, or selective transmission. This is further reinforced by case law, which consistently 
holds that the judge’s only permissible actions are recusal or referral, and that any other action—
including any manipulation of the motion or its exhibits—is outside the scope of the judge’s 
authority (In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025); In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 
858 (Tex. App. 2006); Carson v. Gomez, 841 S.W.2d 491 (Tex. App. 1992)). 
IV. ETHICS 
 
 
19. The ethical consequences of the allegations are significant. The Texas Code of 
Judicial Conduct requires judges to comply with the law and maintain professional competence. 
In In re Inquiry Concerning Honorable Bonnie Rangel (677 S.W.3d 918, Tex. 2023), the Texas 
Supreme Court publicly admonished a judge for filing a response to a recusal motion, which is 
expressly prohibited by Rule 18a. The Court found that this single act demonstrated a lack of 
competence in the law and a failure to comply with legal requirements, violating Canons 2A and 
3B(2).

20. By analogy, in this case, a staff member who serves at the pleasure of the Judge
facing recusal was permitted to transmit non-original copies a government document through the 
use of interstate wires when the law clearly prohibits such behavior. 
21. Furthermore, these actions are not isolated but build upon a growing pattern of
misconduct in furtherance of a broader scheme initiated by Petitioner Morgan Michelle Myers. 
V. PURSUIT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS
22. The actions alleged herein are part of a larger, broader scheme to defraud the
Respondent of his business and property, and this Recusal serves as both a notice to any 
individual reading this brief that the law is not optional. Whether  a judge, an attorney, a clerk, or 
a coordinator – the law is not below you.  
23. In this case, several individuals have chosen to disregard the law, put their political
interests and bias before the Children and laws of this State, and have inadvertently assisted the 
Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, in an elaborate scheme to defraud the Respondent of 
business and property of which affects interstate commerce currently being litigated in the 
Western District of Oklahoma. 
VI. CONCLUSION
24. For these reasons, Judge James Munford should be immediately recused, or in the
alternative, correct the mistakes that have remained unaddressed for two years and remain 
unopposed on the face of the record.  
25. The record is clear: this is a one sided case, with a one sided outcome, and despite
having every reason to correct the errors in the face of no opposition, this Court has chosen to 
disregard the law, ethical standards, and has committed several predicate acts in the process 
which will be outlined in more detail if the subsequent federal action must be brought.

AFFIDAVIT OF CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS  
COUNTY OF TARRANT 
 
BEFORE ME, the undersigned authority, on this day Charles Dustin Myers personally appeared, 
who, being by me duly sworn, deposed as follows: 
 
1. My name is Charles Dustin Myers. I am over the age of eighteen, of sound mind, and 
competent to make this affidavit. The facts stated herein are within my personal 
knowledge and are true and correct. 
 
2. On October 7, 2024, I filed a joint motion to recuse District Judge James Munford and 
Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer through the electronic filing manager, serving all parties 
with a single document containing all exhibits and a notarized affidavit. 
 
3. On October 8, 2024, I received correspondence from Court Coordinator Lindsey Baker 
regarding an order of referral and ruling letter transmitted by Judge Munford to Regional 
Presiding Judge David L. Evans. The email contained a modified version of my joint 
motion to recuse, which was missing the exhibits and affidavit that I had originally 
submitted. 
 
4. On October 10, 2024, Ms. Baker transmitted an “Amended Order of Referral” and a 
second judge’s ruling letter. The original motion was again modified, split into three 
separate files, and hyperlinks were removed, affecting its readability. The size of the 
original document was well under the 35MB limit for e-filing. 
 
5. When I raised these issues with Ms. Baker, she confirmed that the full document was in 
the court’s possession, and there was no plausible reason for the modifications. 
 
6. I believe that these actions, including the alteration and selective transmission of my 
filings, have affected the integrity of the recusal process and raise reasonable questions 
about the impartiality of Judge Munford in this case and are based on my personal 
knowledge and believe, and is supported by admissible evidence on the face of the 
record. 
 
7. Based on personal knowledge and belief, these actions are part of a larger criminal 
enterprise including Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer, Court Coordinator Lindsey Baker, 
Cooper Carter, and Morgan Michelle Myers which will be pursued in Federal Court.

I. INTRODUCTION 
1. There exists no excuse, nor any law or reasoning that could justify the events that have 
transpired throughout this case. Respondent notes that this is the third recusal motion filed in this 
matter, making it a tertiary recusal pursuant to Tex. Gov't. Code§ 25.00256. The term includes 
any third or subsequent motion filed in the case by the same party, regardless of whether that 
motion is filed against a different judge than the judge or judges against whom the previous 
motions for recusal or disqualification were filed. 
2. In practice, and pursuant to the statute, this gives Honorable James Munford the ability 
to move the case to final disposition as though a tertiary recusal motion had not been filed. 
However, I urge this court to pay close attention for the forthcoming reasons:

I. INTRODUCTION
1. There exists no excuse, nor any law or reasoning that could justify the events that have

*All docket references herein are market with DKT followed by the corresponding number. 
3. Respondent, on day one, was divested of his property, his children, and his normal 
place ofbusiness. DKT 19. 
4. The Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, was allowed to approach this Court, submit 
facially fraudulent pleadings, and walk away with full custody and sole use of the residency 
before anything was ever adjudicated. She was permitted to falsify her indigency, claim abuse, 
and fabricate an emergency when the record before this court has held the truth, and remains 
unopposed. DKT 1, 3, 5 & 27. 
5. The Respondent has provided this Court, the Second Court of Appeals, the Texas 
Supreme Court, the State Commission on Judicial Conduct, the State Bar of Texas, and the 
Office of the Attorney General with every possible opportunity to correct this situation, and each 
body has refused to do so. He has not received one argument, not one explanation, and not one 
justification for what has transpired. DKT passim. 
6. Now, while the reviewer may pause here and claim this motion is meritless, the reality 
of this situation is that after careful review of the record, the fact pattern of this case, and after 
receiving not a single response in any of the six appellate cases from any implicated judge on 
appeal, and with zero sum participation from the other side of the table, the record facially 
establishes that Honorable James Munford, Honorable JeffKaitcer, Court Coordinator Lindsey 
Baker, opposing attorney Cooper L. Carter, and Petitioner Morgan Michelle Myers, collectively, 
have exhbited conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. 
7. Accordingly, absent any swift corrective action, Honorable James Munford must 
recuse himself from this matter, which is supported by the forthcoming facts found in the record:

II. RECUSAL STANDARDS AND PROCEDURE 
8. Texas appellate courts have consistently held that recusal is mandatory-not 
discretionary-when a judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned (Ex parte Thuesen, 
546 S.W.3d 145 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017)). The test is whether a reasonable member of the public, 
knowing all the facts, would have a reasonable doubt about the judge's impartiality (Rodriguez v. 
Newton, NUMBER 13-19-00309-CV (Tex. App. Jul 16, 2020); In re Moore, NUMBER 13-19-
00551-CV (Tex. App. Oct 30, 2019); Johnson-Todd v. Morgan, NO. 09-17-00168-CV, NO. 09-
17-00194-CV (Tex. App. Dec 20, 2018); Kniatt v. State, 239 S.W.3d 910 (Tex. App. 2007); Sears 
I 
v. Nueces County SherriffOlivarez, 28 S.W.3d 611 (Tex. App. 2000)). This standard is applied 
regardless of whether actual bias exists; the appearance of bias is sufficient. 
9. When a recusal motion is filed, the judge must either recuse themselves or refer the 
motion to another judge for decision; the challenged judge cannot unilaterally determine the 
sufficiency of the allegations (De Leon v. Aguilar, 127 S.W.3d 1 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004)). 
10. A federal lawsuit against a judge, particularly one alleging conspiracy with a party in 
a RICO action, creates an immediate and substantial conflict of interest that requires the judge's 
prompt recusal from presiding over this matter, because the judge's impartiality would 
reasonably be questioned under both constitutional and statutory standards. The integrity of the 
judicial process and the appearance of fairness demand recusal in such circumstances to preserve 
public confidence and due process, which has already been tainted by these proceedings. 
11. The Texas Constitution provides a foundational rule: no judge may preside over a 
case in which they have an interest, or where there is a connection to the parties by affinity, 
consanguinity, or prior involvement as counsel (Tex. Const. art. 5 § 11 ). This constitutional 
mandate is echoed and elaborated in the Texas Government Code, which requires a judge to

II. RECUSAL STANDARDS AND PROCEDURE

8. Texas appellate courts have consistently held that recusal is mandatory—not
discretionary—when a judge’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned (Ex parte Thuesen,
546 §.W.3d 145 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017)). The test is whether a reasonable member of the public,
knowing all the facts, would have a reasonable doubt about the judge’s impartiality (Rodriguez v.
Newton, NUMBER 13-19-00309-CV (Tex. App. Jul 16, 2020); In re Moore, NUMBER 13-19-
00551-CV (Tex. App. Oct 30, 2019); Johnson-Todd v. Morgan, NO. 09-17-00168-CV, NO. 09-
17-00194-CV (Tex. App. Dec 20, 2018); Kniatt v. State, 239 §.W.3d 910 (Tex. App. 2007); Sears
v. Nueces County Sherriff Olivarez, 28 S.W.3d 611 (Tex. App. 2000)). This standard is applied
regardless of whether actual bias exists; the appearance of bias is sufficient.

9. When a recusal motion is filed, the judge must either recuse themselves or refer the
motion to another judge for decision; the challenged judge cannot unilaterally determine the
sufficiency of the allegations (De Leon v, Aguilar, 127 8.W.3d 1 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004)).

10. A federal lawsuit against a judge, particularly one alleging conspiracy with a party in
a RICO action, creates an immediate and substantial conflict of interest that requires the judge’s
prompt recusal from presiding over this matter, because the judge’s impartiality would

case in which they have an interest, or where there is a connection to the parties by affinity,
consanguinity, or prior involvement as counsel (Tex. Const. art. 5 § 11). This constitutional

mandate is echoed and elaborated in the Texas Government Code, which requires a judge to

=== PAGE 38 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
recuse themselves and request assignment of another judge if they are disqualified or should 
otherwise recuse (Tex. Gov't. Code § 24.002). The Texas Government Code also provides 
mechanisms for parties to object to a judge's assignment in civil cases, including divorce, and 
mandates recusal upon timely objection (Tex. Gov't. Code§ 74.053). 
12. Administrative regulations reinforce these requirements, specifying that a judge is 
subject to recusal or disqualification on the same grounds as set out in Texas Rule of Civil 
Procedure 18b, and that motions to recuse must be made promptly and supported by admissible 
facts (1 Tex. Admin. Code§ 155.152). 
13. The law is clear that the appearance of impropriety is as damaging as actual 
impropriety. The Code of Judicial Conduct and the Texas Supreme Court have emphasized that 
judges must avoid situations where their impartiality might reasonably be questioned, as public 
confidence in the judiciary depends on the perception of fairness and neutrality (State v. 
Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft, 692 S. W.3d 467 (Tex. 2022); In re Moore, NUMBER 13-19-
00551-CV (Tex. App. Oct 30, 2019)). 
15. Allegations of conspiracy under RICO are not mere accusations of bias or error; they 
are claims of criminal conduct and collusion with a party. This elevates the conflict of interest to 
an extraordinary level, making it virtually impossible for the judge to preside without 
undermining the legitimacy of the proceedings. The public, and the parties, would have every 
reason to doubt the judge's impartiality, and the law requires recusal in such circumstances 
(Rodriguez v. Cantu (In re Rodriguez), NUMBER 13-19-00230-CV, NUMBER 13-19-00254-CV 
(Tex. App. Jun 25, 2019); Johnson-Toddv. Morgan, NO. 09-17-00168-CV, NO. 09-17-00194-CV 
(Tex. App. Dec 20, 2018)).

III. GROUNDS FOR RECUSAL 
A. WIRE FRAUD 
8. On October 7, 2024, Respondent filed a joint motion to recuse District Judge James 
Munford and Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer through the electronic filing manager, serving all 
parties with one hyperlinked document containing all exhibits and notarized affidavits (DKT NO. 
227). This recusal was filed in good faith after all appellate efforts were denied without 
explanation. See Cause No. 24-0395. 
9. On October 8, 2024, at 4:43 PM, correspondence was received from Court Coordinator 
Lindsey Baker regarding an order of referral and ruling letter transmitted by District Judge James 
Munford to Regional Presiding Judge David L. Evans, declining to recuse himself from this 
matter (DKT NOS. 228-229). This email contained an unoriginal, modified version of the joint 
motion to recuse submitted to re:Search Texas by the Respondent, and was missing the exhibits 
and the affidavit. 
10. By CC'ing this email to coopercarter@majadmin.com on October 8, 2024, District 
Judge James Munford, through his court coordinator, relied on interstate wire communications 
because majadmin.com can be traced to the IP address 74.208.236.18, which IP Geolocation 
places in Kansas City, at coordinates 39.0997,-94.5786. Combined with the intentional alteration 
of the pleading to withhold material exhibits/affidavit to influence the recusal outcome, the 
transmission constitutes wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, thereby supplying a RICO predicate 
act under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), committed by both Lindsey Baker and District Judge James 
Munford. At minimum, these facts plausibly allege the interstate-wire and fraud elements of this 
claim are supported by admissible evidence, that if true, would warrant his immediate recusal, 
and no further involvement from the Court Coordinator absent any swift corrective action.

B. WIRE FRAUD - COUNT TWO 
11. On October 10, 2024, court coordinator Lindsey Baker transmitted an "Amended 
Order of Referral" at 11: 17 AM and a second judge's ruling letter. (DKT 232, 233) This 
transmission relied on the same interstate wires mentioned above. 
12. The original motion was once again modified, this time split into three separate files 
"due to the size of the motion" which was well under the 35mb limit allotted from the efile Texas 
platform, with hyperlinks removed, affecting its' readability. 
13. When Respondent pointed these issues out, Baker confirmed the pleading had been e-
filed and the full document was in the court's possession (DKT NOS. 230-231 see Exhibits) 
showing that there was no plausible reason to modify them. 
C. FAILURE TO FOLLOW MANDATORY RECUSAL PROCEDURES 
14. The primary legislative and regulatory authorities governing the handling of recusal 
motions in Texas are Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a and various provisions of the Texas 
Government Code, including sections 25.00256, 29.055, and 74.059(c)(3). 
15. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a sets out the exclusive procedure for recusal or 
disqualification of judges in civil cases. Upon the filing of a recusal motion, the rule requires the 
respondent judge, within three business days, to either recuse themselves or refer the motion to 
the regional presiding judge. The rule further mandates that the judge must take no further action 
in the case until the motion is resolved, except for good cause stated in writing or on the record. 
16. Texas Government Code§ 25.00256 (and related provisions such as§ 29.055 and§ 
74.059(c)(3)) reinforce these requirements, specifying that the judge must forward the motion 
and all related documents in their original form or as certified copies to the presiding judge, and 
may not take further action in the case until the recusal motion is resolved.

the notarized affidavit and exhibits showing a long list of misconduct that remains unaddressed 
to this day. Notwithstanding the federal allegations above, there is a continuous pattern showing 
that the law is being willfully disregarded by these individuals, and enabled by the Regional 
Presiding Judge, who has permitted rulings on non-existent motions, and the continued 
involvement of Baker despite clear ambiguities surrounding the prior two recusal proceedings. 
18. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a and Texas Government Code§ 29.055 both require 
the forwarding of the motion and all related documents in their original or certified form. The use 
of the term "all" and the requirement for original or certified copies preclude any alteration, 
omission, or selective transmission. This is further reinforced by case law, which consistently 
holds that the judge's only permissible actions ·are recusal or referral, and that any other action-
including any manipulation of the motion or its exhibits-is outside the scope of the judge's 
authority (In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025); In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 
858 (Tex. App. 2006); Carson v. Gomez, 841 S.W.2d 491 (Tex. App. 1992)).

Judicial Conduct requires judges to comply with the law and maintain professional competence. 
In In re Inquiry Concerning Honorable Bonnie Rangel (677 S.W.3d 918, Tex. 2023), the Texas 
Supreme Court publicly admonished a judge for filing a response to a recusal moti_on, which is 
expressly prohibited by Rule 18a. The Court found that this single act demonstrated a lack of 
competence in the law and a failure to comply with legal requirements, violating Canons 2A and 
3B(2).

20. By analogy, in this case, a staff member who serves at the pleasure of the Judge 
facing recusal was permitted to transmit non-original copies a government document through the 
use of interstate wires when the law clearly prohibits such behavior. 
21. Furthermore, these actions are not isolated but build upon a growing pattern of 
misconduct in furtherance of a broader scheme initiated by Petitioner Morgan Michelle Myers. 
V. PURSUIT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS 
22. The actions alleged herein are part of a larger, broader scheme to defraud the 
Respondent of his business and property, and this Recusal serves as both a notice to any 
individual reading this brief that the law is not optional. Whether a judge, an attorney, a clerk, or 
a coordinator - the law is not below you. 
23. In this case, several individuals have chosen to disregard the law, put their political 
interests and bias before the Children and laws of this State, and have inadvertently assisted the 
Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, in an elaborate scheme to defraud the Respondent of 
business and property of which affects interstate commerce currently being litigated in the 
Western District of Oklahoma. 
VI. CONCLUSION 
24. For these reasons, Judge James Munford should be immediately recused, or in the 
alternative, correct the mistakes that have remained unaddressed for two years and remain 
unopposed on the face of the record. 
25. The record is clear: this is a one sided case, with a one sided outcome, and despite 
having every reason to correct the errors in the face of no opposition, this Court has chosen to 
disregard the law, ethical standards, and has committed several predicate acts in the process 
which will be outlined in more detail if the subsequent federal action must be brought.

AFFIDAVIT OF CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS 
COUNTY OF TARRANT 
BEFORE ME, the undersigned authority, on this day Charles Dustin Myers personally appeared, 
who, being by me duly sworn, deposed as follows: 
1. My name is Charles Dustin Myers. I am over the age of eighteen, of sound mind, and 
competent to make this affidavit. The facts stated herein are within my personal 
knowledge and are true and correct. 
2. On October 7, 2024, I filed a joint motion to recuse District Judge James Munford and 
Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer through the electronic filing manager, serving all parties 
with a single document containing all exhibits and a notarized affidavit. 
3. On October 8, 2024, I received correspondence from Court Coordinator Lindsey Baker 
regarding an order ofreferral and ruling letter transmitted by Judge Munford to Regional 
Presiding Judge David L. Evans. The email contained a modified version ofmy joint 
motion to recuse, which was missing the exhibits and affidavit that I had originally 
submitted. 
4. On October 10, 2024, Ms. Baker transmitted an "Amended Order of Referral" and a 
second judge's ruling letter. The original motion was again modified, split into three 
separate files, and hyperlinks were removed, affecting its readability. The size of the 
original document was well under the 35MB limit fore-filing. 
5. When I raised these issues with Ms. Baker, she confirmed that the full document was in 
the court's possession, and there was no plausible reason for the modifications. 
6. I believe that these actions, including the alteration and selective transmission ofmy 
filings, have affected the integrity of the recusal process and raise reasonable questions 
about the impartiality of Judge Munford in this case and are based on my personal 
knowledge and believe, and is supported by admissible evidence on the face of the 
record. 
7. Based on personal knowledge and belief, these actions are part of a larger criminal

AFFIDAVIT OF CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS
COUNTY OF TARRANT

BEFORE ME, the undersigned authority, on this day Charles Dustin Myers personally appeared,
who, being by me duly sworn, deposed as follows:

1.

My name is Charles Dustin Myers. I am over the age of eighteen, of sound mind, and
competent to make this affidavit. The facts stated herein are within my personal
knowledge and are true and correct.

On October 7, 2024, I filed a joint motion to recuse District Judge James Munford and
Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer through the electronic filing manager, serving all parties
with a single document containing all exhibits and a notarized affidavit.

On October 8, 2024, I received correspondence from Court Coordinator Lindsey Baker
regarding an order of referral and ruling letter transmitted by Judge Munford to Regional
Presiding Judge David L. Evans. The email contained a modified version of my joint
motion to recuse, which was missing the exhibits and affidavit that I had originally
submitted.

On October 10, 2024, Ms. Baker transmitted an “Amended Order of Referral” and a
second judge’s ruling letter. The original motion was again modified, split into three
separate files, and hyperlinks were removed, affecting its readability. The size of the
original document was well under the 35MB limit for e-filing. .

When I raised these issues with Ms. Baker, she confirmed that the full document was in
the court’s possession, and there was no plausible reason for the modifications.

" about the impartiality of Judge Munford in this case and are based on my personal

knowledge and believe, and is supported by admissible evidence on the face of the
record.

Based on personal knowledge and belief, these actions are part of a larger criminal

enterprise including Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer, Court Coordinator Lindsey Baker,
