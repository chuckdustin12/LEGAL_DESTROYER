TO THE HONORABLE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS:

Relator CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS (“Myers”) respectfully submits this
second amended motion for rehearing to bring forth new information that
compounds the issues in the trial courts below. Rather than addressing the
substantive issues raised across all five mandamus petitions here, the court below
continues to act ultra-vires and in a manner that threatens public confidence of the
judiciary. Despite non-prosecution for 18 months, the court below continues to

I. Summary
1. Under Texas law, a district judge who is the subject of a recusal motion
may not resume jurisdiction or issue substantive orders until a formal order of 
reinstatement is issued by the Regional Presiding Judge; any orders made before 
such reinstatement are void and without legal effect. The failure to follow these 
mandatory procedures constitutes a fundamental jurisdictional defect that warrants 
extraordinary relief. 
2. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a and related case law establish a strict,
mandatory process for handling judicial recusal motions. When a recusal motion is 
filed, the judge must either recuse themselves or refer the motion to the regional 
presiding judge, and may take no further action in the case until the motion is 
resolved and, if denied, until a formal order of reinstatement is issued; any orders 
issued in violation of these requirements are void ab initio. 
3. In the present scenario, the district judge’s issuance of an order setting the
underlying matter for final trial without a reinstatement order from the Regional 
Presiding Judge is ultra vires and void for lack of jurisdiction. (Exhibit 1) Texas 
courts have consistently held that such procedural and jurisdictional defects are not 
mere technicalities but go to the heart of due process and judicial authority, and 
that extraordinary relief is appropriate to remedy such fundamental errors and 
uphold public confidence in the Texas judiciary.

II. Background and Relevant Law 
 
4. The primary legislative authority governing judicial recusal in Texas is 
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, which sets forth the procedures and limitations 
on judicial action when a recusal motion is filed. Under Rule 18a(f), when a 
motion to recuse is filed, the judge must either recuse themselves or refer the 
motion to the regional presiding judge within three business days. Critically, the 
judge is prohibited from taking any further action in the case until the motion is 
resolved, except for good cause stated in writing or on the record. If the motion is 
denied, the judge may not resume jurisdiction until the Regional Presiding Judge 
issues a written order of reinstatement. 
 
5. This framework is reinforced by the Texas Government Code, which 
requires that, upon recusal or the filing of a recusal motion, the judge must request 
the presiding judge of the administrative judicial region to assign another judge to 
the case and take no further action except for good cause stated in the order. See 
Tex. Gov't. Code § 24.002. 
III. Jurisprudence 
 
6. Texas appellate courts have repeatedly and consistently interpreted Rule 
18a as imposing strict, mandatory requirements on judges subject to recusal 
motions. The authorities are uniform in holding that:

vires and void ab initio. Ex parte Thuesen, 546 S.W.3d 145 (Tex. 
Crim. App. 2017). 
IV. Analysis
7. Mandamus relief is appropriate where a trial court issues orders beyond its
jurisdiction or fails to comply with mandatory procedural requirements. In re 
Alpert, 276 S.W.3d 592 (Tex. App. 2008) and In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. 
App. 2006) both recognize that mandamus may issue to compel a judge to act on 
pending motions or to set aside void orders issued without proper authority. 
8. Here, Honorable John H. Cayce, respondent in this matter, remains active,
and no official reinstatement has been issued by the Regional Presiding Judge. 
9. Orders issued by a district judge after a motion to recuse has been filed,
and before a written order of reinstatement by the Regional Presiding Judge, are 
void ab initio under Texas law. The judge lacks jurisdiction to act in the case 
during this period, and any such orders must be set aside. 
10. Texas jurisprudence makes clear that such violations are not mere
technicalities but go to the heart of the judge’s jurisdiction. In Ex parte Thuesen, 
546 S.W.3d 145 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017), the court held that any orders issued by a 
judge after recusal, and before a written order of reinstatement, are void. The court 
emphasized that only a formal, written order by the regional presiding judge can 
restore judicial authority, and that oral or informal communications are insufficient.

11. The rationale for this strict approach is to preserve the integrity and 
impartiality of the judiciary and to ensure that parties are not subject to the 
authority of a judge whose impartiality has been called into question. The 
mandatory nature of the procedural requirements means that any deviation results 
in a fundamental jurisdictional defect, rendering any orders issued during the 
period of noncompliance void ab initio. 
 
12. Because the orders are void, parties are entitled to seek mandamus relief 
to set aside the void orders and to compel compliance with the procedural 
requirements. In re Smale, NO. 12-19-00372-CV (Tex. App. Apr 30, 2020); In re 
Amir-Sharif, NUMBER 13-19-00573-CV (Tex. App. Dec 12, 2019)). The courts 
have granted such relief in numerous cases, recognizing that the failure to follow 
the mandatory procedures constitutes a fundamental jurisdictional defect that 
cannot be cured by subsequent action. 
 
13. In the present matter, the failure to comply with the mandatory 
procedures requires that rehearing be granted to prevent further error. Any orders 
issued by the judge during the period of noncompliance must be vacated, and the 
case must be restored to the position it was in immediately following the filing of 
the recusal motion.

V. Conclusion
Texas law is clear: once a motion to recuse is filed, the district judge must 
either recuse themselves or refer the motion to the regional presiding judge and 
must not take further action in the case until the motion is resolved and, if denied, 
until a written order of reinstatement is issued. Any orders issued by the judge in 
violation of these requirements are void ab initio, as the judge acts without 
jurisdiction during this period. This rule is firmly established in both statutory law 
and a long line of Texas appellate and supreme court decisions, including Ex parte 
Thuesen, 546 S.W.3d 145 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017) and In re Burcham, NO. 12-18-
00008-CV (Tex. App. Jan 24, 2018). The failure to follow these mandatory 
procedures constitutes a fundamental jurisdictional defect, requiring that any 
orders issued during the period of noncompliance be set aside and that rehearing be 
granted to prevent further error now rather than wait for more inevitable appeals to 
surface.

322nd District Court's Policy for Trials and Hearings Concerning Evidence 
Presented to the Court, Effective September 1, 2023 
The 322nd District Court is updating its policy for Final Trials, Temporary Hearings and Hearings wherein written 
evidence will be presented. 
If a case is set for final trial or a hearing before the District Judge, the Court requests that all documentary exhibits 
be marked and copied in PDF format to an original USB drive. All videos, audios, etc. shall also be copied to the USB drive 
in a universal format for Windows Media Player. 
In addition, the marked "original" paper exhibits, the basis of the exhibits found on the USB, shall be delivered to 
the Court Reporter's office in a three-ring binder trial notebook. The District Judge does not want a three-ring binder trial 
notebook, the USB drive is sufficient. 
All exhibits and the USB drive shall be delivered to the Court Reporter at least 48 hours in 
advance of a trial or hearing. The opposing side is entitled to a paper copy of the exhibits at least 
48 hours prior to a trial or hearing. Failure to receive a copy is not grounds to continue a case. 
The exhibits should be numbered rather than identified alphabetically. The USB when opened, should have a 
labeled folder, for example, Petitioner's Custody Exhibits and/ or Petitioner's Property Exhibits. When the folder is opened, 
the exhibits should state the exhibit number and identify the exhibit. For example, Exhibit 1-Proposed Parenting Plan.

the Court Reporter's office in a three-ring binder trial notebook. The District Judge does not want a three-ring binder trial
notebook, the USB drive is sufficient.

All exhibits and the USB drive shall be delivered to the Court Reporter at least 48 hours in
advance of a trial or hearing. The opposing side is entitled to a paper copy of the exhibits at least
48 hours prior to a trial or hearing. Failure to receive a copy is not grounds to continue a case.

The exhibits should be numbered rather than identified alphabetically. The USB when opened, should have a
labeled folder, for example, Petitioner’s Custody Exhibits and/or Petitioner’s Property Exhibits. When the folder is opened,
the exhibits should state the exhibit number and identify the exhibit. For example, Exhibit 1-Proposed Parenting Plan.

Exhibit 1-Proposed Parenting Plan
Exhibit 2-Financial Information Sheet
Exhibit 3-Proposed Child Support
