TO THE HONORABLE DAVID L. EVANS OF THE 8TH ADMINISTRATIVE 
JUDICIAL REGION OF TEXAS:  
This Court's impartiality is now irrevocably in question. The act of 
setting this case for final trial after sustaining over a year of irreparable harm while 
appellate proceedings remain unresolved is itself an act of partiality warranting 
mandatory recusal pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(b)(1) and 18b(b)(2) on the 
grounds that the partiality of the tribunal is reasonably in question, and there is a 
clear personal bias and prejudice exhibited towards the undersigned. 
I. TIMELINESS 
The timeliness of this motion comes three days before a scheduled court 
proceeding, which is intended to “set the case for final trial and to enter a pre-trial 
scheduling order”.(TAB A) However, this flies in the face of three concurrent 
mandamus proceedings pending before the Second Court of Appeals, which 
concurrently seek redress for 1) the refusal of Hon. Kate Stone to hear a properly 
filed emergency TRO (No. 02-25-00164-CV), to seek vacatur of the orders issued 
beyond the court’s jurisdiction by Hon. Jeff Kaitcer on March 14, 2024 (No. 02-25-
00166-CV), (TAB B) and to reverse an improper consolidation motion granted sua 
sponte by Hon. Kenneth Newell. (No. 02-25-00171-CV) All three mandamus 
petitions are at the en banc rehearing stage, except for cause number 02-25-00166-
CV which was denied per curiam on April 24, 2024.

Despite the upcoming setting, the exception pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 
18a(b)(1)(B)(i) applies. The act of scheduling this matter for final trial itself 
constitutes grounds for recusal by casting doubt upon the tribunal's impartiality. 
The undersigned could not have anticipated that this final trial setting would 
suddenly arise amidst ongoing appellate proceedings, especially given that the case 
has remained inactive since September of 2024. 
Significantly, the opposing party has only recently re-engaged with the case 
after emergency relief was requested by the undersigned in the 233rd District Court 
due to the continuing harm inflicted upon him and his children by these unresolved 
issues. Thus, this abrupt effort to proceed with final trial under the prevailing 
circumstances starkly demonstrates judicial bias, further reinforcing the necessity 
of recusal at this juncture. 
II. PRIOR RECUSAL 
The undersigned must also note that this marks the second recusal motion 
filed in this case, the first occurring on October 7, 2024, which was denied on 
November 7, 2024, by visiting retiring Justice Gabriel.(TAB C) The motion was 
denied stating a “failure to appear”, however, all parties agreed to reset the case to 
a later due to a dental emergency sustained by the undersigned.(TAB D) There was 
no mention of this emergency in the order. Finally, it wasn’t until over four months 
later that the judges were reinstated back into the case, because the undersigned

had to remind the court coordinator when seeking a ruling on his still un-opposed 
summary judgement that’s been on the docket since February 22, 2024, to reinstate 
Hon. Munford and Hon. Kaitcer.(TAB E) Had the undersigned not proactively 
reached out, there wasn’t any indication that the reinstatement would have 
occurred. 
III. PROCEDURE 
 
The correct procedural framework required in these proceedings, particularly 
considering the irregular handling of prior matters, must be restated here: 
First, pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(e)(1), “…the clerk of the court must 
immediately deliver a copy to the respondent judge and to the presiding judge of 
the administrative judicial region in which the court is located.” Therefore, the 
undersigned formally objects to any handling from the court coordinator 
regarding these proceedings. In the prior matter there were amended referrals, 
modified pleadings, and an otherwise straightforward process became ambiguous. 
(TAB F) 
Second, pursuant to Id. 18a(e)(2): “[w]hen a respondent judge signs and 
files an order of recusal or referral, the clerk of the court must immediately deliver 
a copy to the regional presiding judge.” The same applies here as to point one. No 
disrespect is intended; this assertion is made solely insofar as the governing statute 
confers no such authority to court coordinators.

Third, pursuant to Id. 18a(g)(6)(C), the undersigned respectfully requests 
that this matter be set for hearing by telephone at the earliest practicable time, 
considering the undersigned’s current financial hardship and lack of stable 
residence. The nature and complexity of the underlying issues are not easily 
reducible to writing, which is precisely why this matter has suffered from 
prolonged procedural silence rather than meaningful discussion grounded in the 
record. A telephonic hearing is necessary to afford the Court a clearer 
understanding of the facts and to ensure due process is meaningfully observed. 
Fourth, should this motion be granted, the undersigned respectfully requests 
that this case be reassigned to an entirely different judicial district, given that both 
the 233rd and 322nd District Courts are presided over by judges directly 
implicated in the procedural and constitutional irregularities described herein. 
Fifth, if the Honorable Regional Presiding Judge chooses to refer this 
motion, the undersigned requests that the alternative language of Id.18a(g)(1) be 
exercised so that the motion may be referred to the Chief Justice of the Supreme 
Court of Texas given the circumstances of this matter, as explained in more detail 
below. 
Finally, pursuant to Id. 18a(f)(1)(A), the undersigned respectfully urges the 
Honorable James B. Munford to voluntarily recuse himself in order to avoid

justice, or in the alternative, vacate the March 14, 2024 orders for want of 
consent, and set cause number #322-744263-23 for a pre-trial conference no 
later than 14-days from the decision, effectively rendering moot these recusal 
proceeding.  
The persistent and unexplained judicial inaction—particularly in the face of 
repeated requests for emergency relief—has caused ongoing, irreparable harm to 
the undersigned and his minor children. Such circumstances are fundamentally 
incompatible with both the due process protections guaranteed by law and the best 
interest standard governing all family law proceedings in this State. There is no 
logic in proceeding to final trial in the current circumstance. One party cannot 
unilaterally decide the matter, especially when they remain silent in the face of 
serious, un-rebutted allegations.   
IV. GROUNDS FOR RECUSAL 
A. STANDARD FOR RECUSAL 
A motion to recuse is the appropriate procedural mechanism to challenge a 
judge’s impartiality. Sanchez v. State, 926 S.W.2d 391, 394 (Tex. App.—El Paso 
1996, pet. ref’d). Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(a), any party may file 
a verified motion stating with particularity the grounds upon which the presiding 
judge should not sit.

A motion to recuse is the appropriate procedural mechanism to challenge a

In addition to the statutory bases for recusal, the Due Process Clause of the 
Fourteenth Amendment provides an independent constitutional floor: recusal is 
required where the probability of actual bias is too high to be constitutionally 
tolerable. Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U.S. 868, 872 (2009) (citing 
Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U.S. 35, 47 (1975)). That standard is met where, under the 
totality of circumstances, a judge’s continued participation creates an unacceptable 
risk of bias—whether due to prior involvement, one-sided procedures, or 
unchecked discretion applied to the detriment of one party. 
Here, the cumulative record demonstrates a pattern of prejudice, one-sided 
decision-making, and disregard for both procedure and fundamental rights, rising 
well beyond the constitutional threshold described in Caperton. Recusal is not 
merely appropriate—it is required, as explained below. 
B. BIAS 
The level of bias against the undersigned started on day one. Without any 
factual basis, without holding an evidentiary hearing, and without eliciting any 
testimony from the Petitioner, the undersigned was ordered to vacate the residence 
that same day. (TAB F) No protective order was ever issued, no findings of family 
violence were made, even though Tex. Fam. Code §§ 83.006 and 85.001 plainly 
require such findings.

tolerable. Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U.S. 868, 872 (2009) (citing
Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U.S. 35, 47 (1975)). That standard is met where, under the
totality of circumstances, a judge’s continued participation creates an unacceptable
risk of bias—whether due to prior involvement, one-sided procedures, or
unchecked discretion applied to the detriment of one party.

Here, the cumulative record demonstrates a pattern of prejudice, one-sided
decision-making, and disregard for both procedure and fundamental rights, rising
well beyond the constitutional threshold described in Caperton. Recusal is not
merely appropriate—it is required, as explained below.

B. BIAS

The level of bias against the undersigned started on day one. Without any
factual basis, without holding an evidentiary hearing, and without eliciting any
testimony from the Petitioner, the undersigned was ordered to vacate the residence
that same day. (TAB F) No protective order was ever issued, no findings of family
violence were made, even though Tex. Fam. Code §§ 83.006 and 85.001 plainly

require such findings.

This decision, even though temporarily, severed the parent-child relationship 
without any lawful basis. The Family Code’s strict requirements were ignored. Tex. 
Fam. Code § 83.006(a) permits exclusion of a party from the home only if (1) the 
applicant files an affidavit describing facts requiring exclusion, and (2) appears at 
the hearing to testify to those facts. Section 83.006(b) further requires that the court 
make three findings: (i) the applicant resides (or recently resided) at the premises, 
(ii) the other party committed family violence within the past 30 days, and (iii) 
there is a clear and present danger of future family violence. 
The only thing before the court were allegations of family violence, which 
were never substantiated. Rather, they were leveraged into a settlement agreement 
that removed the children from their own home in February of 2024. (TAB G) A 
court cannot sever a parent-child bond on mere allegations. Tex. Fam Code 
153.002. Yet here, that’s what has occurred, and the undersigned has sought 
answers from this court – and has received nothing but complete silence.  
Now, over fourteen months later, a facially invalid consent judgement has 
been permitted to destroy the lives of not only the undersigned – but his children, 
all while enabling the Petitioner, MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS, to get away

described in Armentrout v. Murdock, 779 S.W.2d 119 (Tex. App. 
1989) and Southern Pacific Transp. Co. v. Stoot, 530 S.W.2d 930 (Tex. 
1975) exemplify this approach. These judges "recognized this problem, took 
responsibility for the condition of their dockets, and moved against the troubles of 
delay" by instituting systems to ensure timely case progression. This example 
demonstrates that effective judges take ownership of their dockets rather than 
deflecting responsibility. 
The responsibility of judges for docket management is further emphasized 
by the accountability measures in place. In re Rose, 144 S.W.3d 661 (Tex. 
2004) demonstrates that judges can face disciplinary action for administrative 
misconduct, including failures related to court management. Judge Rose's own 
acknowledgment that "the responsibility is mine" and "I'm the bottom line" reflects 
the understanding within the judiciary itself that judges bear ultimate responsibility 
for their courts' functioning. 
A plea to the jurisdiction has been filed as of April 24, 2025, to serve as 
another reminder to the court that these orders must be vacated as a matter of law, 
not finalized into finality. (TAB H)

The record in this case reveals a sustained pattern of judicial favoritism 
toward opposing counsel, warranting recusal. In Sun Exploration & Production 
Co. v. Jackson, 783 S.W.2d 202, 204 (Tex. 1989), the Texas Supreme Court 
acknowledged that while individual rulings may not rise to the level of reversible 
error, an appellate court may nonetheless detect from the record a clear pattern of 
favoritism that undermines the appearance of impartiality. 
Recusal is required where such favoritism would cause a reasonable 
observer to doubt the judge’s neutrality. Here the level of favoritism is so high that 
the courts below improperly grant motions sua-sponte without hearings to the 
Petitioner’s benefit, when the same is done to the undersigned to his detriment. As 
the court explained in Guillen v. Cameron County, No. 13-16-00682-CV (Tex. 
App.—Corpus Christi–Edinburg Nov. 15, 2018, no pet.): 
“Recusal is appropriate if a reasonable member of the public at large, 
knowing all the facts in the public domain concerning the judge’s conduct, would 
harbor doubts as to the judge’s impartiality.” That standard is met here. An 
objective observer reviewing the docket would see:

pursue an extramarital affair;

remain silent in briefing, only to appear at hearing and object, is both prejudicial 
and professionally improper. Such conduct should not be condoned by the Court, 
particularly when it operates to the detriment of a self-represented parent seeking 
long-delayed relief.  
CONCLUSION  
 
Imagine being labeled a criminal—accused of abuse—while a court is told 
that a protective order already exists against you. Imagine that the very person you 
supported for years and who benefitted from your success suddenly claims 
financial indigence, asserts full responsibility for all expenses, and serves you—at 
Christmas—with allegations designed to remove you from your home, your 
children, and your livelihood. Now imagine this: You built a business from home—
intentionally, strategically—so that you could raise your children and be a present 
father, not just a provider. You tailored your entire life around being there for them. 
Now imagine the State—without lawful authority—rips that life away. No 
hearing. No findings. No emergency. No evidence. And then the State does 
nothing. It sits on its hands while you fight, alone, for over fifteen months—
pleading for relief, receiving only silence. And the reason? There isn’t one that 
can be traced to the record, meaning it must be extrajudicial and derived from 
actual bias. There exists no basis for the current orders to remain in effect, yet they 
are. The court chooses to act sua sponte only when it benefits the opposing party.

In a world where you take the initiative of showing up, ready to defend 
yourself—your family, your home, your rights—only for those rights to be stripped 
away in the blink of an eye before being afforded the chance to defend yourself. 
No process. No fairness. No law.  
Is that how justice works? Is that how a divorce should begin? Because that 
is exactly what happened here. This is more than a denial of due process. This is 
a system abandoning its core duty to protect children and uphold the law. This 
is a constitutional wound—one that continues to bleed with every day this court 
refuses to act. This recusal must be granted as a matter of law—not just to restore 
fairness, but to prevent this travesty from becoming permanent. Each day this 
continues is another day of unexplained, avoidable suffering inflicted on the 
children at the center of this case while the opposing side sits in silence. The court 
has an obligation to conduct their operations within the bounds of the law and 
protect the family unit. Here, this court took no issue in destroying it from the 
onset. 
Therefore, notwithstanding the docket management and favoritism displayed

Subject: RE: Today's hearing at 11 CL-12105
Dear Ms. Baker, and Mr. Carter,
I am writing to respectfully request a rescheduling of today’s recusal hearing due to an unexpected medical issue. Late
last night, I began experiencing severe tooth pain, which has now escalated to significant facial swelling and intense
discomfort. The pain is currently affecting my ability to speak, eat, and focus, making it challenging to fully participate in
today’s proceedings.
Specifically, it's my bottom left molar which the nerve is open and exposed causing significant pain. 
I want to sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, especially given the efforts the court has made to
accommodate this hearing. Please know that this request is made only out of necessity, and I deeply regret the timing as
I would prefer to move the case forward.
This request comes with a high degree of reluctance given the unexpected technical difficulties experienced last time and
would not be making it if it wasn't absolutely necessary.
Thank you all for your understanding and consideration. I am committed to continuing with the hearing at the earliest
possible opportunity as I am eager to move the case forward.
I wanted to inform the court as soon as possible out of respect for the courts busy schedule.
I currently am unable to locate the case on research texas, as I've been trying to file a formal notice but given the time I
wanted to ensure the court was made aware as soon as possible of the situation.
Lines of communication are open for further discussion or if any further information is needed.
With respect,
Charles Myers

Ms. Baker,

My Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, filed February 22, 2024, remains unopposed for over a year. Under TRCP
166a(c) and Local Rule 4.01(d), this motion is ripe for ruling. Opposing counsel’s failure to respond waives any objection.

Further, opposing counsel (CC'ed here), cannot prosecute her case in accordance with Texas law, and still has an
outstanding rule 12 motion that is now also unopposed.

Agranting of either motion would resolve the core case issues, and given the circumstances, is duly warranted.

| formally request an immediate ruling or confirmation of when the Court will act. Further delay is unacceptable.

If the judges cannot legally act given opposing counsels failure to comply with Tex. R. CIV. P. 237a, then the matter should

be brought before David L. Evans without delay.

Sincerely,

Charles Dustin Myers

Mr. Dustin:

Prior to providing available dates to set your hearing request, the Court must know how much time you are
requesting for the hearing? Further, you must E-file or personally appear with a Notice of Hearing for the
Court to set the hearing.

Thank you,

If you received a Notice of Dismissal, you MUST file a Motion to Retain. The Motion
MUST be SET, HEARD and concluded with a SIGNED ORDER TO RETAIN.

DO NOT EMAIL ME FOR A SETTING REGARDING THE DWOP.

Hello Lindsey,

| hope you are doing well. | am following up on the Myers v. Myers matter (Cause No. 322-744263-23 in the 322nd District
Court), which was remanded back from federal court on December 17, 2024. As of today, the opposing party still has not
filed the Notice of Remand or otherwise re-engaged with the case. This has left our case in limbo on the court’s docket. In
the meantime, Charles Dustin Myers (Respondent), is suffering ongoing harm each day without the court’s intervention on
pending matters.

To recap the situation briefly:

The federal court remanded the case to state court on 12/17/2024. Under Texas Rule 237a, it was Petitioner’s
responsibility to file the remand order with the clerk and notify us. That never happened. We are now three months post-
remand, and the case has not been officially re-docketed due to this oversight.

4/24/25, 11:46 PM Gmail - Ruling Requested — Unopposed Summary Judgment (Filed 2/22/2024) — Case No. 322-744263-23

| have multiple pending motions that were filed before and after the remand. Critically, Petitioner and her counsel have not
responded to ANY of these motions. For example, the Motion for Summary Judgment (filed 2/26/2024) received no
response. More urgently, our Ex Parte Motion for Child Custody, Exclusive Use of Marital Residence, Contempt, and
Sanctions (filed 2/12/2025) remains unopposed and unaddressed. We also filed a Proposed Order on 2/20/2025 and a
Request for Immediate Ruling on 2/28/2025, with no response from the other side.

The issues in that ex parte motion are time-sensitive and critical: we need a court order for custody and to regain access
to the marital home. Opposing counsel’s failure to follow procedure has effectively stalled relief that desperately needs
attention. (Respondent has been without access to his home and children for an extended period through no fault of his
own). There are also allegations of contempt by the opposing party that have not been heard because of these delays.

Given this extraordinary situation, we respectfully ask the Court to take immediate action. Specifically, we request one of
the following at the Court’s earliest convenience (and we truly mean as soon as possible, even this week if feasible):

Immediate ruling/signing of orders: Since the motions are unopposed, the Court can rule on them without a hearing. |
have a proposed Order for the ex parte motion ready for Judge Kaitcer’s signature. | urge the Court to sign an order
granting Respondent temporary custody of the children and exclusive use of the residence immediately. This would
provide much-needed stability while the case proceeds. Similarly, the motion for summary judgment can be granted on
the papers, as no controverting evidence or response was ever filed by Petitioner.

Emergency hearing: If the Court prefers to hold a hearing, please provide the soonest possible date and time for an
emergency hearing on the Ex Parte Motion (2/12/2025), and a notice will be filed tomorrow. | am prepared to appear on
short notice. Given that the motion is unopposed, the hearing should be brief. Respondent will gladly testify to confirm the
facts if needed. He just needs the Court’s authorization to move forward — every day of delay is another day he is barred
from his home and children.

Filing of Remand Order: To remove any procedural barrier, Respondent will obtain a certified copy of the federal remand
order and he will file it himself (or hand-deliver a copy) to the Court. If the clerk needs that filed separately to officially
reopen the case, please let me know - it will be done immediately. | do not want a clerical formality to stand between the
children and justice any longer.

Sanctions for non-compliance (if appropriate): Resppndent also wants the Court to be aware that opposing counsel’s
conduct — failing to file the remand notice and ignoring court filings — is sanctionable. While the priority is getting relief for
the children, the intent is to address this issue at the appropriate time. For now, this failure should at least not be
rewarded by further delaying proceedings. Respondent shouldn't have to wait indefinitely due to the other side’s
procedural neglect.

In sum, Respondent is asking for the Court’s help to break the logjam created by the opposing party. Our requests are
straightforward and unopposed. The court has the authority to grant the relief either ex parte or by default given the
circumstances. Respondent is simply requesting that the Court exercise that authority as soon as possible to prevent
further irreparable harm.

My tone in this email is urgent because the situation is urgent. | have been exceedingly patient while trying every avenue
to move this case forward. With each passing day, the situation worsens and the children at issue remain in uncertainty. |
trust that the 322nd District Court strives to resolve such matters fairly and expeditiously, and | am eager to assist in any
way to facilitate a prompt resolution.

Proposed next steps:

If Judge Kaitcer (or the assigned judge) is available to review the file tomorrow, we urge him to sign the proposed Order
(filed 2/20/2025) granting the relief in the 2/12/2025 motion. | am available by phone or email if the Court has any
questions or slight modifications to the order.

Alternatively, please provide a setting for an emergency hearing as early as possible. Even a telephone or Zoom hearing
would be acceptable, given the urgency, if that would expedite the process. A notice of hearing will be filed Monday.

If there are any concerns about the procedural posture (such as the missing Notice of Remand), please let me know. | am
prepared to cure any such issue immediately. | can file the remand order and serve opposing counsel (to the extent she
will accept service) to remove any doubt that the case is properly before the Court.

Thank you very much for your time and attention to this matter, Lindsey. | understand the Court has a busy docket, but
this case has unusual circumstances that warrant special handling. | greatly appreciate any assistance you can provide in
conveying the urgency of this situation to Judge Kaitcer, Judge Munford, or in the alternative, Judge Evans. | am hopeful
that, with the Court’s intervention, we can obtain a ruling or hearing in a matter of days, bringing much-needed relief and
allowing the case to progress.

ALL motions must be set for a hearing. If you are requesting relief from the Court, you must provide the
Court with a formal Notice of Court Proceeding to set each of your E-filed motions. | also informed you of
this in my previous email response. | will take no further action responding to your email communications
unless you are requesting an in person hearing AND provide the Court with a E-filed Notice of Court
Proceeding in compliance with the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Please refer to the Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure, The Texas Family Code, and the Tarrant County Family Court’s Local Rules.

The 322" District Court and Associate Court hears ALL matters in person and not by submission.

Thank you,

Dear Ms. Baker,

Thanks for your response.

As | previously pointed out, the Order of Assignment from Judge David L. Evans assigned Justice Lee Gabriel to the case.
That assignment remains in effect until Judge Evans issues a written termination order, as stated. To my knowledge, no
such order has been issued or served.

Until that occurs, it would be procedurally improper to request a court hearing, particularly given that the opposing party
has yet to fulfill their obligation under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 237a by filing a Notice of Remand after removal to
federal court.

It would be helpful if these issues could be resolved as soon as possible so that the case can proceed effectively.

Best regards,
Charles Dustin Myers

NO. 322-744263-23 
IN THE 322nd DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
TO THE HONORABLE JAMES MUNFORD: 
The record reveals a pattern of the Court acting beyond its jurisdiction: on January 16, 
2024, the Court ousted Respondent from the marital residence without any finding of family 
violence or protective order; on March 26, 2024, the Court entered “Agreed” Temporary 
Orders without Respondent’s consent, flouting the statutory procedures for entry of such 
orders. These actions violate Respondent’s due process rights and the Texas Family Code. Under 
Texas law, orders issued without jurisdiction or in the absence of a party’s consent are void 
and cannot confer jurisdiction. Respondent asks the Court to recognize these fundamental defects 
and dismiss the current orders as a matter of law. 
Until these orders are resolved, or the court issues written findings regarding their 
legitimacy, Respondent will not appear and risk further deprivation of his rights from this court.

I. INTRODUCTION
Petitioner filed a divorce petition under Title 5 of the Texas Family Code on December 
18, 2023. That petition did not seek exclusive possession of the residence or ask that Respondent 
be excluded from the home. Shortly thereafter, on December 22, 2023, Petitioner filed a separate 
Application for Protective Order under Title 4 of the Family Code, in which she explicitly 
requested exclusive possession of the home, removal of Respondent, and child support. The 
Court consolidated the protective‐order case into the divorce case.  
On January 16, 2024, the court—without holding an evidentiary hearing or finding family 
violence—entered Temporary Orders granting Petitioner exclusive possession of the home and 
primary custody and child support, and requiring Respondent to vacate the residence that same 
day. No protective order was ever issued and no findings of family violence were made, even 
though Tex. Fam. Code §§ 83.006 and 85.001 plainly require such findings. In the weeks that 
followed, the court continued these arrangements and ultimately entered “Agreed” Temporary 
Orders (March 26, 2024) allocating parenting time and support. All of these extreme orders were 
based solely on Petitioner’s Title 4 application (and allegations of family violence), and no 
amendments to the pleadings were ever filed to convert the case into a Title 5 SAPCR. 
Respondent never received any notice or hearing on custody, possession, or support issues under 
Title 5. 
II. Legal Standards
The trial court’s authority is strictly limited by the statutes and pleadings. It may consider 
only the claims and relief expressly pleaded by the parties, and must follow the Family Code’s 
procedures for protective orders and SAPCRs. Subject‐matter jurisdiction is a threshold issue: if

Title 5.

II. Legal Standards

The trial court’s authority is strictly limited by the statutes and pleadings. It may consider
only the claims and relief expressly pleaded by the parties, and must follow the Family Code’s

procedures for protective orders and SAPCRs. Subject-matter jurisdiction is a threshold issue: if

=== PAGE 64 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
the court acted beyond the law, its orders are void. A plea to the jurisdiction is decided as a 
matter of law when the relevant facts are undisputed (see Tex. Dep’t of Parks & Wildlife v. 
Miranda, 133 S.W.3d 217, 228 (Tex. 2004)). Here, the material jurisdictional facts are not in 
dispute. 
III. Title 4 (Protective Order) Proceedings Cannot Support Custody or Support 
Under Texas law, a protective‐order proceeding (Title 4) is not a custody (SAPCR) 
proceeding (Title 5). The San Antonio Court of Appeals recently reaffirmed that without a proper 
SAPCR petition under Title 5, a court may not award conservatorship, possession, or support. In 
Rivera v. Figueroa (Tex. App.–San Antonio 2019), the court held that orders issued in a 
protective‐order case cannot support conservatorship or child‐support relief unless a Title 5 
petition was filed and noticed. Likewise, In re Sheffield, 639 S.W.2d 270 (Tex. App.–Dallas 
1982), long held that Title 4 and Title 5 proceedings are jurisdictionally separate: “a court may 
not grant relief beyond the scope of the protective‐order statute without compliance with the 
SAPCR statutes” (sheffield, 639 S.W.2d at 272-73). Here, Petitioner’s December 22 Title 4 
application was never amended or converted into a Title 5 petition. Respondent never waived 
notice or a hearing on conservatorship/possession issues. The court’s decision to exclude 
Respondent from the home and divest him of custody on January 16, 2024 therefore had no 
jurisdictional basis. In short, “[w]ithout a valid protective order in place, the court lacked 
jurisdiction to continue enforcing the extreme relief originally granted”. 
IV. Statutory Prerequisites for Exclusion and Protective Orders Were Not Met 
Even if the court treated the relief as a protective‐order, the Family Code’s strict 
requirements were ignored. Tex. Fam. Code § 83.006(a) permits exclusion of a party from the

Miranda, 133 S.W.3d 217, 228 (Tex. 2004)). Here, the material jurisdictional facts are not in

dispute.

III. Title 4 (Protective Order) Proceedings Cannot Support Custody or Support

Under Texas law, a protective-order proceeding (Title 4) is not a custody (SAPCR)
proceeding (Title 5). The San Antonio Court of Appeals recently reaffirmed that without a proper
SAPCR petition under Title 5, a court may not award conservatorship, possession, or support. In
Rivera v. Figueroa (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2019), the court held that orders issued in a
protective-order case cannot support conservatorship or child-support relief unless a Title 5
petition was filed and noticed. Likewise, In re Sheffield, 639 S.W.2d 270 (Tex. App.—Dallas
1982), long held that Title 4 and Title 5 proceedings are jurisdictionally separate: “a court may
not grant relief beyond the scope of the protective-order statute without compliance with the
SAPCR statutes” (sheffield, 639 S.W.2d at 272-73). Here, Petitioner’s December 22 Title 4
application was never amended or converted into a Title 5 petition. Respondent never waived
notice or a hearing on conservatorship/possession issues. The court’s decision to exclude
Respondent from the home and divest him of custody on January 16, 2024 therefore had no
jurisdictional basis. In short, “[w]ithout a valid protective order in place, the court lacked

jurisdiction to continue enforcing the extreme relief originally granted”.

IV. Statutory Prerequisites for Exclusion and Protective Orders Were Not Met

Even if the court treated the relief as a protective-order, the Family Code’s strict

requirements were ignored. Tex. Fam. Code § 83.006(a) permits exclusion of a party from the

=== PAGE 65 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
home only if (1) the applicant files a sworn affidavit describing facts requiring exclusion, and (2) 
appears at the hearing to testify on those facts. Section 83.006(b) further requires that the court 
make three findings: (i) the applicant resides (or recently resided) at the premises, (ii) the other 
party committed family violence within the past 30 days, and (iii) there is a clear and present 
danger of future family violence. Likewise, § 85.001(a) mandates that at the close of a 
protective‐order hearing, the court must explicitly find whether family violence occurred. If so, 
the court “shall” issue a protective order against the perpetrator. In this case, none of these 
prerequisites were satisfied. Petitioner did file an application and affidavit, but no hearing on 
January 16 (or thereafter) produced any finding of family violence. The court did not issue a 
protective order as the statute requires, and instead simply extended the eviction and custody 
restrictions indefinitely. By failing to hold a hearing, make any family‐violence finding, or enter 
a protective order, the court “bypass[ed] the statutory prerequisites” entirely. Without those 
statutorily required findings, the January 16 “kick‐out” and custody order was outside the court’s 
power. 
V. All Orders Exceeding the Pleadings or Statutory Authority Are Void
It is a bedrock rule that a Texas court must confine its rulings to the relief requested by 
the pleadings and authorized by statute. Any order beyond that scope is void. The Houston First 
Court of Appeals has stated that “[a]n order purporting to grant relief beyond the pleadings is 
void ab initio”. In Guillory v. Boykins, 442 S.W.3d 682, 690 (Tex. App.–Houston [1st Dist.] 
2014, no pet.), the court held that where a trial court lacks jurisdiction or statutory authority to 
grant the relief, the order is void. Similarly, In re P.M.G., 405 S.W.3d 406, 416–17 (Tex. App.–
Texarkana 2013, no pet.), confirms that orders entered without pleadings or outside statutory 
scope are null. Here, not only did the protective‐order pleadings not include any SAPCR claims,

home only if (1) the applicant files a sworn affidavit describing facts requiring exclusion, and (2)
appears at the hearing to testify on those facts. Section 83.006(b) further requires that the court
make three findings: (i) the applicant resides (or recently resided) at the premises, (ii) the other
party committed family violence within the past 30 days, and (iii) there is a clear and present

a protective order, the court “bypass[ed] the statutory prerequisites” entirely. Without those
statutorily required findings, the January 16 “kick-out” and custody order was outside the court’s

power.

V. All Orders Exceeding the Pleadings or Statutory Authority Are Void

It is a bedrock rule that a Texas court must confine its rulings to the relief requested by
the pleadings and authorized by statute. Any order beyond that scope is void. The Houston First
Court of Appeals has stated that “[a]n order purporting to grant relief beyond the pleadings is
void ab initio”. In Guillory v. Boykins, 442 S.W.3d 682, 690 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist. ]
2014, no pet.), the court held that where a trial court lacks jurisdiction or statutory authority to
grant the relief, the order is void. Similarly, Jn re PM.G., 405 S.W.3d 406, 416-17 (Tex. App.—
Texarkana 2013, no pet.), confirms that orders entered without pleadings or outside statutory

scope are null. Here, not only did the protective-order pleadings not include any SAPCR claims,

=== PAGE 66 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
but the later “agreed” orders on March 26, 2024 were not signed or even consented to by 
Respondent (violating Tex. R. Civ. P. 11). In short, every custody and exclusion order in this case 
was “predicated on a void order”. As the Second Court of Appeals recognized in In re C.L., 933 
S.W.2d 402, 405 (Tex. App.–Fort Worth 1996, no writ), an order that is void ab initio “cannot 
form the basis for any valid subsequent judgment”.  That’s exactly what is happening here. The 
court is now moving to finalize fraud, constitutional deprivation, and is trying to finalize its’ 
original excision of Respondent’s constitutional rights. The court cannot destroy a family and 
then move to finalize that without a lawful basis, and over orders that are fundamentally void. 
IV. Violation of Respondent’s Constitutional Rights to Due Process and Family Integrity 
The trial court’s actions not only violated statute but also trampled Respondent’s 
fundamental constitutional rights. By evicting the Respondent from his home and effectively 
separating him from his children with no prior notice or opportunity to be heard, the court 
deprived him of liberty and property without due process of law. This violates Article I, § 19 of 
the Texas Constitution (the “due course of law” guarantee) and the Fourteenth Amendment to 
the U.S. Constitution. Now, the court seeks to finalize this fundamental error amidst an ongoing 
appeal, showing a continuous and complete disregard for the Respondent’s rights.  
A. Deprivation of Property Without Due Process 
The January 16 order forced Respondent to vacate his own home on the same day it was 
issued. A person’s right to occupy their home is a significant property interest, protected by due 
process. Yet Respondent was ousted immediately, with no notice that such relief would be sought 
and no chance to contest the allegations. The Texas Constitution and the 14th Amendment both 
forbid the State from depriving any person of property without due process of law. Fuentes v. 
Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 81-82 (1972) (even temporary, non-final deprivations of property require 
--- OCR TEXT ---
but the later “agreed” orders on March 26, 2024 were not signed or even consented to by
Respondent (violating Tex. R. Civ. P. 11). In short, every custody and exclusion order in this case
was “predicated on a void order”. As the Second Court of Appeals recognized in Jn re C.L., 933
S.W.2d 402, 405 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1996, no writ), an order that is void ab initio “cannot
form the basis for any valid subsequent judgment”. That’s exactly what is happening here. The
court is now moving to finalize fraud, constitutional deprivation, and is trying to finalize its’
original excision of Respondent’s constitutional rights. The court cannot destroy a family and

then move to finalize that without a lawful basis, and over orders that are fundamentally void.

IV. Violation of Respondent’s Constitutional Rights to Due Process and Family Integrity

The trial court’s actions not only violated statute but also trampled Respondent’s
fundamental constitutional rights. By evicting the Respondent from his home and effectively
separating him from his children with no prior notice or opportunity to be heard, the court
deprived him of liberty and property without due process of law. This violates Article I, § 19 of
the Texas Constitution (the “due course of law” guarantee) and the Fourteenth Amendment to
the U.S. Constitution. Now, the court seeks to finalize this fundamental error amidst an ongoing

appeal, showing a continuous and complete disregard for the Respondent’s rights.
A. Deprivation of Property Without Due Process

The January 16 order forced Respondent to vacate his own home on the same day it was
issued. A person’s right to occupy their home is a significant property interest, protected by due
process. Yet Respondent was ousted immediately, with no notice that such relief would be sought
and no chance to contest the allegations. The Texas Constitution and the 14° Amendment both
forbid the State from depriving any person of property without due process of law. Fuentes v.

Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 81-82 (1972) (even temporary, non-final deprivations of property require

notice and hearing absent extraordinary circumstances). While Texas law does allow ex parte 
orders in truly exigent circumstances, those orders must be narrowly tailored and followed 
promptly by a full hearing. Here, the statutory requirements for an ex parte kick-out were 
disregarded, and Respondent was left homeless and separated from his belongings based on one-
sided assertions. This is precisely the kind of state action that due process is meant to guard 
against. 
B. Deprivation of Parental Rights Without Due Process 
Even more critically, the court’s orders infringed Respondent’s fundamental right to 
parent his children, also without due process. A parent’s interest in the care, custody, and control 
of their children is fundamental. The United States Supreme Court has recognized that “the 
interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children…is perhaps the oldest of the 
fundamental liberty interests recognized by this Court.” Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 
(2000) (plurality op.). Likewise, the Texas Supreme Court has affirmed that “the fundamental 
right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children” is 
constitutionally protected. In re C.J.C., 603 S.W.3d 804, 811 (Tex. 2020) (citing Troxel, 530 U.S. 
at 66). Governmental interference with this right is subject to strict scrutiny and must be 
accomplished only with rigorous procedural safeguards. 
Here, Respondent’s removal from the home effectively altered custody of the children 
without any hearing or finding of unfitness. Respondent went from being an equal managing 
conservator of the children to having zero possession or access (by virtue of being excluded from 
the home and the children’s presence) overnight and without notice. This is a profound 
deprivation of parental rights. As the U.S. Supreme Court held in Stanley v. Illinois, an unwed 
father could not be presumed unfit and have his children taken without a hearing – “the Due

father could not be presumed unfit and have his children taken without a hearing — “the Due

=== PAGE 68 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that [a father] be given a hearing on 
his fitness as a parent before his children are removed from his custody.” Stanley v. Illinois, 405 
U.S. 645, 649 (1972) (emphasis added). The State “cannot, consistently with due process, 
merely presume” a parent’s unfitness or danger and bypass a hearing; “parental unfitness 
must be established on the basis of individualized proof” before a child is taken away. Id. at 
647, 649. Yet in Respondent’s case, the court did exactly what Stanley forbids – it presumed the 
necessity of removing the father, without any adversarial testing of the evidence or finding of 
actual misconduct and left the determination for later (a hearing that kept getting postponed). 
This violated Respondent’s procedural due process rights to be heard before being deprived of 
custody of his children. 
Moreover, the substantive aspect of due process was violated. There is a “strong 
presumption that the best interest of a child is served by remaining with a fit parent.” Troxel, 
530 U.S. at 68-69. The government may not “infringe on the fundamental right of parents to 
make child rearing decisions simply because a state judge believes a ‘better decision’ could 
be made.” Id. at 72 (plurality op.). In the absence of any evidence or finding that Respondent 
was an unfit or dangerous parent, removing his children from him was an arbitrary infringement 
on his fundamental liberty interest. The orders entered in this case prioritized a one-sided 
allegation over a father’s constitutional rights, in a manner repugnant to both the Texas and U.S. 
Constitutions. Article I, Section 19 of the Texas Constitution guarantees that no citizen shall be 
deprived of liberty or property except by the due course of the law of the land – here, 
Respondent was deprived of both without the lawful procedures or any adjudication of 
wrongdoing.

In sum, the process (or lack thereof) employed by the court fell far short of constitutional 
requirements. This constitutional infirmity is independently sufficient to render the court’s orders 
void. A judgment entered in violation of due process is void and subject to collateral attack. 
Peralta v. Heights Medical Center, Inc., 485 U.S. 80, 84-85 (1988) (judgment rendered without 
proper notice violates due process and is void). The proper remedy for a void order that stems 
from a due process violation is to declare it a nullity and dismiss any action that cannot proceed 
without it. 
VI. Plea to the Jurisdiction Must Be Granted 
The undisputed record shows no factual or legal basis for the court’s jurisdiction over the 
extreme relief granted. Under Miranda v. Texas Dept. of Parks & Wildlife, a plea to the 
jurisdiction should be granted as a matter of law if the jurisdictional facts are undisputed or 
uncontroverted by competent evidence. Here, there is no genuine issue that (a) no protective 
order was issued and no findings of family violence were made, (b) no Title 5 SAPCR notice of 
hearing exists on the record, or was ever on file, and (c) all of Petitioner’s requests for home 
exclusion and support were styled under Title 4 and unsupported by any pleaded conservatorship 
claim. The court cannot “proceed further on the merits” without first resolving these fundamental 
defects. Because these jurisdictional defects are purely legal, a full evidentiary hearing is 
unnecessary – the Court should rule as a matter of law that it never had authority to enter any of 
the challenged orders, vacate them accordingly, and allow the status quo to reset. Additionally, 
the March 14, 2024, orders are a mere extension of the initial orders, which claim consent where 
consent is not present. These orders must be vacated as a matter of law as this court has no power 
to rule on void orders.

Respondent puts the court on notice that this plea serves as non-appearance notice in that 
he will not participate in any further proceedings until these issues are resolved in writing on the 
record, and will challenge any orders or decisions made prior to the resolution of these issues. 
VII. PRAYER 
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Charles Dustin Myers respectfully prays that the 
Court: 
1. Rule, as a matter of law, that the January 16, 2024, exclusion and custody order and all 
subsequent temporary orders are void ab initio for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction; 
2. Vacate and rescind those orders, and dismiss with prejudice any custody, possession, or 
support claims that rest on them; alternatively, dismiss all SAPCR claims for want of 
proper pleadings, notice, and jurisdiction; 
3. Issue a written ruling on this plea as required by law, and stay all further proceedings in 
this case pending resolution of this jurisdictional challenge; and 
4. Grant such other and further relief, at law or in equity, to which Respondent may be justly 
entitled. 
Respectfully submitted,
