Issues Presented 
 
A. Whether the trial court clearly abused its discretion by repeatedly failing 
to apply mandatory procedural safeguards under the Texas Family 
Code—culminating in temporary orders erroneously rendered as a 
consent judgment without the consent of both parties, causing ongoing, 
irreparable harm and thus warranting mandamus relief. 
 
 
B. Whether the trial court’s prolonged inaction on critical pending motions, 
combined with opposing counsel’s failure to prosecute for over eleven 
months, constitutes a clear abuse of discretion—leaving Relator without 
an adequate remedy by ordinary appeal, and thus requiring immediate 
mandamus relief to prevent further harm.

SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT 
This mandamus petition runs concurrently with cause number 02-25-00164-
CV, currently at the rehearing stage following a summary denial issued April 11, 
2025. Relator seeks immediate relief from facially void temporary orders—issued 
without consent or required findings—that have deprived him of his home, 
children, and fundamental due process rights for over a year. Despite clear 
procedural violations and substantial ongoing harm, the trial court’s prolonged 
inaction and procedural irregularities have effectively denied Relator any 
meaningful avenue for relief through ordinary appellate remedies, necessitating 
this court's immediate mandamus intervention. 
ARGUMENT 
A. Mandamus Standard
Mandamus is available when a trial court clearly abuses its discretion or 
violates a legal duty, and no adequate remedy by appeal exists. See In re 
Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 135-36 (Tex. 2004). This Court has a 
duty to intervene when a trial court’s actions cause irreparable harm, particularly 
when they infringe on constitutional rights or ignore statutory mandates. See In re 
Lee, 411 S.W.3d 445, 454 (Tex. 2013). Such is the case here, as shown below. The 
argument examines four separate orders which have left Relator significantly

one-sided, un-opposed litigation. MR 1 The trial court below has abused its’ 
discretion across four separate settings that produced no valid outcome and 
ongoing harm. 
B. Setting #1 January 16, 2024 – “Kick-Out” Order
The trial court's order dated January 16, 2024, violated critical provisions of 
the Texas Family Code designed explicitly to protect fundamental due process 
rights in family law matters. Specifically, the order disregarded mandated findings 
required under Texas Family Code § 85.001 before a party can be excluded from 
their residence. To lawfully exclude Mr. Myers, the court was required to find 
from credible evidence that the applicant resided on the premises within the 
preceding 30 days, that Mr. Myers committed family violence within the same 
timeframe, and that a clear and present danger of continued family violence 
existed absent his exclusion. None of these essential statutory conditions were 
met, as the hearing was continued and consolidated, but never substantively heard 
APP 6.1. 
Moreover, the January 16 exclusion order flagrantly violated procedural 
requirements for temporary orders in suits affecting the parent-child relationship 
(SAPCR) under Texas Family Code § 105.001. APP 8.1 Mr. Myers's 
exclusion from his home effectively severed access to his children without any 
evidence or testimony presented, and without the requisite evidentiary hearing 
being held. Such action directly breached §105.001(b), which  prohibits

related to temporary conservatorship without first providing notice and holding an 
evidentiary hearing. APP 8.1
Additionally, this order egregiously contravened fundamental due process 
protections under both the United States and Texas Constitutions. By forcibly 
removing Mr. Myers from his home and separating him from his children without 
affording any meaningful opportunity for notice, hearing, or objection, the trial 
court infringed upon his fundamental liberty interests recognized under the 
Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Article I, §19 of the Texas 
Constitution. APP 13 Both provisions unequivocally guarantee protection from 
arbitrary deprivation of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, 
mandating at a minimum adequate notice and a meaningful opportunity to be 
heard before any severe deprivation occurs (Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & 
Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306 (1950)). 
In sum, the January 16, 2024, order initiated a chain of events resulting in 
the unlawful disruption of a fit parent's relationship with his children, inflicted 
ongoing harm upon Mr. Myers's at-home business operations, and clearly 
undermined the explicit statutory mandate prioritizing the child's best interests in 
conservatorship and possession matters (Texas Family Code § 153.002). This 
improper order set a detrimental course, being subsequently reset on January 22, 
2024, without rectifying these foundational legal defects.

C. Setting #2 - January 22, 2024 - Extension
The due process violations compounded at the January 22, 2024, setting. 
Relator appeared ready for the rescheduled hearing, prepared to finally confront 
the allegations. The opposing party, however, thwarted any hearing by engaging 
new counsel at the courtroom door moments before the start and requesting a 
continuance, which was granted without a motion. MR. 7.1 
Over Relator’s objection, the trial court granted the continuance – again 
without any evidence or affidavit showing good cause, in contravention of Tex. R. 
Civ. P. 251 (which permits continuances only for sufficient cause supported by 
affidavit or with consent). Here, the “temporary” order ousting Relator – already 
issued without basis – was prolonged with no procedural safeguards. The court’s 
indulgence of the opposing party’s delay tactics deprived Relator of any prompt 
post-deprivation hearing to which he was entitled. Relator remained out of his 
home and apart from his children under an unauthorized extension of an already 
unlawful order. APP 5.1 This Court should not countenance such end-runs around 
due process. When a parent has been deprived of fundamental rights, the onus is on 
the trial court to hold a prompt, lawful hearing – not to repeatedly delay and extend 
the deprivation. The trial court’s actions on January 16 and 22 reflect a complete 
collapse of the procedural safeguards that protect litigants; mandamus is warranted

counter motion, which never came. MR 13.3 
 
It’s important to note that the claims raised against Mrs. Myers are now, in 
part, admitted by default pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 198, including the claims that: 
1) she transferred $1,576 to herself on December 15, 2023, using a third party

out of the family home on March 6, 2024. MR 19.13

unilaterally locked the Relator out of his own house. This extrajudicial “self-
help” occurred while Relator’s emergency motion was still pending undecided. The

the March 14 hearing arrived, the Relator had been effectively kept from his home

arrangement, the children were subjected to a legal free-for-all, with one parent 
ousted and silenced without any findings of fact. The trial court’s indifference to 
Relator’s emergency pleas and the Real Party’s self-help enforcement demonstrates 
an abdication of judicial responsibility warranting mandamus.

The climax of this procedural saga came on March 14, 2024. On that day, 
the court was finally set to hear Relator’s Emergency Motion (and other pending 
motions). Instead of a fair hearing, Relator was ambushed with a set of “Agreed 
Temporary Orders” moments before the proceeding. APP 1 Opposing counsel 
handed Relator a draft order purporting to memorialize the Feb. 1 settlement – but 
the terms diverged from what Relator had understood and never bore his signature 
or approval.  
On page 1, the orders claim that the court heard a motion that was never set 
for hearing APP 1.1, and misrepresent the February 1st, 2024, setting. There was 
no hearing on February 1st, 2024, as it was the second reset given the prior 
continuance granted by the Respondent on January 22, 2024.  In fact, Real Party 
only made one appearance in the entire case throughout four settings, and the 
Relator made two appearances. MR. 1 Just a cursory review of the docket sheet 
itself shows the glaring procedural abnormalities that should at the very least 
warrant investigation by this court.

The initial terms stated that Mr. Myers would remain in the home until 
March 1, 2024, yet on the orders handed to him, the dates changed, allowing Mr. 
Myers in the home until March 20, 2024, and Mrs. Myers to takeover on March 30, 
2024. APP 1.28 This left a 10-day window where the children would have been 
homeless and extended Mr. Myers’ time in the home which he had just been locked 
out of on March 6, 2024, by Mrs. Myers. 
 
The “hearing” was not meaningful in any way, as it resulted in the summary 
denial of Mr. Myers’ motion despite no response being given. This associate 
judge’s report containing the denial was prepared by the opposing counsel and was 
prepared prior to the start of the hearing. It can clearly be seen that the Associate 
Judge penciled in “for his business” on the order that was otherwise prepared by 
the opposing counsel. On line three, counsel for Mrs. Myers wrote “it is ordered 
that the parties shall present the temporary orders regarding the associate judge’s 
report signed 2/1/2024 by 1:30 PM today.” APP 2.1 
 
Now, if we defer back to the referenced agreement, it had stipulations set 
forth by the same judge. When taking those requirements, the clear abuse of 
discretion becomes apparent: 
1. The typed written order was prepared 30 business days after the date the 
report was signed, or 42 calendar days. 
2.  The report was not prepared by Dan Bacalis.

timely manner, which falls on the lack of prosecution exhibited by her legal 
representative, who has made no effort to participate in these proceedings. 
The constitutional dimension of this travesty cannot be overstated: fit 
parents have a fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and control of their 
children (Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 (2000); In re C.J.C., 603 S.W.3d 804, 
807 (Tex. 2020)). The law presumes that fit parents act in their child’s best interests 
and the State may not infringe on parental rights “simply because a judge believes 
a ‘better decision’ could be made”. Id. Yet Relator – an indisputably fit father with 
no findings against him – has been treated worse than an unfit parent: stripped of 
custody and even access to his children with no lawful basis. The March 14 orders 
epitomize the trial court’s disregard for Relator’s fundamental rights and the 
governing law. 
The orders here were plainly rendered as consent orders despite the 
undeniable absence of Relator’s genuine consent. Texas precedent firmly 
establishes that a court may not render a valid consent judgment unless consent 
exists at the very moment the court enters its judgment (Burnaman v. Heaton, 240 
S.W.2d 288, 291 (Tex. 1951)). Where, as here, consent was explicitly withdrawn 
and demonstrably coerced, the resulting orders are not merely voidable—they are 
void ab initio, representing an outright nullity under Texas law.

Without any evidence, testimony, or action by the opposing party, this case 
relies on the pleadings and procedure. Nobody opposes the relief sought here. 
Nobody argues with the points made here. The Court now stands at a critical 
juncture where its action—or inaction—will determine whether justice remains 
accessible to those who have been systematically denied it. Mr. Myers has 
exhausted every available legal avenue, meticulously following Texas law while 
being met with procedural roadblocks, judicial indifference, and per curiam denials 
that offer no explanation or remedy. 
The extraordinary circumstances of this case cry out for the extraordinary 
remedy of mandamus. From January 16, 2024, onward, the children went from 
having both parents in their daily lives to neither parent in their daily lives. At 
every turn – the normal safeguards of our legal system failed, leaving Relator with 
no adequate remedy except this Court’s intervention. Texas law does not permit a 
parent’s fundamental rights to be stripped away on an improvised, evidence-free 
basis, yet that is exactly what happened here. Relator’s relationship with his 
children hangs in the balance, and each day of unwarranted separation is harm that 
cannot be undone to his business and livelihood. 
A per curiam denial here will only result in the continuation of Mr. Myers’ 
perpetual journey for justice.

Rule 198: Requests for Admissions
RULE 198. REQUESTS FOR ADMISSIONS
198.1 Request for Admissions.
A party may serve on another party-no later than 30 days before the end of the discovery period-
written requests that the other party admit the truth of any matter within the scope of discovery,
including statements of opinion or of fact or of the application of law to fact, or the genuineness
of any documents served with the request or otherwise made available for inspection and copying.
Each matter for which an admission is requested must be stated separately.
198.2 Response to Requests for Admissions.
(a) Time for Response.
The responding party must serve a written response on the requesting party within 30 days after
service of the request, except that a defendant in a suit governed by the Family Code served with
a request before the defendant's answer is due need not respond until 50 days after service of the request.
(b) Content of Response.
Unless the responding party states an objection or asserts a privilege, the responding party must
specifically admit or deny the request or explain in detail the reasons that the responding party cannot
admit or deny the request. A response must fairly meet the substance of the request. The responding
party may qualify an answer, or deny a request in part, only when good faith requires. Lack of information
or knowledge is not a proper response unless the responding party states that a reasonable inquiry was made
but that the information known or easily obtainable is insufficient to enable the responding party to admit
or deny. An assertion that the request presents an issue for trial is not a proper response.
(c) Effect of Failure to Respond.
If a response is not timely served, the request is considered admitted without the necessity of a court order.
