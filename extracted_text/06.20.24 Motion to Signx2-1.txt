Vv. MOTION TO SIGN

Charles Dustin Myers,

Respondent

June 20th, 2024

To the Honorable 322"! District Court of Tarrant County, Texas:

The United States Constitution, Texas Constitution, Texas Family Code, Local
Rules of Tarrant County, Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, and the Texas Rules
of Civil Procedure all work in harmony to protect the rights and interests of citizens
residing within this State, forming a pyramid of protection.
A. The constitutional level

At the top of the pyramid — the United States Constitution and Texas
Constitution provide the highest level of protection, which safeguard citizens from the
deprivation of life, liberty, and property without due process of law. The Fifth and
Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution guarantee that no person

shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law (U.S. Const.

amends. V, XIV). Similarly, the Texas Constitution provides that no citizen of this State 
shall be deprived of life, liberty, property, privileges or immunities, or in any manner 
disfranchised, except by the due course of the law of the land (Tex. Const. art. I, § 19). 
Several cases handed down by this State’s highest court have also held that "Texas has 
long recognized that '[t]he natural right which exists between parents and their children is 
one of constitutional dimensions.” In re Y.B., 300 S.W.3d 1 (Tex. App. 2009)(quoting 
Wiley v. Spratlan, 543 S.W.2d 349, 352 (Tex.1976). 
B. The statutory level. 
However, these recent developments regarding parental rights have increasingly 
intertwined constitutional principles with the provisions of the next level of the pyramid - 
the Texas Family Code, which have blurred the lines between these once distinct levels of 
legal authority with the State’s heavy interest in the Children subject to its’ jurisdiction. 
The phrase "best interest of the child" is referenced 109 times throughout the Texas 
Family Code, and "the child’s best interest" appears 31 times. Notably, throughout all 
1,627 pages of the legislation, the word "always" appears only once, and is preceded by 
the word “shall”: 
“[t]he best interest of the child shall always be the primary consideration of the 
court  in determining the issues of conservatorship and possession of and access to the 
child.”  - Id § 153.002 (emphasis added) ; In re V.L.K., 24 S.W.3d 338, 342 (Tex. 2000); 
Villasenor v. Villasenor, 911 S.W.2d 411, 419 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 1995, no writ); 
In the Interest of H.R.H., No. 04-08-00538-CV (Tex. App. 4/15/2009) 
With such clear language on the face of the statute, this puts Judicial officers of 
this State in a position in which they “shall always” consider these interests in any 
determinations that they make regarding possession of and access to a child.

To meet this high statutory burden, "Courts employ the non-exhaustive list of Holley 
factors to determine the best interests of the children." In the Interest of H.R.H., No. 04-
08-00538-CV (Tex. App. 4/15/2009) (referencing Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367, 
371-72 (Tex. 1976) 
The factors include, but are not limited to: 
 (1) the desires of the child; (2) the emotional and physical needs of the child 
now and in the future; (3) the emotional and physical danger to the child now and in the 
future; (4) the parental abilities of the individuals seeking custody; (5) the programs 
available to assist these individuals to promote the best interest of the child; (6) the 
plans for the child by the individuals seeking custody; (7) the stability of the home or 
proposed placement; (8) the acts or omissions of the parent which may indicate that the 
existing parent-child relationship is not a proper one; and (9) any excuse for the acts or 
omissions of the parent. Id at 544 S.W.2d at 371-72  
C. Procedural and remedial statutory level 
In order to determine the factors needed to determine the best interest of the 
child, discovery must be completed in accordance with the procedural requirements set 
forth in the Texas Family Code, the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and the Texas Civil 
Practice and Remedies Code. These statutes collectively provide the necessary 
framework for conducting discovery, ensuring proper legal procedures are followed, 
and outlining available remedies if such procedures are not followed. 
D. Local procedural level 
At the base of the pyramid, the local procedural level, the Local Rules of 
Tarrant County provide speciﬁc guidelines and practices that must be adhered to 
in legal proceedings within the county. These rules ensure that court procedures 
are conducted efficiently and consistently, addressing the unique administrative
