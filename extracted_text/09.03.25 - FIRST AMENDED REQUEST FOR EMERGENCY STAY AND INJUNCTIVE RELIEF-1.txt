TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THIS COURT:
On June 23, 2025, Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, initiated suit against the

petitioner in this matter, Morgan Michelle Myers, and her stepfather, Daniel Kenneth
Branthoover of Yukon, Oklahoma, under the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act,

alleging 1) conduct 2) of an enterprise 3) through a pattern 4) of racketeering activity. Exhibit /

On August 28, 2025, an order signed by judge David L. Russell from the Western District
of Oklahoma was handed down, dismissing the case on the grounds that the continuity and
relatedness requirements were not satisfied, and the Respondent plans to appeal to the 10"
Circuit given that there is a circuit split amongst the Federal Courts regarding these elements.

Exhibit 2

The dismissal of the federal RICO case does not preclude the Respondent from raising
the same or similar factual allegations in Texas state court, particularly under Texas’s civil

racketeering statute, which provides for injunctive and other remedies to address racketeering

activity. The Respondent argues that this Court has both the authority and the responsibility to 
address the alleged racketeering conduct that resulted in the loss of his home, business, and 
children through an order rendered by this Court, and can use the federal court’s order to frame 
the legal and factual issues that have already been raised on the record in this suit.  
Given this case’s fact pattern, the ongoing Federal litigation, and despite the case being 
dismissed, the order demonstrates that Respondent’s claims are not frivolous and that there are 
substantial legal questions—especially given the circuit split on the interpretation of RICO’s 
relatedness and continuity elements—that warrant further consideration. The Respondent thereby 
requests that this Court take judicial notice of the federal proceedings, consider the potential 
impact of the federal appeal, and stay or dismiss this matter pending the outcome of the federal 
appellate process, thereby ensuring that the issues are fully and fairly adjudicated. 
By not doing so, this Court risks further complications, risks the appearance of partiality, 
and risks allowing criminal activity to influence its’ decisions. As stated from day one, this suit 
was initiated in bad faith, for alternate motives than the children’s best interest, and these 
allegations have been raised time and time again in this case, yet continue to be ignored. In light 
of the recent dismissal, this request is supported by the forthcoming facts: 
I. BACKGROUND AND RELEVANT LAW
1. Texas law provides a civil remedy for racketeering activity under Tex. Civ. Prac. &
Rem. Code § 140A.102, which authorizes courts to issue orders to prevent, restrain, and remedy 
racketeering, including injunctions, receiverships, constructive trusts, and asset preservation 
orders. This statute is designed to address racketeering activity in a civil context and is not 
limited by the outcome of a federal RICO action. The remedies available under Texas law are

broad and can be tailored to the specific circumstances of the case, including the deprivation of 
property or other interests resulting from racketeering. 
A. State Court Jurisdiction Over RICO Claims 
2. Texas courts have recognized that state and federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction 
over civil RICO claims, meaning that the dismissal of a federal RICO action does not bar a 
plaintiff from pursuing similar claims in state court (Main Rusk Associates v. Interior Space 
Constructors, Inc., 699 S.W.2d 305 (Tex. App. 1985)). This is significant because it allows the 
Respondent to reframe his claims under state law, even if the federal court found deficiencies 
under federal RICO standards. 
B. Pattern of Racketeering Activity: Relatedness and Continuity 
3. To establish a pattern of racketeering activity under both federal and Texas law, a 
plaintiff must show that the predicate acts are related and that they amount to or pose a threat of 
continued criminal activity (Birnbaum v. Law Offices of G. David Westfall, 120 S.W.3d 470 (Tex. 
App. 2003)). The relatedness prong requires that the acts have similar purposes, results, 
participants, victims, or methods, while the continuity prong can be satisfied by either a closed 
period of repeated conduct or an open-ended threat of future racketeering (Johnson v. Heath, 56 
F.4th 851 (10th Cir. 2022); H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229 (1989), as 
discussed in the secondary materials). 
4. The federal court in this case found that the Respondent failed to meet these 
requirements, primarily because the alleged scheme was directed at a single victim, had a single 
purpose, and was completed within a short period, with no threat of future racketeering. 
However, the court acknowledged that the interpretation of these requirements is fact-specific 
and that there is a split among the circuits regarding what constitutes sufficient relatedness and

Respondent to reframe his claims under state law, even if the federal court found deficiencies

B. Pattern of Racketeering Activity: Relatedness and Continuity

3. To establish a pattern of racketeering activity under both federal and Texas law, a
plaintiff must show that the predicate acts are related and that they amount to or pose a threat of
continued criminal activity (Birnbaum v. Law Offices of G. David Westfall, 120 S.W.3d 470 (Tex.
App. 2003)). The relatedness prong requires that the acts have similar purposes, results,
participants, victims, or methods, while the continuity prong can be satisfied by either a closed
period of repeated conduct or an open-ended threat of future racketeering (Johnson v. Heath, 56
F.4th 851 (10th Cir. 2022); HJ. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229 (1989), as

discussed in the secondary materials).

4. The federal court in this case found that the Respondent failed to meet these
requirements, primarily because the alleged scheme was directed at a single victim, had a single
purpose, and was completed within a short period, with no threat of future racketeering.
However, the court acknowledged that the interpretation of these requirements is fact-specific

and that there is a split among the circuits regarding what constitutes sufficient relatedness and

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
continuity (Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851 (10th Cir. 2022)). 
C. Standing and Injury
5. A plaintiff must also demonstrate standing by showing injury to business or property
caused by the alleged racketeering activity (Metzger v. Sebek, 892 S.W.2d 20 (Tex. App. 1994)). 
The federal court’s order and the underlying complaint provide a factual basis for such injury, 
including the loss of the plaintiff’s home, business, and children, which is ongoing. 
II. ANALYSIS
6. First, the order provides a detailed analysis of the factual and legal issues, including the
specific deficiencies identified by the federal court. The Respondent has already addressed these 
deficiencies in his pleadings, which have been ignored by the opposing side and the Court, 
despite properly bringing it to the Court’s attention several times through mandamus 
proceedings, motions, and recusal proceedings. The claims support the missing two elements that 
support the relatedness and continuity of the alleged racketeering activity, as required under 
Texas law (Birnbaum v. Law Offices of G. David Westfall, 120 S.W.3d 470 (Tex. App. 2003)). 
7. Second, the Respondent reasserts that this Court has a duty to address the alleged
racketeering activity, particularly given the broad remedial powers granted by Tex. Civ. Prac. & 
Rem. Code § 140A.102. The Respondent therefore requests injunctive relief to prevent further 
harm and to remedy the deprivation of his home, business, and children enabled by this Court. 
This Court is not bound by the federal court’s interpretation of RICO’s pattern requirements and 
may apply a different standard under Texas law, and the facts before it are more than plausible to 
substantiate the pattern requirement under RICO.

continuity (Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851 (10th Cir. 2022)).

C. Standing and Injury

8. Third, the Respondent hereby puts the state court on notice of the ongoing federal 
appeal and the circuit split regarding RICO’s relatedness and continuity requirements. The legal 
authorities recognize that courts have reached varying conclusions on these issues, and that the 
existence of a circuit split indicates that the law is unsettled. Therefore, the Court should either 
stay its proceedings or dismiss the case pending the outcome of the federal appeal, to avoid 
inconsistent rulings and to ensure that the issues are fully and fairly adjudicated, which up to this 
point they have not been. 
                                                       III. Framing the Argument 
9. The following points have no genuine dispute of their validity: 
i. 
Direct Injury: The direct injury to business and property, as required for 
standing under both federal and state law (Metzger v. Sebek, 892 S.W.2d 
20 (Tex. App. 1994)), continues and is ongoing. The abrupt removal from 
his home from the reliance on fraudulent pleadings has resulted in total 
losses exceeding $120,000 as of today, the evidence of such damages 
already plead in this case. Furthermore, Petitioner continues to dispose of 
Respondent’s personal property in defiance of the, albeit fraudulent, court 
order currently in place. 
ii. 
Pattern of Racketeering Activity: The Federal Court’s dismissal rested 
on the assumption that the enterprise ceased functioning on January 16, 
2024, the day this Court effectuated the abrupt removal of the Respondent 
from his home, business, and children. The Respondent, as already argued, 
reasserts that the acts were not isolated, but part of a broader scheme with

similar purposes, results, and participants (Birnbaum v. Law Offices of G. 
David Westfall, 120 S.W.3d 470 (Tex. App. 2003) 
9. It is noteworthy that three days after initiating the RICO suit against the Petitioner, her
boyfriend, Damen Kazlauskas, reached out via text message and threatened bodily harm to the 
Respondent in retaliation to pursuing relief against the criminal enterprise of Morgan Michelle 
Myers and Daniel Kenneth Branthoover. 
IV. CONCLUSION
10. The Respondent has already provided sufficient factual detail to support a prima facie
case to this Court, meaning enough evidence to support a rational inference that the alleged facts 
are true (Sullo v. Kubosh, 616 S.W.3d 869 (Tex. App. 2020)). Taken together with the recent 
order from the Federal Court, this judicial body has a duty to address these issues to prevent any 
further harm by the Petitioner’s criminal activity, whether through a hearing sua sponte, as this 
Court has shown is willing to do, or through a stay of the proceedings until the 10th Circuit 
decides the appeal. 
11. Proceeding to final trial under these circumstances, especially when taken together
with the fact pattern of this case, would be a manifest injustice, and the Respondent will pursue 
all legal avenues to prevent the permanent loss of his fundamental rights.

III. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
11. At the heart of this litigation lies a deliberate and orchestrated scheme by 
Defendants Morgan Michelle Myers and Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, who strategically 
chose to displace Plaintiff from his home and destabilize his financial and familial 
security. Branthoover administered and Myers meticulously executed a calculated plan 
involving interstate travel, fraudulent affidavits, deliberate petjury, asset diversion, and 
systematic manipulation of multiple Texas state courts to escape accountability for her 
actions. 
12. To carry out this scheme, Myers enlisted the assistance of Daniel Kenneth 
Branthoover, a resident of Yukon Oklahoma, who has a prior history regarding violations 
of protective orders and tampering with government documents. For no other reason than 
to escape accountability for her affair, Myers spun an elaborate web of lies and 
weaponized her family and court procedures designed to help victims of abuse. 
13. What emerges from the evidence is not a domestic dispute gone awry, but a 
textbook criminal enterprise created within this Court's Jurisdiction. This is the story of 
how a person corruptly influenced the very courts designed to protect families-
transforming them into instruments of fraud, extortion, and systematic theft. It is a tale of 
how two individuals, connected by a common goal, orchestrated a seventeen-month reign 
of terror that began in Oklahoma and was carried out in the Texas courts.

Il, PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

11. At the heart of this litigation lies a deliberate and orchestrated scheme by
Defendants Morgan Michelle Myers and Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, who strategically
chose to displace Plaintiff from his home and destabilize his financial and familial
security. Branthoover administered and Myers meticulously executed a calculated plan
involving interstate travel, fraudulent affidavits, deliberate perjury, asset diversion, and
systematic manipulation of multiple Texas state courts to escape accountability for her
actions.

12. To carry out this scheme, Myers enlisted the assistance of Daniel Kenneth
Branthoover, a resident of Yukon Oklahoma, who has a prior history regarding violations
of protective orders and tampering with government documents. For no other reason than
to escape accountability for her affair, Myers spun an elaborate web of lies and
weaponized her family and court procedures designed to help victims of abuse.

13. What emerges from the evidence is not a domestic dispute gone awry, but a
textbook criminal enterprise created within this Court’s Jurisdiction. This is the story of
how a person corruptly influenced the very courts designed to protect families—
transforming them into instruments of fraud, extortion, and systematic theft. It is a tale of
how two individuals, connected by a common goal, orchestrated a seventeen-month reign
of terror that began in Oklahoma and was carried out in the Texas courts.

14. The Defendants did not merely lie to courts—they constructed an elaborate
criminal enterprise with defined roles, coordinated operations, and a singular mission: to

strip Plaintiff of everything he held dear through the systematic corruption of judicial

proceedings. They engaged in laundering funds across state lines while concurrently 
submitting fraudulent indigency claims. They did not just fabricate allegations-they 
manufactured an entire false narrative of domestic violence, complete with non-existent 
protective orders and imaginary threats, all while the supposed "victim" continued to 
share a bed with her alleged "abuser." 
15. This case shows how the family court system can be perverted by those willing 
to commit federal crimes to achieve their goals. It reveals how easily the sacred trust 
placed in sworn affidavits can be shattered by defendants who view perjury not as a 
crime, but as a tool. Most importantly, it demonstrates that when domestic relations 
become the vehicle for interstate racketeering, federal intervention is not just 
appropriate-it is essential. 
16. This is not a story about a marriage that failed. This is simply the product of a 
litigant who values her extramarital relationships over morality, and who chose to 
weaponize her family against Plaintiff for the sole purpose of escaping accountability. 
17. After extensive research and vigorous advocacy, Plaintiff asserts that 
Defendants engaged in racketeering activity through an organized enterprise, seeking 
relief to prevent its finalization. Against all odds, and in support of this preliminruy 
statement, Plaintiff alleges the following:

IV. FACTUALALLEGATIONS 
A. Enterprise Formation and Initial Criminal Coordination (December 14-15, 2023) 
18. Defendant Branthoover possesses extensive knowledge of protective order 
procedmes and requirements due to his prior criminal convictions involving violations of 
such orders. This knowledge would prove instrumental in the enterprise's systematic 
manipulation of protective order proceedings. 
19. On December 14, 2023, immediately following Plaintiffs discovery of 
Defendant Myers' extramarital affair, she initiated the criminal enterprise by taking two 
coordinated actions: first, she opened a private bank account in her sole name to facilitate 
asset concealment; and second, she commenced intensive interstate communications with 
Defendant Branthoover via text messaging. The scope and intensity of these 
communications-totaling 92 text messages exchanged between Branthoover's registered 
number 940-312-3434 and Myers' registered number 817-235-5189 on this single day-
demonstrates the deliberate and coordinated nature of their criminal planning. 
20. While coordinating with Branthoover, Defendant Myers tried to secure an ex-
parte protective order against Plaintiff, without legitimate cause. This action marks the 
enterprise's first attempt to manipulate judicial proceedings through false allegations. 
21. Despite having just sought emergency protection from Plaintiff hours earlier, 
Myers casually reminded him of their child's school field trip scheduled for the following 
day, thereby creating a facade of normalcy designed to conceal her fraudulent intentions 
and prevent suspicion of the enterprise's activities.

B. Interstate Criminal Coordination and Financial Crimes (December 15-16, 2023) 
22. On December 15, 2023, at precisely 9:51 A.M. CST, Defendant Branthoover 
contacted Plaintiff directly, employing calculated deception by stating, "I've been where 
you are before. I want to help both of you." This communication, referencing Myers' 
December 1, 2023 divorce announcement, was designed to establish false pretenses for 
Myers' planned interstate travel to Oklahoma for criminal coordination purposes. 
23. During this deceptive phone conversation, Branthoover established the 
operational framework for the next phase of the criminal scheme by atl'anging for Myers 
to visit his Oklahoma residence over the weekend of December 15, 2023. The stated 
purpose-"providing space" to Myers-was a deliberate misrepresentation designed to 
conceal the true criminal purpose of coordinating fraudulent document preparation and 
enterprise operations. 
24. Having no reason to suspect Branthoover's dishonest intentions, Plaintiff 
unwittingly facilitated the enterprise's criminal coordination by agreeing to Myers' travel 
to Oklahoma. 
25. Immediately following Branthoover's deceptive phone call, the enterprise 
executed its first major financial crime. Plaintiff received notification that Myers had 
transfetl'ed $1,576 from the parties' joint marital PNC account to Branthoover's Pay Pal 
account (usemame "dmb575"), completely depleting the account balance. This interstate 
wire transfer represents a critical predicate act, utilizing interstate commerce to further 
the criminal scheme while simultaneously depriving Plaintiff of operating funds 
necessary for his legitimate business operations, household bills, and Christmas gifts.

26. The immediate and devastating impact of this financial crime became apparent 
on December 16, 2023, when Plaintiff received notification that the joint marital PNC 
account was overdrawn by $800.00. Concurrently, Plaintiff discovered that 
advertisements for his legitimate home-based business had ceased running due to 
payment failure directly caused by the enterprise's theft of operating funds. This 
demonstrates the enterprise's deliberate intent to cause maximum financial harm to 
Plaintiff. 
27. The criminal nature of this financial transaction is conclusively established by 
documentary evidence. The PNC bank statement for December 2023 provides irrefutable 
proof of the unauthorized withdrawal, documenting the precise date, amount, and 
destination of the :fraudulent transfer. 
28. The direct connection between Defendant Branthoover and this financial crime 
is established through multiple forms of evidence. The PayPal identifier "dmb575" 
appearing on Plaintiffs bank statement directly corresponds to Branthoover's Pay Pal 
account, creating an unbreakable evidentiary chain linking him to the illicit financial 
transaction, c01Toborated by his own admissions in subsequent text communications. 
29. On December 16, 2023, at precisely 3:54 P.M. CST, Plaintiff made a good-
faith attempt to resolve the situation amicably by sending a detailed text message to 
Defendant Branthoover. This communication explicitly requested the return of the 
fraudulently transferred $1,576, detailed the intended legitimate use of these funds, 
described the financial hardship caused by the theft (including late bills and business 
disruption), explained Plaintiff's inability to work due to the severe emotional distress

caused by Defendants' criminal actions, and expressed his sincere desire for an amicable 
resolution during the holiday season. 
30. Defendant Branthoover's response to this reasonable request revealed the true 
criminal nature of the enterprise. In a callous and dismissive reply, Branthoover stated, 
"You Are Getting Divorced ... " followed by, "I hope I can help with the paperwork and 
make things go as smoothly as possible." Far from the helpful assistance initially 
promised, this communication constituted a direct threat and overt act in furtherance of 
the criminal conspiracy, demonstrating Branthoover's intent to exploit Plaintiffs financial 
distress for the enterprise's benefit while utilizing interstate communications to further the 
scheme. 
31. This communication also establishes Branthoover's unauthorized practice of 
law across state lines. At no time relevant to this litigation has Defendant Branthoover 
possessed a license to practice law in any jurisdiction within the United States. His 
statements regarding "paperwork" and making legal proceedings "go as smoothly as 
possible" constitute clear evidence of unauthorized legal practice and demonstrate his 
administrative role in directing the enterprise's criminal activities.

The assertion that "Granddaughter getting divorced," referring to 
Defendant Myers, as a basis for eviction; 
iii. 
The false claim that a "Protective order has been filed." 
1v. 
The directive that "He must leave. She and the girls may stay," 
demonstrating the clear intent to dispossess Plaintiff for the benefit 
ofMyers. 
33. The coordinated and premeditated nature of this eviction fraud is established 
by the timing of its execution. At the precise moment this fraudulent notice was being 
served in Texas, Defendant Myers was physically present in Oklahoma with Defendant 
Branthoover, actively collaborating in the preparation of the very fraudulent court 
documents referenced in the eviction notice. 
34. Myers' knowledge of the fraudulent nature of the eviction attempt is 
conclusively established. She possessed actual knowledge that no valid lease agreement 
existed, and she had actual knowledge that neither divorce proceedings nor protective 
orders had been filed at the time of service, making her participation in the eviction fraud 
a knowing and willful criminal act. 
35. On December 17, 2023, Defendant Myers completed the interstate 
transportation phase of the criminal scheme by transporting the fraudulent court 
documents prepared in Oklahoma back across state lines to Texas. These documents, 
including the Original Petition for Divorce and Affidavit oflndigency, were specifically

fraudulent manipulation of judicial proceedings. 
36. Upon her return to Texas, Myers demonstrated her control over the eviction 
fraud by personally destroying the fraudulent eviction notice. She physically tore the 
notice in half and wrote "VOID" on it in black marker, providing clear evidence of her 
influence over and coordination of the fraudulent eviction attempt orchestrated during her 
absence in Oklahoma. 
D. Operational Security and Document Preparation (December 17-18, 2023) 
37. As part of the enterprise's operational security measures, Defendant Myers 
returned from Oklahoma equipped with a canister of pepper spray, designed to support 
the false narrative of domestic violence that would be central to the fraudulent comt 
documents prepared during her Oklahoma visit. 
38. During her Oklahoma visit, Defendant Myers acquired a secondary phone 
number (817-940-0852) as a deliberate operational security measure. This acquisition, 
which she explicitly disclosed to Plaintiff, constituted an overt act in furtherance of the 
criminal enterprise, designed to facilitate clandestine communications related to the 
fraudulent scheme while concealing the enterprise's ongoing criminal coordination from 
detection. 
39. This newly acquired secondary phone number became an integral component 
of the fraudulent court documents prepared under Defendant Branthoover's direct 
administrative oversight. The systematic use of this number across multiple fraudulent 
legal documents demonstrates the coordinated nature of the enterprise's document

This communication was a deliberate attempt to isolate Plaintiff from direct 
communication with Myers and to control the flow of information, thereby hindering 
Plaintiff's ability to uncover the full extent of the fraudulent scheme. This communication 
also evidences that Branthoover's role went beyond helping Myers prepare the 
documents by seeing them through to their submission and asserting an administrative 
role over the proceedings to intimidate Plaintiff. 
F. Service Through Official Channels and Continued Deception (December 22-28, 
2023) 
41. In furtherance of the criminal scheme, and despite continuing to cohabitate 
with Plaintiff in the marital residence, Defendant Myers deliberately utilized official 
constable service to effectuate service of the fraudulent divorce petition and protective 
order application, which occurred on December 27, 2023. This calculated use of official 
legal processes to serve fraudulent documents while maintaining the deceptive facade of 
normalcy at home demonstrates the sophisticated and deliberate nature of the enterprise's 
operations. 
42. The enterprise's manipulation of official legal processes continued when 
Myers, despite residing next door to Plaintiff, deliberately influenced and coordinated the 
constable service of the fraudulent eviction documents, which occurred on December 28, 
2023. This systematic abuse of official legal processes while maintaining physical 
proximity and continued cohabitation reveals the calculated and deceptive nature of the 
enterprise's operations.

This communication was a deliberate attempt to isolate Plaintiff from direct
communication with Myers and to control the flow of information, thereby hindering
Plaintiff’s ability to uncover the full extent of the fraudulent scheme. This communication
also evidences that Branthoover’s role went beyond helping Myers prepare the
documents by seeing them through to their submission and asserting an administrative
role over the proceedings to intimidate Plaintiff.

F. Service Through Official Channels and Continued Deception (December 22-28,

Myers, despite residing next door to Plaintiff, deliberately influenced and coordinated the
constable service of the fraudulent eviction documents, which occurred on December 28,
2023. This systematic abuse of official legal processes while maintaining physical

G. Systematic False Statements in Sworn Court Documents (December 18, 2023) 
43. When reviewing the documents prepared in part by Branthoover and filed with 
the court by Myers, there existed several false statements and were intended to deceive 
the court and prejudice Plaintiff in furtherance of the scheme to dispose him of his 
property interests. Specifically, these false statements included, but were not limited to: 
1. 
The assertion that the spouses had ceased living together on 
December 1, 2023, when in fact they were still residing together at 
the marital home on that date and for several weeks thereafter.

The claim that Defendant Myers owned both family vehicles as her 
separate property prior to the marriage, which was demonstrably 
false as these vehicles were acquired during the marriage and 
constituted community property, paid for by Plaintiff.

The representation that Defendant Myers had an active order of 
protection against Plaintiff with a judicial finding that family 
violence had occurred during the marriage, which was fabricated and 
without any basis in fact or law.

The assertion that the children or Defendant Myers would be 
subjected to harassment or abuse if Plaintiff were provided with her 
second phone number (817-940-0852) acquired in Oklahoma, which 
was a baseless and manipulative claim designed to conceal her

46. Upon review, defendant Myers made additional false statements within the 
sworn document, all intended to further deceive the court and secure an unwarranted 
protective order against Plaintiff to effectuate the enterprises' goal of divesting him of his 
property interests. These false statements included, but were not limited to:

V. INTRODUCTION TO RICO 
55. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in 
paragraphs 1 through 54 above, as if fully set forth herein. 
56. The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) requires 
proof of a "pattern of racketeering activity," which the Supreme Court has consistently 
held consists of two essential elements: relatedness and continuity of predicate acts. 
Based on the provided facts and the applicable law, the Defendants' series of related acts 
spanning from December 2023 through May 2025 (approximately 18 months) satisfies 
both the relatedness requirement ( as the acts share similar purposes, participants, and 
methods) and the continuity requirement (as they extend over a substantial period of 
time) necessary to establish a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO as explained in 
more detail below. 
57. For there to be a pattern of racketeering activity, there must be conduct 
committed by an enterprise that is prohibited under 18 U.S.C. § 1961. In the instant 
matter, Defendants are alleged to have committed several predicate acts, including wire 
fraud, violations of the Travel Act, and perjury/subordination of perjury to support a 
pattern of racketeering activity, as explained in more detail below.

60. Title 18 U.S.C. § 1343 states: 
"Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for 
obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, 
or promises, transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television 
communication in interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, 
or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined under this 
title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both." 
61. The facts above establish all three elements of wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 
1343-a scheme to defraud, use of interstate wire communications, and intent to deprive 
another of money or property-qualifying it as a RICO predicate act under 18 U.S.C. § 
1961. 
A. Scheme to Defraud 
62. The first element of wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 is the existence of "a 
scheme to defraud." As noted in United States v. Greenberg, 835 F.3d 295 (2nd Cir. 
2016), this constitutes an "essential element" of the crime. In the present case, Myers 
transferred $1,576 from a joint marital PNC account to Branthoover's PayPal account, 
depleting the account entirely. This transfer was not an isolated action but was 
accompanied by "a series of coordinated text messages and phone calls" between Myers 
and Branthoover regarding the scheme, and followed after a deceptive message was sent 
from Branthoover to Plaintiff. 
63. The coordination between the parties through multiple communications 
channels demonstrates a deliberate plan rather than a spontaneous or inadvertent action. 
As a1ticulated in Mail and Wire Fraud, a "scheme to defraud requires a material 
falsehood, material misrepresentation, or the concealment of a material fact." By

60. Title 18 U.S.C. § 1343 states:

"Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for
obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations,
or promises, transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television
communication in interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures,
or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined under this
title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both."

61. The facts above establish all three elements of wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. §
1343—a scheme to defraud, use of interstate wire communications, and intent to deprive
another of money or property—qualifying it as a RICO predicate act under 18 U.S.C. §
1961.

A. Scheme to Defraud

62. The first element of wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 is the existence of "a
scheme to defraud." As noted in United States v. Greenberg, 835 F.3d 295 (2nd Cir.
2016), this constitutes an "essential element" of the crime. In the present case, Myers
transferred $1,576 from a joint marital PNC account to Branthoover's PayPal account,
depleting the account entirely. This transfer was not an isolated action but was
accompanied by "a series of coordinated text messages and phone calls" between Myers
and Branthoover regarding the scheme, and followed after a deceptive message was sent
from Branthoover to Plaintiff.

63. The coordination between the parties through multiple communications
channels demonstrates a deliberate plan rather than a spontaneous or inadvertent action.

As articulated in Mail and Wire Fraud, a "scheme to defraud requires a material

falsehood, material misrepresentation, or the concealment of a material fact." By

transferring funds from a joint marital account without apparent authorization from the 
joint account holder, Myers engaged in conduct that reflects the concealment of material 
facts regarding the disposition of marital assets. 
64. The scheme in this case specifically targeted marital funds, and community 
property, which are legally considered shared property between spouses. By depleting the 
account, Myers intentionally deprived the Plaintiff of access to funds to which he was 
legally entitled. This satisfies the requirement that the scheme have "money or property 
as the object of the scheme" as stated in Smulley v. Fed Haus. Fin. Agency, 17-2666 (2nd 
Cir. Oct 05, 2018). 
B. Use of Interstate Wire Communications 
65. The second element of wire fraud requires the "use of the mails or wires to 
further the scheme." United States v. Greenberg, 835 F.3d 295 (2nd Cir. 2016). The facts 
demonstrate that Myers used interstate wire communications in two distinct ways: 
1. 
The transfer of $1,576 was "executed via interstate wire (bank to 
Pay Pal)," which constitutes an electronic transmission across state 
lines. 
11. 
The transfer "was accompanied by a series of coordinated text 
messages and phone calls between Myers (in Texas) and 
Branthoover (in Oklahoma) regarding the scheme." 
66. Wire transmissions include interstate telephone calls or electronic 
transmissions. Furthermore, internet communications satisfy the interstate nexus

transferring funds from a joint marital account without apparent authorization from the
joint account holder, Myers engaged in conduct that reflects the concealment of material
facts regarding the disposition of marital assets.

64. The scheme in this case specifically targeted marital funds, and community
property, which are legally considered shared property between spouses. By depleting the
account, Myers intentionally deprived the Plaintiff of access to funds to which he was
legally entitled. This satisfies the requirement that the scheme have "money or property
as the object of the scheme" as stated in Smulley v. Fed. Hous. Fin. Agency, 17-2666 (2nd
Cir. Oct 05, 2018).

B. Use of Interstate Wire Communications

65. The second element of wire fraud requires the "use of the mails or wires to
further the scheme." United States v. Greenberg, 835 F.3d 295 (2nd Cir. 2016). The facts
demonstrate that Myers used interstate wire communications in two distinct ways:

i, The transfer of $1,576 was "executed via interstate wire (bank to
PayPal)," which constitutes an electronic transmission across state
lines.

ii. The transfer "was accompanied by a series of coordinated text
messages and phone calls between Myers (in Texas) and
Branthoover (in Oklahoma) regarding the scheme."

66. Wire transmissions include interstate telephone calls or electronic

transmissions. Furthermore, internet communications satisfy the interstate nexus

requirement, even in the absence of proof that a fraudulent communication traveled 
through out-of-state servers. 
67. The interstate nature of these communications is established by the fact that 
Myers was in Texas while Branthoover was in Oklahoma during their communications 
about the scheme. This satisfies the jurisdictional requirement that the wire 
communication cross state lines. 
C. Intend to Defraud 
68. The third element requires that the defendant acted "with the intent to 
defraud." As stated in US. v. Blackmon, 839 F.2d 900 (2nd Cir. 1988), the wire fraud 
statute requires that the defendant "be a party to some kind of scheme to defraud, a 
requirement that includes a high degree of scienter and moral culpability." 
69. Here, Branthoover specifically stated that he wanted to help Plaintiff, which he 
knew was not a true statement at the time. The fact that text and phone communications 
were used to deceive Plaintiff into believing that Myers' interstate travel would be 
beneficial for him further supports a scheme to defraud, because the transfer of funds 
occmTed after this false extension of help from Branthoover. 
70. In summary, the facts presented establish all required elements of wire fraud 
under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, qualifying it as a predicate act for RICO purposes under 18 
U.S.C. § 1961, committed by both Defendants. 
D. Potential Defenses 
71. One potential defense might be that Myers, as a joint account holder, had legal 
authority to transfer funds from the account. However, this authority does not extend to

requirement, even in the absence of proof that a fraudulent communication traveled
through out-of-state servers.

67. The interstate nature of these communications is established by the fact that
Myers was in Texas while Branthoover was in Oklahoma during their communications
about the scheme. This satisfies the jurisdictional requirement that the wire
communication cross state lines.

C. Intend to Defraud

68. The third element requires that the defendant acted "with the intent to
defraud." As stated in U.S. v. Blackmon, 839 F.2d 900 (2nd Cir. 1988), the wire fraud
statute requires that the defendant "be a party to some kind of scheme to defraud, a
requirement that includes a high degree of scienter and moral culpability."

69. Here, Branthoover specifically stated that he wanted to help Plaintiff, which he
knew was not a true statement at the time. The fact that text and phone communications
were used to deceive Plaintiff into believing that Myers’ interstate travel would be
beneficial for him further supports a scheme to defraud, because the transfer of funds
occurred after this false extension of help from Branthoover.

70. In summary, the facts presented establish all required elements of wire fraud
under 18 U.S.C. § 1343, qualifying it as a predicate act for RICO purposes under 18
U.S.C. § 1961, committed by both Defendants.

D. Potential Defenses
71. One potential defense might be that Myers, as a joint account holder, had legal

authority to transfer funds from the account. However, this authority does not extend to

depleting the account for personal gain in coordination with a third party with the intent 
to deprive the other account holder of their rightful access to the funds. The joint nature 
of the account creates a fiduciary duty to act in good faith regarding the shared asset. That 
fiduciary duty was willingly violated when Myers chose to transfer the funds to 
Branthoover's Pay Pal, and then later to herself. The appropriate method would have been 
for Myers to transfer the funds directly to herself, but she avoided this to conceal her 
bank account information in furtherance of a broader scheme. 
72. This argument fails because the proceeds from the transfer were used to 
acquire a second phone in furtherance of the broader scheme. 
VII. PREDICATE ACT- VIOLATION OF THE TRAVEL ACT (18 U.S.C. § 1952) 
73. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in 
paragraphs 1 through 72 above, as if fully set forth herein. 
74. The Travel Act, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1952, criminalizes interstate travel or 
the use of interstate facilities with the intent to promote, manage, establish, carry on, or 
facilitate unlawful activity, followed by the performance or attempted performance of 
such acts. According to 18 U.S.C. § 1952: 
"Whoever travels in interstate or foreign commerce or uses the mail or any facility 
in interstate or foreign commerce, with intent to- ... otherwise promote, manage, 
establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion, management, establishment, or can-ying 
on, of any unlawful activity, and thereafter performs or attempts to perform- ... an act 
described in paragraph or shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 5 
years, or both ... " 
75. The statute has three essential elements:

Interstate travel or use of interstate facilities

depleting the account for personal gain in coordination with a third party with the intent
to deprive the other account holder of their rightful access to the funds. The joint nature
of the account creates a fiduciary duty to act in good faith regarding the shared asset. That
fiduciary duty was willingly violated when Myers chose to transfer the funds to
Branthoover’s PayPal, and then later to herself. The appropriate method would have been
for Myers to transfer the funds directly to herself, but she avoided this to conceal her
bank account information in furtherance of a broader scheme.

72. This argument fails because the proceeds from the transfer were used to
acquire a second phone in furtherance of the broader scheme.

VII. PREDICATE ACT — VIOLATION OF THE TRAVEL ACT (18 U.S.C. § 1952)

73. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in
paragraphs 1 through 72 above, as if fully set forth herein.

74. The Travel Act, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1952, criminalizes interstate travel or
the use of interstate facilities with the intent to promote, manage, establish, carry on, or
facilitate unlawful activity, followed by the performance or attempted performance of
such acts. According to 18 U.S.C. § 1952:

"Whoever travels in interstate or foreign commerce or uses the mail or any facility
in interstate or foreign commerce, with intent to- ... otherwise promote, manage,
establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion, management, establishment, or carrying
on, of any unlawful activity, and thereafter performs or attempts to perform- ... an act
described in paragraph or shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 5
years, or both..."

75. The statute has three essential elements:

i, Interstate travel or use of interstate facilities

ii. 
Intent to promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate unlawful 
activity 
iii. 
Subsequent performance or attempted performance of acts in 
fmtherance of the unlawful activity 
76. For a Travel Act violation to serve as a RICO predicate act, it must be 
"indictable" under 18 U.S.C. § 1952. Myers' conduct, as analyzed above, satisfies all 
elements of a Travel Act violation: 
1. 
Myers engaged in interstate travel between Texas and Oklahoma. 
11. 
Myers traveled with the specific intent to coordinate the preparation 
of fraudulent court documents and execute a criminal scheme. 
Under United States v. Compton, 355 F.2d 872 (6th Cir. 1966), this 
intent can be inferred from "evidence of a substantial course of 
illegal conduct, occurring a reasonable time before and after an act 
of interstate travel." The preparation of fraudulent court documents 
falls within the definition of "unlawful activity" under the Travel 
Act, as it involves fraud, which is indictable under state law. 
iii. 
After the interstate travel, Myers engaged in overt acts to fu1ther the 
unlawful activity by preparing fraudulent legal documents and 
coordinating the fraudulent scheme. As U.S. v. Admon, 940 F.2d 
1121 (8th Cir. 1991) clarified, the conduct after travel need not itself 
be unlawful but must further the unlawful activity. The preparation 
and use of fraudulent documents clearly meet this requirement.

76. For a Travel Act violation to serve as a RICO predicate act, it must be

"indictable" under 18 U.S.C. § 1952. Myers' conduct, as analyzed above, satisfies all

elements of a Travel Act violation:

ili.

Myers engaged in interstate travel between Texas and Oklahoma.
Myers traveled with the specific intent to coordinate the preparation
of fraudulent court documents and execute a criminal scheme.
Under United States v. Compton, 355 F.2d 872 (6th Cir. 1966), this
intent can be inferred from "evidence of a substantial course of
illegal conduct, occurring a reasonable time before and after an act
of interstate travel." The preparation of fraudulent court documents
falls within the definition of "unlawful activity" under the Travel
Act, as it involves fraud, which is indictable under state law.

After the interstate travel, Myers engaged in overt acts to further the
unlawful activity by preparing fraudulent legal documents and
coordinating the fraudulent scheme. As U.S. v. Admon, 940 F.2d
1121 (8th Cir, 1991) clarified, the conduct after travel need not itself
be unlawful but must further the unlawful activity. The preparation

77. Given that Myers' conduct satisfies all elements of a Travel Act violation, this 
violation qualifies as an "indictable" offense under 18 U.S.C. § 1952. As such, it 
constitutes a valid predicate act for RICO purposes under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). 
78. The Supreme Court's explanation in Perrin v. United States, 444 U.S. 37 
( 1979) that the Travel Act was intended to provide "a second layer of enforcement" for 
interstate criminal activity underscores the significance of federalizing crimes that cross 
state lines. Myers' conduct, involving interstate travel for the purpose of engaging in 
fraudulent activities, is precisely the type of behavior that the Travel Act was designed to 
address. 
VIII. PATTERN OF RACKETEERING ACTIVITY 
79. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in 
paragraphs 1 through 78 above, as if fully set forth herein. 
80. A "pattern of racketeering activity" requires at least two acts of "racketeering 
activity" occun'ing within a ten-year period. 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (2025) ('"pattern of 
racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which 
occwTed after the effective date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten 
years ( excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of 
racketeering activity"). 
81. However, the mere existence of two predicate acts is not automatically 
sufficient to establish a pattern. As explained in Bonton v. Archer Chrysler Plymouth, 
Inc., 889 F.Supp. 995 (S.D. Tex. 1995):

violation qualifies as an "indictable" offense under 18 U.S.C. § 1952. As such, it
constitutes a valid predicate act for RICO purposes under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1).

78. The Supreme Court's explanation in Perrin v. United States, 444 US. 37

VIII. PATTERN OF RACKETEERING ACTIVITY

79. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in
paragraphs 1 through 78 above, as if fully set forth herein.

80. A "pattern of racketeering activity" requires at least two acts of "racketeering
activity" occurring within a ten-year period. 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (2025) (pattern of
racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which
occurred after the effective date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten
years (excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of
racketeering activity").

81. However, the mere existence of two predicate acts is not automatically
sufficient to establish a pattern. As explained in Bonton v. Archer Chrysler Plymouth,

Inc., 889 F.Supp. 995 (8.D. Tex. 1995):

"Although at least two acts of racketeering are necessary to constitute a pattern, two acts 
may not be sufficient. Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479,496 n. 14, 105 S.Ct.

1. 
The extensive text message communications (92 exchanges)

using interstate wire facilities to coordinate their scheme. 
11. 
Branthoover's deceptive phone call to Plaintiff on December 
15, 2023, where he falsely stated, "I've been where you are 
before. I want to help both of you," to facilitate Myers' 
interstate travel to Oklahoma.

11. 
Open-ended Continuity: The scheme also poses a threat of continued 
criminal activity. Branthoover's message on May 24, 2025, 
demonstrating continued monitoring of Plaintiffs activities and 
threatening future retaliation, indicates that the racketeering activity 
could continue indefinitely given that they are unable to finalize the 
divorce. This satisfies the alternative requirement for "a threat of 
continuing criminal activity extending indefinitely into the future" 
noted in RICO: A Primer (2022). 
D. Role of Perjury and Subornation of Perjury 
87. While perjury and subornation of perjury in state court proceedings are not 
themselves listed as predicate acts under RICO, they form an integral part of the overall 
criminal scheme and help establish the pattern of racketeering activity when considered 
alongside the actual predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations. 
88. As explained in RICO: A Primer (2022), racketeering acts need not be similar 
or directly related to each other; they must simply be "related in some way to the affairs 
of the charged enterprise." The perjury and subornation of perjury evident in the 
fraudulent court filings- including the false statements in the divorce petition, the 
Affidavit oflndigency, and the Application for Protective Order-are directly related to 
the predicate acts of wire fraud and Travel Act violations. They share the same purpose, 
involve the same participants, target the same victim, and form part of the same overall 
scheme. For example:

enterprise between Myers and Branthoover that satisfies the definition in 18 U.S.C. § 
1961 (2025). 
i. 
Myers and Branthoover associated for the common purpose of

legal proceedings. This shared objective is evident from their 
coordinated actions beginning on December 14, 2023, immediately 
following Plaintiffs discovery of Myers' affair. 
ii. 
Though informal, the enterprise had a clear 
organizational structure as 1) Myers acted as the "inside" operative, 
with direct access to marital assets and the ability to file fraudulent 
court documents in Texas. 2) Branthoover served as the "outside" 
operative, providing administrative oversight, expertise on protective 
orders due to his prior criminal history (Paragraph 18), and a base of 
operations in Oklahoma. 3) Their respective roles complemented 
each other and demonstrated an organized approach to their criminal 
scheme. 
iii. 
The enterprise functioned as a continuing unit from December 2023 
through May 2025, with consistent roles and coordinated 
actions throughout this period.

depriving Plaintiff of his property rights through the manipulation of
legal proceedings. This shared objective is evident from their
coordinated actions beginning on December 14, 2023, immediately
following Plaintiff's discovery of Myers' affair.

Though informal, the enterprise had a clear

organizational structure as 1) Myers acted as the "inside" operative,
with direct access to marital assets and the ability to file fraudulent
court documents in Texas. 2) Branthoover served as the "outside"
operative, providing administrative oversight, expertise on protective
orders due to his prior criminal history (Paragraph 18), and a base of
operations in Oklahoma. 3) Their respective roles complemented
each other and demonstrated an organized approach to their criminal
scheme.

The enterprise functioned as a continuing unit from December 2023
through May 2025, with consistent roles and coordinated

actions throughout this period.

B. Maintenance of the Enterprise 
92. The enterprise was maintained through several key mechanisms: 
1. 
Continuous Communication: Myers and Branthoover 
maintained regular interstate communications throughout the 
scheme, beginning with the 92 text messages on December 14, 
2023, and continuing through May 2025. 
11. 
Financial Support: The interstate wire transfer of $1,576 from 
the joint marital account to Branthoover's Pay Pal account 
provided financial resources to support the enterprise's 
activities. 
111. 
Operational Security Measures: The enterprise implemented 
specific measures to protect its operations: 1) Myers acquired a 
secondary phone number during her Oklahoma visit (Paragraph 
38). 
1v. 
Myers returned with pepper spray to support the false domestic 
violence narrative (Paragraph 37). 
v. 
Branthoover attempted to control communications by falsely 
claiming legal representation (Paragraph 40). 
v1. 
Geographic Distribution: The enterprise maintained operations 
across state lines, with activities in both Texas and Oklahoma, 
enhancing its ability to avoid detection and complicate legal 
responses.

C. Enterprise Distinct from Racketeering Activity 
93. As Allstate Ins. Co. v. Donovan, CIVIL ACTION NO. H-12-0432 (S.D. Tex. Jul 
03, 2012) reiterates, a RICO enterprise must be an entity 'separate and apart from the 
alleged pattern of racketeering'-not merely a conduit for the predicate acts themselves. 
The nature and duration of the Myers-Branthoover operation exhibits all three required 
elements: a separate organizational purpose, defined roles within an enduring structure, 
and coordinated decision-making extending beyond the January 16, 2024 initial outcome, 
with the finalization of the scheme still pending.

technically portable, the business depended on commercial-grade internet, low-latency 
upload speeds, and a consistent, uninterrupted digital environment to support real-time 
financial analytics, streaming, and API-based services. Following the removal, Plaintiff 
was unable to find alternate housing with sufficient bandwidth. Attempts to work from 
temporary family residences failed, as Plaintiff's usage either exceeded available internet 
capacity or interfered with household connectivity, making it impossible to maintain 
stable service. Without the ability to stream, deliver data products, or support his clients, 
Plaintiffs revenue quickly declined and client engagement deteriorated.

averaging $2,632.43 per month - his baseline earnings during the period of restructuring. 
Based on past performance, technical stability, and confirmed subscriber growth through 
marketing strategies, Plaintiff reasonably projected returning to $5,000/month by mid-
2024, with stable, scalable performance continuing through 2025.

Defendants' interference, Plaintiff would have earned:

and income-generating business from that location. This action caused a direct and
immediate injury to Plaintiff’s business, cutting off his ability to scale as planned. Instead
of growing, Plaintiff’s revenue collapsed.

Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, which was subsequently routed to Morgan Michelle Myers. 
These funds were used to purchase a second phone for Myers, enabling concealed

the account to be overdrawn, which harmed Plaintiff’s business. Id. ¶ 26. Plaintiff contends 
that this transfer constitutes wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343, and that Defendant 
Myers’ trip to Oklahoma violated the Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1952. Id. ¶¶ 25, 59, 74. On 
December 17, 2023, Defendant Myers allegedly “completed the interstate transportation 
phase of the criminal scheme by transporting the fraudulent court documents prepared in 
Oklahoma back across state lines to Texas. Id. ¶ 35. These documents were filed in a Texas 
court the next day. Id. ¶ 39. On January 16, 2024, Plaintiff was ordered to vacate the home 
he shared with Defendant Myers. Id. ¶ 47. According to Plaintiff, this marked the 
achievement of Defendants’ primary criminal objective. Id. ¶¶ 47-48.

the plaintiff’s favor, the plaintiff still ‘must nudge the claim across the line from 
conceivable or speculative to plausible.’” Id. (quoting Brooks v. Mentor Worldwide LLC, 
985 F.3d 1272, 1281 (10th Cir. 2021)). “Mere ‘labels and conclusions’ or ‘formulaic 
recitation of the elements of a cause of action’ will not suffice.” Id. (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. 
v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). 
DISCUSSION 
“To plead a valid RICO claim, a plaintiff must plausibly allege that a defendant ‘(1) 
conducted the affairs (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.’” 
Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851, 858 (10th Cir. 2022) (quoting George v. Urb. Settlement 
Servs., 833 F.3d 1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016)). 
Because the Court finds that Plaintiff did not adequately allege a pattern of 
racketeering activity, it tailors its analysis to that element. “[A] RICO pattern requires that 
the racketeering predicates relate to each other and amount to a threat of continued 
racketeering activity.” Id. (citing H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239 (1989)).  
“[R]acketeering predicates relate to each other if they ‘have the same or similar 
purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are 
interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.’” Id. at 859 
(quoting H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 240). “Predicate acts satisfy the relationship requirement 
when they make up one common scheme.” Id. (citing Sil-Flo, Inc. v. SFHC, Inc., 917 F.2d 
1507, 1516 (10th Cir. 1990)). The standard is “‘not a cumbersome one.’” Id. (quoting Bixler

DISCUSSION

“To plead a valid RICO claim, a plaintiff must plausibly allege that a defendant ‘(1)
conducted the affairs (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.’”
Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851, 858 (10th Cir. 2022) (quoting George v. Urb. Settlement
Servs., 833 F.3d 1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016)).

Because the Court finds that Plaintiff did not adequately allege a pattern of
racketeering activity, it tailors its analysis to that element. “[A] RICO pattern requires that
the racketeering predicates relate to each other and amount to a threat of continued
racketeering activity.” Jd. (citing H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239 (1989)).

“TR]acketeering predicates relate to each other if they ‘have the same or similar

The continuity requirement on the other hand is “more stringent than the 
relationship standard.” Id. (citing Bixler, 596 F.3d at 761). Continuity “‘depends on the 
facts of each case[],’” id. (quoting H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241-42), and “can be either closed 
or open ended[,]” id. (citing H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241). “Closed-ended continuity is a 
closed period of repeated racketeering conduct, while open-ended continuity consists of 
racketeering conduct that threatens future repetition.” Id. (citing H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241).  
“Plaintiffs can establish open-ended continuity by showing that the racketeering acts 
involved implicit or explicit threats of repetition, that they formed the operations of an 
association that exists for criminal purposes, or that they were the defendants’ regular way 
of conducting a legitimate enterprise.” Id. at 859-60 (citing H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 242-43).  
“[C]losed-ended continuity consists of a closed period of repeated, related 
racketeering acts that do not necessarily threaten future repetition.” Id. at 860 (citing H.J. 
Inc., 492 U.S. at 241-42). And “[b]ecause RICO targets long-term racketeering conduct, 
closed-ended continuity requires a series of related racketeering acts over a ‘substantial 
period of time.’” Id. (quoting H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 242). Two factors are relevant to 
determine whether there is closed-ended continuity: “the duration of the related predicate 
acts and the extensiveness of the racketeering scheme. Id. (citation omitted). Regarding the 
first factor, “predicate acts extending over a few weeks or months do not show closed-
ended continuity.” Poindexter v. Stuteville, No. CIV-12-0031-F, 2012 WL 13035041, at *7

The continuity requirement on the other hand is “more stringent than the
relationship standard.” /d. (citing Bixler, 596 F.3d at 761). Continuity “‘depends on the
facts of each case[],’” id. (quoting H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241-42), and “can be either closed
or open ended[,]” id. (citing H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241). “Closed-ended continuity is a
closed period of repeated racketeering conduct, while open-ended continuity consists of
racketeering conduct that threatens future repetition.” /d. (citing H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241).

“Plaintiffs can establish open-ended continuity by showing that the racketeering acts
involved implicit or explicit threats of repetition, that they formed the operations of an
association that exists for criminal purposes, or that they were the defendants’ regular way
of conducting a legitimate enterprise.” Jd. at 859-60 (citing HJ. Inc., 492 U.S. at 242-43).

“TC]losed-ended continuity consists of a closed period of repeated, related
racketeering acts that do not necessarily threaten future repetition.” /d. at 860 (citing HJ.
Inc., 492 U.S. at 241-42). And “[b]ecause RICO targets long-term racketeering conduct,
closed-ended continuity requires a series of related racketeering acts over a ‘substantial
period of time.’” /d. (quoting H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 242). Two factors are relevant to
determine whether there is closed-ended continuity: “the duration of the related predicate
acts and the extensiveness of the racketeering scheme. /d. (citation omitted). Regarding the
first factor, “predicate acts extending over a few weeks or months do not show closed-
ended continuity.” Poindexter v. Stuteville, No. CIV-12-0031-F, 2012 WL 13035041, at *7
(W.D. Okla. May 10, 2012) (citing Resol. Tr. Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir.
1993)), abrogated on other grounds by Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938 (2009)). For

the second factor, courts “consider ‘the number of victims, the number of racketeering acts,

the variety of racketeering acts, whether the injuries were distinct, the complexity and size 
of the scheme, and the nature or character of the enterprise.’” Johnson, 56 F.4th at 860 
(quoting Resol. Tr. Corp., 998 F.2d at 1543). 
Plaintiff alleges that Defendants’ “scheme extends over a substantial period of 
time—from December 2023 through May 2025, over eighteen months[,]” Doc. No. 16,       
¶ 86(i). The predicate acts—wire fraud and violation of the Travel Act—took place within 
days of each other in December of 2023. Id. ¶¶ 83-84. Plaintiff claims that Defendants’ 
alleged scheme “achieved its primary criminal objective” on January 16, 2024, when he 
was ordered to vacate the family home. Id. ¶ 47. So it took just over one month from the 
formation of the alleged enterprise to complete its primary goal. Nevertheless, Plaintiff 
points to the following to demonstrate the duration of the scheme: 
• Defendants’ continued interstate communication regarding the case “in 
direct furtherance of their fraudulent scheme to see the divorce through to 
its finalization[;]” 
 
• Defendant Branthoover’s June 23, 2024, text message to Plaintiff stating 
“Lol. And here comes another denial[;]” 
 
• Defendant Branthoover’s December 12, 2024, text message to Plaintiff 
stating "When things all over you get to deal with me. Just a heads up[;]” 
 
• Defendant Branthoover’s statement “I’ve been enjoying watching every 
filing get denied[;]” and 
 
• Defendant Branthoover’s May 24, 2025, text message to Plaintiff stating 
“Where’s my lawsuit? Heard your vm about me. File it. Let’s do this :)[.]” 
 
Id. ¶¶ 49-52. But the communications between Defendants and the text messages from 
Defendant Branthoover are not related to the initial scheme, nor do they show continuity 
sufficient to demonstrate a pattern of racketeering activities.

Beginning with the relatedness prong, Plaintiff does not allege that the text messages 
from Defendant Branthoover were sent with the intention of defrauding Plaintiff of money, 
or to create and file fraudulent court documents. See Doc. No. 16, ¶ 101 (claiming that the 
purpose of the predicate acts was “to defraud Plaintiff of his property interests and 
manipulate judicial proceedings”). Instead, he alleges that these texts evidence retaliation, 
malice, and involvement in the Texas litigation. Id. ¶¶ 49-52. Aside from being temporally 
distinct, the messages are distinct in character from the initial alleged scheme and do not 
evidence criminal conduct. And as for the alleged interstate communications between 
Defendants regarding the case, this allegation is conclusory and does not demonstrate that 
the communications relate to the initial common scheme to defraud Plaintiff and to file 
false documents created across state lines. Id. ¶ 101. Accordingly, Plaintiff has failed to 
meet the bar of relatedness sufficient to show a pattern of racketeering activity.3 
 
The same is true for the continuity prong of the pattern requirement. Plaintiff points 
to the text messages from Defendant Branthoover and the continuing communication 
between Defendants as evidence of an implicit or explicit threat of repetition. But these 
messages—while taunting—do not plausibly support a continuing threat of criminal 
conduct. Neither do the vaguely pled claims of continued communications between 
Defendants. So Plaintiff fails to demonstrate open-ended continuity.  
 
3 Plaintiff alleges that perjury and subornation of perjury sufficiently connect the predicate 
acts of wire fraud and violation of the Travel Act. Doc. No. 16, ¶¶ 87-88. Assuming without 
deciding that is true, he still does not relate the text messages and on-going communication 
to the predicate acts that were performed in December of 2023 and successfully completed 
in January of 2024.

Regarding closed-ended continuity, “it is well established that a single scheme to 
accomplish one discrete goal, directed at a finite group of individuals, with no potential to 
extend to other persons or entities, rarely will suffice to establish a threat of continuing 
racketeering activity.” Pagel v. Wash. Mut. Bank, Inc., 153 F. App’x 498, 502 (10th Cir. 
2005) (collecting cases). Plaintiff alleges a scheme that achieved its primary objective 
within one month of its formation, harmed only one victim, had no potential to harm others, 
involved two predicate acts of an isolated nature, and consisted of two individuals. And 
even if the scheme lasted over 18 months, when considering the factors set out in 
Resolution Trust, Plaintiff alleges “at best…a closed-ended series of predicate acts 
constituting a single scheme to accomplish a discrete goal directed at only one individual 
with no potential to extend to other persons or entities.” Poindexter, 2012 WL 13035041, 
at *7 (citing Hall v. Witteman, 584 F.3d 859, 867-68 (10th Cir. 2009)). This is insufficient 
to establish closed-ended continuity. 
 
 “Courts have uniformly and consistently held that schemes involving a single, 
narrow purpose and one or few participants directed towards a single victim do not satisfy 
the RICO requirement of a closed or open pattern of continuity.”  Skurkey v. Daniel, No. 
CIV-22-496-R, 2023 WL 101946, at *6 (W.D. Okla. Jan. 4, 2023) (citation and quotation 
marks omitted). Because that is the exact scheme Plaintiff alleges, he has failed to plead a 
viable civil RICO claim regarding Defendants’ purported scheme.4 
 
4 Plaintiff’s claims for conspiracy under § 1962(d) likewise fails. See Skurkey, 2023 WL 
101946, at *6 (“Because Plaintiff has no viable claim under § 1962(c), the subsection (d) 
conspiracy claim fails as a matter of law.”).
