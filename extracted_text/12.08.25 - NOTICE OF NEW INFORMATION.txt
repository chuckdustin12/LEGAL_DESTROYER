To the Honorable Justices of the Supreme Court, 
I am writing to submit new and critical information pertinent to my petition 
for review in the above-referenced case. On June 2nd, 2024 at 3:51 P.M., I received 
a phone call from Margie Wilson, the grandmother of my wife and the landlord 
of our residence at 6641 Anne Court. Mrs. Wilson provided the following 
critical information: 
1. Mrs. Wilson confirmed that my wife, Morgan Michelle Myers, has 
not been paying the rent for our residence for the past few months, 
despite being required to do so by the temporary court orders.
2. Mrs. Wilson expressed concerns about the health and wellbeing of my 
children, specifically Mara, as Morgan has not obtained the required 
insurance for them and has not taken them to see a doctor.
3. Mrs. Wilson mentioned that Morgan has been acting “not like herself”, 
raising concerns about her ability to provide proper care for our 
children.
Additionally, I must inform the court that I will be without a residence 
starting July 1st, 2024. I have been staying temporarily at my grandmother’s house, 
but she has sold the home, and they will close on July 1st, which is when I will be 
required to leave. My inability to provide for my children without a stable home

To the Honorable Justices of the Supreme Court,

I am writing to submit new and critical information pertinent to my petition
for review in the above-referenced case. On June 2™, 2024 at 3:51 P.M., I received
a phone call from Margie Wilson, the grandmother of my wife and the landlord
of our residence at 6641 Anne Court. Mrs. Wilson provided the following

critical information:

1. Mrs. Wilson confirmed that my wife, Morgan Michelle Myers, has
not been paying the rent for our residence for the past few months,
despite being required to do so by the temporary court orders.

2. Mrs. Wilson expressed concerns about the health and wellbeing of my
children, specifically Mara, as Morgan has not obtained the required

further exacerbates the situation, making it critical for the court to reconsider the 
current orders. 
I am unable to obtain a formal affidavit from Mrs. Wilson due to her 
request for confidentiality. However, I believe it is imperative that the court is 
made aware of these developments as they are directly relevant to the issues 
under review, particularly the enforcement and fairness of the family court 
orders. 
I respectfully request that this new information be considered in the 
review of my case. If needed, I am willing to testify under oath regarding this 
conversation and provide any further information the court may require. 
This situation is exactly what I had feared as outlined within the pleadings 
on record. 
Despite our differences, the grandparents and I have always maintained an 
amicable relationship, and the call received displays our joint concern over the 
Children in this case. 
Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.
