TO THE HONORABLE DAVID L. EVANS OF THE 87 ADMINISTRATIVE

REGION OF TEXAS:

The undersigned, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, hereby OBJECTS to the handling of

these recusal matters, and in support thereof, shows the following:

I. THE CORRECT RECUSAL PROCEDURE

The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure are clear. Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a lays out the proper

procedure that shall be followed when a motion to recuse is filed. Jd. (e) sets forth the Duties of

the Clerk, which amount to delivering the motion or response /d. (e)(1), and the delivery of the

order of recusal or referral. Id. (e)(2).

II. ISSUE 
 
There are two significant procedural errors that must be immediately addressed. 
First, Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure does not authorize or delegate any 
responsibility for handling recusal matters to the court coordinator. Despite an explicit and timely 
objection to the coordinator's involvement outlined within the pending recusal motion itself, the 
coordinator continues to improperly manage and influence the referral process. This 
unauthorized participation represents a fundamental procedural violation that undermines the 
neutrality and integrity of the recusal proceedings. 
Second, the involvement of Hon. Jeffrey Kaitcer in the current referral is entirely 
improper and unnecessary, as the current motion for recusal specifically and explicitly names 
only Hon. James Munford as the respondent judge. While the current motion does reference a 
prior joint recusal motion historically—where Hon. Kaitcer was previously named—that 
reference is strictly contextual and does not constitute a renewed or active request for his recusal 
at this juncture. The plain language and explicit identification in the current motion leave no 
reasonable ambiguity that the recusal sought at present involves only Judge Munford. Therefore, 
Judge Kaitcer’s unilateral decision to decline recusal and issue a referral, despite no pending 
recusal against him, is procedurally incorrect and strongly suggests the motion itself was not 
reviewed substantively before action was taken. 
These procedural missteps—the continued improper involvement of the court coordinator 
and the erroneous implication of a second judge—constitute clear violations of Rule 18a, 
compromise the impartiality required by judicial ethics, and further evidence that due diligence 
was not exercised in considering the motion as filed.

III. APPLICATION OF LAW 
 
A trial court has no discretion in determining what the law is or applying the law to the 
facts even when the law is unsettled. In re Prudential, 148 S.W.3d at 135. Consequently, a clear 
failure by the trial court to analyze or apply the law correctly will constitute an abuse of 
discretion. Walker v Packer, 827 S.W.2d at 840 (Tex.1992). Here, the continuous disregard for 
the undersigned’s pleadings, the Texas Constitution, the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and the 
Texas Family Code has resulted in cumulative and severe harm: a minor child has sustained 
preventable injury due solely to judicial inaction; the Petitioner continues to evade adjudication 
despite credible, unrefuted, and well-documented allegations of fraud; and opposing counsel—
who has never substantively responded to any pleading nor demonstrated her authority to act 
pursuant to Rule 12—continues to receive judicial favor, undermining fundamental due process 
protections. This persistent tolerance for procedural irregularities denies the undersigned equal 
protection under law and creates a significant risk of ongoing and future delays, as every action 
undertaken by this unauthorized attorney remains vulnerable to being stricken or invalidated. 
Consequently, the judicial process has become one that incentivizes silence, penalizes diligence, 
and leaves vulnerable children exposed to avoidable and foreseeable harm. Moreover, this 
conduct demonstrates an unacceptable level of bias: a judge who was never implicated in the 
present recusal motion has inexplicably involved himself without justification, the court 
coordinator improperly continues to perform roles for which she has no lawful authority, and 
Texas law is repeatedly misapplied, consistently to the detriment of the undersigned and his 
children. This troubling pattern of behavior erodes public trust, compromises judicial integrity, 
and necessitates immediate corrective action.

IV. CONCLUSION 
The issues necessitating this recusal are precisely the errors and procedural misconduct 
outlined herein. The Court has repeatedly issued perfunctory orders lacking any substantive legal 
explanation, mirroring the persistent silence and inaction of the opposing counsel. No valid legal 
justification has been offered to explain the sustained disregard for the Texas Rules of Civil 
Procedure, the Texas Family Code, and fundamental principles of due process. The undersigned 
respectfully reiterates that this is a Family Law proceeding—one that profoundly impacts 
children and families—not a venue for procedural indifference or selective enforcement. At a 
minimum, the Court must adhere strictly and impartially to the established rules and procedural 
requirements. Unless and until there is clear evidence that the pending Motion to Recuse has 
been properly and substantively reviewed and considered, the undersigned expressly objects to 
any scheduling of further hearings or proceedings in this matter. This objection is filed not out of 
disrespect, but rather out of necessity and urgency, to document and bring attention to continued 
procedural irregularities and judicial oversights that have compromised the fairness and integrity 
of this case. The undersigned seeks only the due process and equal protection to which all 
litigants are entitled, and which the record thus far has conspicuously failed to reflect.
