TO THE HONORABLE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS: 
There has been put forth an enormous effort by the Relator to correct the 
situation at hand. This effort has not been to harass the judiciary or the parties in 
this case, but rather to uphold the keystone of Family Law that has been missing 
from this case: decisions that are in the best interests of the children. 
As the Texas Family Code mandates, “The best interest of the child shall 
always be the primary consideration of the court in determining the issues of 
conservatorship and possession of and access to the child.” Tex. Fam. Code 
153.002. Furthermore, this State’s policy is to “assure that children will have 
frequent and continuing contact with parents who have shown the ability to act in 
the best interest of the child;” Id. 153.001.  
Here, these two statutory mandates are not being met. The children in this 
matter have continuous and frequent contact with neither parent, one of whom has 
been continuously prevented from accessing his residence, and the other who has 
shown that she cannot act in their best interests by attempting to erase the Relator 
from their lives.  
This isn’t just an emergency situation – it’s a manifest injustice that has 
continued to compound as time progresses. No guidance has been provided outside 
of per curiam denials, and the nature of the damage cannot be undone later, and 
cannot be remedied by way of an appeal. Relator asks for an immediate stay.

TO THE HONORABLE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS:

There has been put forth an enormous effort by the Relator to correct the
situation at hand. This effort has not been to harass the judiciary or the parties in
this case, but rather to uphold the keystone of Family Law that has been missing

from this case: decisions that are in the best interests of the children.

As the Texas Family Code mandates, “The best interest of the child shall
always be the primary consideration of the court in determining the issues of
conservatorship and possession of and access to the child.” Tex. Fam. Code
153.002. Furthermore, this State’s policy is to “assure that children will have
frequent and continuing contact with parents who have shown the ability to act in

the best interest of the child;” /d. 153.001.

Here, these two statutory mandates are not being met. The children in this
matter have continuous and frequent contact with neither parent, one of whom has
been continuously prevented from accessing his residence, and the other who has
shown that she cannot act in their best interests by attempting to erase the Relator

from their lives.

This isn’t just an emergency situation — it’s a manifest injustice that has
continued to compound as time progresses. No guidance has been provided outside
of per curiam denials, and the nature of the damage cannot be undone later, and

cannot be remedied by way of an appeal. Relator asks for an immediate stay.

I. 
NATURE OF THE EMERGENCY 
The Relator has filed three emergency stay motions, one in cause number 
25-0361, one in 25-0426, and one in the instant matter, 25-0458. The effects of not 
granting a stay are already before this court. Had 25-0361 issued, cases 25-0426 
and 25-0458 would not have been filed because the court would have been 
prevented from trying to proceed below during the midst of the raised issues. Each 
day that these issues are left unresolved causes more harm that can’t be repaired 
later.   
The Relator continues to be kept away from his residence, the Real Party 
continues to remain silent on the issues, and there has been no provided guidance 
on how to correct this situation. The Relator has been kept away from his home for 
over fourteen months now and has received no explanation as to how an agreed 
order missing his signature and which doesn’t even have the correct residential 
address on it can withstand judicial scrutiny and be permitted to wreak havoc on 
the lives of the children in this case, and the Relator himself. 
The emergency situation began on March 14, 2024, and everything in-
between amounts to the Relator’s efforts to regain his rights in the face of absolute 
silence while the issues continue to compound. A stay will preserve these rights 
pending determination, prevent further errors, and uphold this State’s policy.

II. 
PRESERVATION OF RIGHTS 
In addition to 52.10 of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure, a broader 
ground for emergency stay motions is found in Texas Rule of Appellate 
Procedure 29.3, which authorizes appellate courts to "make any temporary 
orders necessary to preserve the parties' rights until disposition of the appeal." 
As referenced in In re Tex. Educ. Agency, 619 S.W.3d 679 (Tex. 2021), this rule 
provides a flexible basis for seeking temporary relief during the appellate 
process. 
The key consideration under Rule 29.3 is whether the requested stay is 
"necessary to preserve the parties' rights" during the appeal. This language gives 
the court significant discretion to grant stays when it determines that failing to 
do so would impair the rights of one or more parties before the appeal can be 
resolved. 
The “emergency” designation indicates that the motion requires expedited 
consideration due to time-sensitive circumstances. Emergencies typically 
involve situations where: 
1. Immediate action is needed to prevent irreparable harm 
2. The trial court is proceeding despite a statutory stay 
3. Execution on a judgment is imminent

4. A child's safety or welfare is at immediate risk 
5. The effectiveness of the court’s ultimate judgment would be 
compromised without immediate relief 
All five of these elements are met here: 
1. Immediate action is needed to prevent the undue separation of the 
Relator from his children, the ongoing damage to the parent-child 
bond, and the financial damages that continue to accrue with each 
passing day. 
2. The trial court is proceeding below without awaiting guidance from 
this Court, taking further steps that risk compounding error and 
infringing on rights that are the subject of pending review. 
3. Execution on a judgment is imminent: namely, the anticipated 
reinstatement of Hon. Munford and Hon. Kaitcer in the recusal 
proceedings below, which will almost certainly be issued despite two 
active mandamuses pending before this Court related to those very 
proceedings. That reinstatement will force the Relator to file yet 
another mandamus, as no adequate appellate remedy would remain. 
4. The children’s welfare has been at substantial risk for far too long. 
They have lost the connection with a loving, fit parent without legal

basis, and are now subjected to a psychologically harmful 
environment in which their Father has been replaced. No efforts are 
being made to maintain or restore any form of a relationship with him, 
even as these issues remain unresolved before this Court. 
5. The effectiveness of this Court’s ultimate judgment would be
compromised without immediate relief. If the trial court proceeds and
issues additional rulings under a structurally flawed framework, this
Court’s eventual decision—no matter how correct—may arrive too
late to undo the compounded harm or fully restore the status quo.
In addition, there has been no response or opposition to these motions. The 
Relator has duly notified each party of his intention, and no response has been 
provided either here or in the form of correspondence by the Respondent judges or 
the opposing counsel. In essence, the case has been stayed for several months 
because there has been no action taken outside of the Relator seeking relief which 
has lead to the five mandamus petitions before this court filed by him. 
Staying the proceedings now would provide the much needed relief for the 
children and the Relator that cannot wait another day. Absent a response or 
opposition, and given the issues raised across all five of his petitions, the Relator 
reiterates that by not granting an immediate stay, irreversible damage will continue.

CONCLUSION AND PRAYER FOR RELIEF 
For the reasons detailed above, and those incorporated in the emergency stay 
filed in case numbers 25-0361 and 25-0426, as well as the third amended motion to 
consolidate filed in all cases, and the affidavit in support of the stay filed in the 
lowest numbered cause, the Relator, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, respectfully 
requests that this Honorable Court act swiftly to restore justice to these 
proceedings. Specifically, the Relator requests that the Court: 
1. IMMEDIATELY GRANT this emergency motion to stay to prevent further 
irreparable harm and ensure the protection of the Relator's rights and the 
welfare of his children. 
2. ISSUE the grant today, if possible, to serve the interests of justice and 
provide immediate relief from the ongoing harm and procedural 
irregularities.

have the opportunity to address the issues raised in this motion in a timely 
manner. 
The Relator emphasizes the critical nature of this request and the need for prompt 
judicial intervention to prevent further injustice and protect the welfare of all 
parties involved.
