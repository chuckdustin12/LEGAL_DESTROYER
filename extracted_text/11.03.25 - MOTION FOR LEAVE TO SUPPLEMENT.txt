TO THE HONORABLE SECOND COURT OF APPEALS: 
Relator, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, files this Motion for Leave to 
Supplement the Record and respectfully shows this Court the following: 
I. BACKGROUND
1.
On October 31, 2025, this Honorable Court denied Relator's petition for writ
of mandamus without addressing the merits. 
2.
Contemporaneously with this motion, Relator has filed a Motion for
Rehearing based on the jurisdictional defect evident from the case docket, 
which clearly demonstrates that the Associate Judge exceeded his authority by 
acting without the statutorily required written order of referral. 
3.
Through inadvertence or oversight, the case docket was not included in the
original mandamus record filed with this Court. 
II. REQUEST TO SUPPLEMENT
4.
Relator now respectfully requests leave to supplement the mandamus record
with the official case docket from Cause No. 322-744263-23, which is material 
and necessary to the Court's determination of the jurisdictional issue presented. 
5.
The case docket is properly authenticated by Relator's unsworn declaration
pursuant to Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code § 132.001, as shown in the 
attached Supplemental Appendix.

TO THE HONORABLE SECOND COURT OF APPEALS:

Relator, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, files this Motion for Leave to

Supplement the Record and respectfully shows this Court the following:

I. BACKGROUND

1. On October 31, 2025, this Honorable Court denied Relator's petition for writ
of mandamus without addressing the merits.

2. Contemporaneously with this motion, Relator has filed a Motion for
Rehearing based on the jurisdictional defect evident from the case docket,
which clearly demonstrates that the Associate Judge exceeded his authority by
acting without the statutorily required written order of referral.

3. Through inadvertence or oversight, the case docket was not included in the

original mandamus record filed with this Court.

II. REQUEST TO SUPPLEMENT
4. Relator now respectfully requests leave to supplement the mandamus record
with the official case docket from Cause No. 322-744263-23, which is material

6.
The docket entries conclusively demonstrate that the Associate Judge began
presiding over hearings and issuing substantive orders months before any order 
of referral appears in the record. 
III. APPLICABLE LAW
7.
Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 52.7(b) permits supplementation of the
record with additional materials when necessary to a full understanding of the 
issues presented in the petition. 
8.
This Court has discretion to allow supplementation of the mandamus record,
especially when the additional materials are critical to resolving a jurisdictional 
defect. 
9.
The attached docket, attached as Exhibit 1, is relevant and material to the
consideration of Relator's petition because it conclusively demonstrates the lack 
of a written order of referral required by Texas Family Code § 201.006 and 
Texas Government Code § 54A.007. 
IV. PRAYER
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Relator Charles Dustin Myers 
respectfully requests that this Court grant this Motion for Leave to Supplement the 
Record, accept the attached case docket as a supplement to the mandamus record, 
and grant such other and further relief to which Relator may be justly entitled.
