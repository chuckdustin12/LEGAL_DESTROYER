Prior to the State’s intervention on January 16, 2024, (R. 158) I was 
an active, involved, and loving father that cared for both of my daughters 
each day. I helped them get ready in the mornings, walked them to school, 
visited them for lunch time, and picked them up. While they were at school, 
I worked from home where I would provide real-time market data services 
to clients across the United States and Canada. I was responsible for all the 
household finances, including rent, both car payments, and ensuring our 
children and my spouse remained financially stable and safe, and used the 
daytime to ensure these obligations were met. When the children return 
home from school, I would assist them with any homework, play with them 
outside, and prepare meals for them. 
Morgan Michelle Myers benefitted from these efforts and worked part 
time at the Watauga Recreation Center during the evenings (R. 65 at 5), 
where I would watch over the children, help them with their after-school 
activities, including homework and extra-curriculars such as dance class, and 
would get them ready for bed each night and read them a story. In essence, I 
was involved in every aspect of their life from the time they woke up in the 
morning until they went to sleep in the evenings.

morning until they went to sleep in the evenings.

Around October of 2022, Morgan began communicating extensively

with an individual named Damen Kazlauskas, which exponentially grew into

an extramarital affair which peaked right around the sudden Divorce 
announcement made by Morgan on December 1, 2023. The levels of 
communication between these individuals exceeded all other contacts other 
than Debbie Price, a friend of hers, who helped facilitate this extramarital 
affair. (R. 231). The discovery of these interactions led to the subsequent 
pleadings that followed, which were prepared in part by third parties not 
named in the suit (R. 1686).  
 
In totality, Morgan intentionally lied to the trial court below when she 
stated the following: 
1. That she was financially indigent. (R. 60-72) Morgan had access to 
the joint marital bank account, which she depleted with the 
assistance of a third party, who admitted this. (R. 1685) Morgan 
herself even admitted that this occurred. (R. 1691-1692) The bank 
statement also shows this transaction occurred. (R. 1682) 
2. That we stopped living together as couples on December 1, 2023. I 
remained in our family home caring for our daughters up until my 
removal on January 16, 2024 and continued to pay for bills and 
household expenses. (R. 1711)

recognize multiple internal contradictions that warrant concern. On 
one hand, she requested joint managing conservatorship (R. 51 
at a-2), while simultaneously asserting that she had filed for an 
emergency protective order on December 14, 2023 (R. 54 at 
9B). In that same filing, she claimed that a protective order was 
already in effect and that it included a judicial finding of family 
violence committed by me during the marriage (R. 54 at 10)—a 
serious allegation that has never been substantiated by evidence, 
hearing, or court order. 
4. In that same initial pleading, Morgan declared both family vehicles 
as her separate property (R. 55 at 11B). 
5. She further alleged that she would be abused or harassed if I were 
granted access to her contact information, a claim that directly 
contradicts her stated request for joint managing 
conservatorship, which necessarily requires regular and 
cooperative communication between both parents for decision-
making related to the children. (R. 57 at 15) 
6. Compounding the confusion, Morgan proceeded to file a second

protection on December 14 and that an order was already in place. 
This second application (R. 79–80) reiterated many of the same 
allegations, which remain unproven and unsupported by any 
judicial finding to this day. 
7. On December 22, 2023, Morgan filed a second application for a 
protective order in which she alleged that an incident of family 
violence occurred on December 18, 2023. However, on December 
19, 2023—one day after the alleged event—she sent me a text 
message stating, “The only thing filed is a petition for divorce. It's 
not an actual agreement. All the details that we need to sit down 
and agree on will officially happen in 61 days.” (R. 1692) 
These deceptive actions are apparent from the face of the record, have 
been alleged without any rebuttal or denial of these claims, and lead to the 
removal of my home, business, and children’s lives on January 16, 2024. 
These were not minor errors. These false allegations were so significant, and 
have had life-altering effects on myself and my children, whose relationship 
has been affected by these initial decisions substantially. What’s worse is 
that after her advantage was secured, she began to cut me out of our 
children’s lives, replacing me with the same individual she was texting in the 
beginning of this ordeal, Damen Kazlauskas. Her deception is extraordinary.

CONCLUSION 
 
In sum, I have maintained respect for the tribunal below and for all 
parties involved. But what has occurred in this case is egregious, damaging, 
and unredressed. For over fourteen months, I have sought clarity as to how 
a situation this self-evidently flawed could persist without correction—
unopposed, undisputed, and unadjudicated. A failure of this magnitude 
should never occur, especially when the record shows silence from the party 
that obtained everything and accountability from the one left with nothing. 
Based on the totality of the record and my direct experience, I solemnly 
affirm the following to be true and/or believe them to be true under penalty 
of perjury: 
1. I believe I was denied a meaningful forum to assert my rights from 
the outset. From day one, I was placed at a significant disadvantage, 
stripped of my home, children, and livelihood, and every proceeding 
thereafter was procedurally imbalanced. 
2. I believe Morgan’s pleadings were so materially deceptive and 
fundamentally fraudulent that they created a prejudicial narrative that 
foreclosed any fair opportunity for me to respond or defend myself.

CONCLUSION

In sum, I have maintained respect for the tribunal below and for all

a situation this self-evidently flawed could persist without correction—
unopposed, undisputed, and unadjudicated. A failure of this magnitude
should never occur, especially when the record shows silence from the party
that obtained everything and accountability from the one left with nothing.
Based on the totality of the record and my direct experience, I solemnly
affirm the following to be true and/or believe them to be true under penalty
of perjury:

1. I believe I was denied a meaningful forum to assert my rights from

the outset. From day one, I was placed at a significant disadvantage,

stripped of my home, children, and livelihood, and every proceeding

thereafter was procedurally imbalanced.

2.1 believe Morgan’s pleadings were so materially deceptive and

fundamentally fraudulent that they created a prejudicial narrative that

foreclosed any fair opportunity for me to respond or defend myself.

3. I believe that my decision to terminate prior counsel and proceed 
pro se, while necessary, deepened the imbalance created by the initial 
misrepresentations. 
4. I believe Morgan’s current counsel lacks lawful authority to 
prosecute this case. There has been no substantive litigation effort or 
evidentiary advancement, and the silence is conspicuous. It is also 
highly suspect that a party who declared financial indigency could 
immediately retain counsel upon being compelled to substantiate her 
claims. 
5. I know that I have never been granted a fair or complete opportunity 
to present evidence refuting Morgan’s claims or to fully defend myself 
on the record. 
6. I know that Morgan has not supported any meaningful co-parenting 
relationship. I routinely go weeks without contact with my children—
including on major holidays and birthdays—despite our previously 
close and daily bond. 
7. I know that Morgan routinely leaves the children in the care of 
relatives during the day, depriving them of both parental presences 
they once had under one roof.

8. I know that Morgan intentionally concealed her extramarital 
affair—discovered on December 12, 2023—and has since pursued it 
to the point of being engaged to Damen Kazlauskas, a man now 
introduced into our children’s lives in my absence. 
9. I know that the settlement agreement executed early in this case was 
drafted while I was under extreme procedural duress and misled 
circumstances, and that my own counsel’s actions in preparing it led 
to his termination and my formal challenge of the agreement. 
10. I know that if no temporary relief or stay is granted by May 16, 
2025, I will become homeless, without a place to live, work, and with 
no access to my children, which I believe is precisely the outcome 
Morgan has orchestrated. 
11. I know that had this matter been heard in a neutral and properly 
balanced tribunal from the beginning, Morgan would not have 
received sole custody or exclusive possession of the residence. A fact-
driven court would have concluded the obvious: I am a fit, loving 
father, and the last year and a half has been spent trying—against all 
odds—to protect my children’s future from a parent whose conduct 
has caused lasting harm.

to the family residence, conduct myself with calm and civility, reunite 
with my children, and begin restoring what was unjustly taken from 
them—a stable home with both parents involved in their lives. 
13. Finally, I know that mistakes happen. We are all human. And 
despite the pain and injustice I have endured, I remain deeply grateful 
for this institution of law, and the fact that this remedy exists. Without 
this Court’s jurisdiction, all would have already been lost. But through 
these proceedings, I place my trust in a system that—when it works—
has the power to correct what lower tribunals failed to.  
It is not vengeance I seek, but restoration. It is not suffering I wish to 
inflict—but only explanation I seek to extract. It is not conflict I bring, but a 
plea for healing—to permit my return home and allow my daughters to have 
their father again, so that we may navigate this divorce as the Family Code 
intended: with dignity, fairness, and without the irreversible sacrifice of a 
loving parent. 
FURTHER AFFIANT SAYETH NOT.
