CHILDREN 
MOTION FOR RECUSAL 
TO THE HONORABLE DAVID EVANS 
OF THE 8TH ADMINISTRATIVE JUDICIAL REGION OF TEXAS: 
In February of 2018, response to a question posed by the Republican Club Political 
Action Committee, the now elected District Judge James Munford stated: 
"I'm running for this office because I've worked many, many years in the family law field. I want 
to help and work with the citizens of Tarrant County and the families of Tarrant County to 
provide a good and accurate judiciary that follows the rules of law." 
However, in this case, Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, has encountered a 
series of judicial determinations that fundamentally contradict this objective. The 
assurance to uphold a judiciary that follows the rule of law has been replaced with 
decisions that have deprived the Respondent of due process, equitable hearings, and his 
fundamental paternal rights. Respondent respectfully moves to recuse District Judge 
James Munford and Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer pursuant to TAC § 155.152 & TEX.

assurance to uphold a judiciary that follows the rule of law has been replaced with

I. BASIS FOR RECUSAL 
A. The impartiality of a judge may be challenged in the trial court by a motion to 
recuse. TEX. R. CIV. P. 18a, 18b. The Respondent respectfully moves to recuse Honorable 
Judge James Munford and Honorable Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer from presiding over 
cause number 322-744263-23 1 for their collective inability to remain impartial in this 
matter by depriving the Respondent of a fair trial on four separate appearances. "Texas 
requires the recusal of a judge in any case where his or her impartiality might reasonably 
be questioned, regardless of any actual bias which may be held in a case." Aguilar v. 
Anderson., 855 S.W.2d 799,815. 
B. This motion has been filed at the earliest practicable opportunity, as the 
Respondent has exhausted all other available legal avenues without receiving any response, 
explanation, or opposition. Respondent has given the trial court every opportunity to 
correct the errors made in this case and has recently discovered pertinent information 
related to the initial proceeding that took place on January 16th, 2024, as outlined below. 
There are no current settings or upcoming hearings, and the case has not yet been scheduled 
for a final trial. The Respondent's motion is verified and asserts grounds for recusal 
pursuant to TEX. CIV. R. P. l 8(b )b 1. These grounds are not predicated solely on the judges' 
, 
prior rulings. Instead, this motion presents detailed, particularized facts based on the 
Respondent's direct knowledge that are admissible as evidence and are self-authenticating

II. QUESTIONING THE IMPARTIALITY OF JAMES MUNFORD 
A. On September 29th, 2024, the Respondent discovered a Facebook post made by 
the Tarrant County District Courts which stated the following: 
"The following Tarrant County District Courts will be closed tomorrow, Tuesday, January 16, 
2024. 
This list is evolving as individual Judges are making informed decisions based on their dockets, 
inclement weather, and the safety and welfare of litigants, Court staff, counsel, and the general 
public." - Tarrant County District Courts on January 15, 2024. 
The Fort Worth Independent School District also announced that they would remain 
closed due to inclement weather in the area. https:/lwww.fox4news.com/newsldallas-fort-
worth-school-closings-ian-16. On December 14th, 2024, the petitioner requested a 
protective order from James Munford, which was denied. Exhibit A. However, one month 
and two days later, Judge James Munford made an initial decision that has been 
unexplained for the last ten months. 
B. The initial decision at issue arose during a show cause hearing concerning an 
order of protection initiated by the petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, on December 22, 
2023. This hearing was originally scheduled to be presided over by Associate Judge 
Jeffrey Kaitcer in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County at 9:00 A.M. on January 16th,

proceedings were instead conducted by District Judge James Munford, as Associate 
Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer arrived late. 
C. Both parties were present and appeared without legal representation. During the 
proceedings, Judge Munford presented the parties with an agreed continuance, which 
both parties accepted, and which was subsequently granted by Judge Munford as 
reflected in his order. However, despite granting the continuance, Judge Munford went 
further, issuing a series of rulings where he sua sponte consolidated the protective order 
case with the divorce case previously filed by the petitioner on December 18, 2023. 
Exhibit B. He ordered the Respondent to vacate the residency that same day by 2:00 p.m., 
divested him of the custody of his children, and the hearing was then rescheduled for 
January 22, 2024, to be presided over by Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer. Exhibit C. 
D. This decision by Judge Munford undeniably raises serious questions regarding 
his impartiality in this matter. Due process of law requires that an individual receive 
notice and hearing before being deprived of a property right. In re the Guardianship of 
Bays, 355 S.W.3d 715, 720 (Tex. App. 2011); See Grannis v. Ordean, 234 U.S. 385, 394, 
34 S. Ct. 779, 783, 58 L. Ed. 1363 (1914) ("a fundamental requisite of due process oflaw 
is the opportunity to be heard"). Furthermore, the Texas Family Code prohibits such an 
order before notice and hearing. TEX. FAM. CODE 105.001 (" ... an order may not be

child custody).

E. Moreover, 6.405(b) of the Texas Family Code was not satisfied, which is a 
mandatory requirement before any hearing can take place given the original petition for 
divorce claimed an active order of protection was currently in effect against the 
Respondent. Exhibit B, p. 7. ("The petitioner shall attach to the petition a copy of each 
order described by Subsection (a)( 1) in which a party to the suit or the child of a party to 
the suit was the applicant or victim of the conduct alleged in the application ... if a copy 
of the order is not available at the time of filing, the petition must state that a copy of the 
order will be filed with the court before any hearing.) All of the procedural safeguards 
above were disregarded by James Munford. 
F. The purpose of temporary orders with injunctive relief is not to destroy the 
status quo, but rather to preserve it. See Iranian Muslim Organization v. City of San 
Antonio, 615 S.W.2d 202, 208 (Tex. 1981); Davis v. Huey, 571 S.W.2d 859, 862 (Tex. 
1978); Citizens a/Texas Sav. v. Fox Jacobs, 718 S.W.2d 2, 3 (Tex. App. 1985). Similarly 
to how the temporary injunction in Coyote Lake Ranch, LLC v. City of Lubbock, 498 
S.W.3d 53 (Tex. 2016) improperly denied the City its undisputed right to access 
groundwater-an essential resource-Judge Munford's rulings have deprived the 
Respondent of his residency, which has served not only as the family home since 2015 
but also as the headquarters for his business which provided for the children - an 
essential resource to their wellbeing. Furthermore, the Respondent was divested of 
custodial rights to his children without justification. Like the injunction in Coyote, rather 
than preserving the status quo, these initial rulings have done the opposite by depriving

Respondent. Exhibit B, p. 7. (“The petitioner shall attach to the petition a copy of each
order described by Subsection (a)(1) in which a party to the suit or the child of a party to
the suit was the applicant or victim of the conduct alleged in the application... if a copy
of the order is not available at the time of filing, the petition must state that a copy of the
order will be filed with the court before any hearing.) All of the procedural safeguards

above were disregarded by James Munford.

F. The purpose of temporary orders with injunctive relief is not to destroy the
status quo, but rather to preserve it. See Iranian Muslim Organization v. City of San
Antonio, 615 §.W.2d 202, 208 (Tex. 1981); Davis v. Huey, 571 S.W.2d 859, 862 (Tex.
1978); Citizens of Texas Sav. v. Fox Jacobs, 718 S.W.2d 2, 3 (Tex. App. 1985). Similarly
to how the temporary injunction in Coyote Lake Ranch, LLC vy. City of Lubbock, 498
S.W.3d 53 (Tex. 2016) improperly denied the City its undisputed right to access
groundwater—an essential resource—Judge Munford's rulings have deprived the
Respondent of his residency, which has served not only as the family home since 2015
but also as the headquarters for his business which provided for the children — an
essential resource to their wellbeing. Furthermore, the Respondent was divested of
custodial rights to his children without justification. Like the injunction in Coyote, rather

than preserving the status quo, these initial rulings have done the opposite by depriving

the case relevant to the children's well-being. In the context of this case, recusal is 
warranted if the trial judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned, or he has a 
personal bias. TEX. R. CIV. P. l 8b(2). This opinion or bias was irrel~vant to the well

A. The initial ruling reset the case to January 22nd, 2024. The Respondent retained 
the services of Dan Bacalis, while the Petitioner arrived without any legal representation 
and retained the services of Cooper Carter in the lobby of the courtroom. Much like the 
first setting, Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer granted a continuance which only benefitted 
the petitioner by allowing her legal representation more time to become familiar with the 
case while simultaneously extending the initial orders of Judge James Munford to 
February I 51, 2024, which significantly impacted the Respondent and his children. Exhibit 
D. Neither party appeared before the Jeffrey Kaitcer, and this decision was made without 
any input from the Respondent and without any opportunity to contest it. 
B. At the third trial setting on February I, 2024, the parties arrived only to be 
presented with a settlement agreement from the Respondent's own counsel. Given that

This case, as detailed in the pending motion for rehearing before the Supreme 
Court of Texas, revolves around the core issue of accountability. What began with 
Morgan Michelle Myers attempting to avoid responsibility has now evolved into a 
troubling scenario where both judges have repeatedly failed to recognize and correct their 
serious missteps. Attorney Cooper Carter's authority to represent the petitioner, currently 
being challenged through a Rule 12 motion, further deepens concerns about the integrity 
and fairness of these proceedings. 
Recusing both judges is not just a procedural necessity, but a crucial step toward 
ensuring that this case is reviewed impartially and that the facts are properly considered. 
This will allow the court to focus on the petitioner's pattern of deception and, more 
importantly, what truly serves the best interests of the children. The petitioner's actions 
have caused unnecessary delays, destabilized her family, and inflicted significant 
emotional and financial harm on all involved. The ongoing litigation, exacerbated by a 
lack of judicial transparency and accountability, has only added to the hardship. 
Despite these issues, the Respondent holds no ill will toward any party involved. 
His primary concern has always been, and continues to be, doing what is right for his 
children. The Respondent believes that with impartial judges and a renewed focus on 
fairness, this case can still be resolved justly, allowing all parties to move forward with 
dignity and integrity. The Respondent remains diligent in his commitment to securing a 
fair outcome that reflects the best interests of his children as the Family Code mandates.

VI. CONCLUSION

This case, as detailed in the pending motion for rehearing before the Supreme
Court of Texas, revolves around the core issue of accountability. What began with

Morgan Michelle Myers attempting to avoid responsibility has now evolved into a

troubling scenario where both judges have repeatedly failed to recognize and correct their

serious missteps. Attorney Cooper Carter’s authority to represent the petitioner, currently

being challenged through a Rule 12 motion, further deepens concerns about the integrity

and fairness of these proceedings.

Recusing both judges is not just a procedural necessity, but a crucial step toward
ensuring that this case is reviewed impartially and that the facts are properly considered.
This will allow the court to focus on the petitioner’s pattern of deception and, more
importantly, what truly serves the best interests of the children. The petitioner’s actions
have caused unnecessary delays, destabilized her family, and inflicted significant
emotional and financial harm on all involved. The ongoing litigation, exacerbated by a

lack of judicial transparency and accountability, has only added to the hardship.

Despite these issues, the Respondent holds no ill will toward any party involved.
His primary concern has always been, and continues to be, doing what is right for his
children. The Respondent believes that with impartial judges and a renewed focus on
fairness, this case can still be resolved justly, allowing all parties to move forward with
dignity and integrity. The Respondent remains diligent in his commitment to securing a

1. That the clerk of the court deliver a copy of the motion for recusal to both the 
respondent judges and the regional presiding judge, and deliver any signed orders 
of recusal or referral to the regional presiding judge immediately upon filing. 
2. That the respondent judges either recuse themselves or refer the motion to the 
regional presiding judge within three business days after the motion is filed, and

3. That the regional presiding judge issue interim orders to reset the status quo by 
allowing the Respondent's immediate return to his home and business, thereby

4. That the motion for recusal be conducted by telephone, as permitted by Rule 
18(g)(6)(C), to expedite the process and ensure all documents submitted by
