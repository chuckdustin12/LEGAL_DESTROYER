ISSUES PRESENTED 
1. Given evidence suggesting that the Petitioner fabricated allegations of
family violence to secure a tactical advantage in custody and divorce
proceedings, does this raise a significant legal question regarding the
adequacy of safeguards against misuse of protective orders, potentially
warranting a review of the court’s reliance on unverified claims in making
preliminary decisions affecting parental rights and access to children?
2. Considering the absence of concrete evidence indicating an immediate
risk of harm or abuse towards the Petitioner or minor children, did the
Court’s initial decision to issue Temporary Orders on January 16th, 
followed by January 22nd, and February 1st—thereby excluding the 
Respondent from the family residence and severing his relationship with 
his children—constitute an abuse of discretion lacking clear evidence of 
danger for such emergency action, ultimately leading to a violation of the 
Respondent’s due process and infringement of constitutional and parental 
rights, while also disregarding the children’s best interests? 
3. How can the Court remove one parent from the home without following
the mandated process required by law, resulting in the destruction of the
status quo of the minor children, and further uphold this decision when
no finding of facts has taken place?

EMPLOYMENT HISTORY AND FAMILY DYNAMICS 
1. Throughout their marriage, both parents have alternated roles as stay-at-
home parents, adapting their employment status to meet the 
developmental needs and schedules of their children, now aged seven and 
five. This arrangement has enabled both the Petitioner and Respondent to 
maintain an active and consistent presence in their children’s lives, 
encompassing not only day-to-day care but also engagement in school 
activities and extracurricular events. This hands-on approach has been a 
testament to their dedication to the well-being and upbringing of their

EMPLOYMENT HISTORY AND FAMILY DYNAMICS

1. Throughout their marriage, both parents have alternated roles as stay-at-
home parents, adapting their employment status to meet the
developmental needs and schedules of their children, now aged seven and
five. This arrangement has enabled both the Petitioner and Respondent to
maintain an active and consistent presence in their children’s lives,
encompassing not only day-to-day care but also engagement in school
activities and extracurricular events. This hands-on approach has been a
testament to their dedication to the well-being and upbringing of their
children, demonstrating a flexible yet committed stance towards
balancing family responsibilities with personal and professional

development opportunities as they arise.

8. In November of 2019, the Respondent created a YouTube channel 
entitled Charlie and the Mazdas, where he began to use his self-
certification for internet sales to create personalized videos for internet 
clients during the pandemic, allowing them to see the features of their 
desired vehicle from the comfort of their own home. If the client decided 
to move forward, the Respondent would wrap the steering wheels in 
plastic wrap, wash the vehicles himself, and drive them to the client’s 
residence as a courtesy service during the pandemic.

drawn to the stock market. This interest was sparked by the extraordinary

trading was going to be a lot more challenging than he had first realized,

Charlie and the Mazdas to Charlie’s Vids, where he turned his focus to 
SEC law, covering agency filings out of the Options Clearing Corporation,

To prioritize the children’s well-being and uphold the existing familial structure,

beneficial but essential for their emotional and psychological development. The

THE RESPONDENT’S EFFORTS 
1. Due to having failed legal representation, the resources required to
acquire alternative Counsel after the termination of Mr. Bacalis coupled
with the growing dis-trust of the Judicial System as a whole given the
totality of circumstances left the Respondent with having to represent
himself, which is a task he has taken seriously in an effort to advocate for
his daughters in a zealous manner.
2. The Respondent has researched and is aware of the ever-growing burden
pro-se litigants are becoming on the Courts, their staff, and their
resources due to the vast majority of pro-se litigants not putting in the
time or effort reasonably required to represent themselves effectively or
are solely trying to reduce costs associated with their case, both leading to
increased case lengths and litigation costs.
3. The Respondent in this case stands out from the stereotype as follows:
a. Since the removal of his home on January 16th, 2024, the Respondent

ARGUMENT 
I. Best Interests of the Children
1. In the case concerning the unjust removal of a father from his
residence on January 16, 2024, without prior notice, which abruptly 
ended his meaningful relationship with his daughters and significantly 
impacted his livelihood due to his home-based business operations, the 
Court notably failed to comply with the essential legal principles set forth 
in Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367 (Tex. 1976). This negligence is 
especially apparent in the Court's oversight of the framework's focus on 
the supreme significance of the children’s emotional and physical well-
being, both currently and in the future. 
2. The decision in Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367 (Tex. 1976),
emphasizes the importance of conducting a comprehensive analysis that 
considers an extensive range of considerations—including the children's 
emotional and physical needs, potential risks to their safety, and the 
caregiving capabilities of the parties seeking custody—to determine the 
child's best interest. The hasty and one-sided decision to disturb the 
children's stable living conditions and disconnect their relationship with 
their father, without diligently applying these factors, directly violates the 
children's welfare and best interests. 
4. It is essential to highlight that the Court’s neglect in evaluating the
profound implications on the children’s emotional well-being, by placing 
them in a setting where their relational ties with their father are not only 
unencouraged but actively hindered, flagrantly contravenes established

legal standards and guidance provided by the American Bar Association, 
which prioritizes the physical and emotional needs of the child in custody 
determinations. 
5. Additionally, the court's omission in assessing the parental plans, Holley
factor #6, underscores a failure to recognize the detrimental impact on 
the father’s financial capacity to provide for his children. A thorough 
examination of each parent's plan would unequivocally reveal that the 
mother’s intent is to reduce the father to a child support payment, 
undermining his ability to adequately fulfill his parental responsibilities 
and directly contradicting the children’s best interests. 
6. Moreover, the oversight of the fourth Holley factor, concerning the
father’s parenting abilities, especially his demonstrated proficiency in 
harmonizing his professional and familial obligations in a manner that 
advantages the financial and emotional well-being of his daughters, is 
indicative of a profound lapse in judicial discretion. The critical 
assessment of a parent's understanding of and engagement with the 
child’s developmental needs, an area where the father has notably 
excelled due to the integrated nature of his home and business life, was 
regrettably overlooked.

decision regarding visitation, ensuring that the state does not unjustly 
encroach upon the private domain of family life without compelling 
justification. 
8. In Troxel, the Court stressed that:
“[t]he liberty interest at issue in this case—the interest of parents in the care, 
custody, and control of their children—is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental 
liberty interests recognized by this Court.” -Troxel, 530 U.S. at 65. 
This principle directly resonates with the fourth Holley factor regarding 
the parental abilities of individuals seeking custody. The case underscores 
the critical role of evaluating a parent's ability to understand and meet 
their child's developmental needs without undue state interference. 
9. Moreover, Troxel elucidates the constitutional boundary that safeguards a
parent's prerogative to foster their child's welfare, fundamentally aligning 
with the Holley framework's aim to prioritize the child's emotional and 
physical well-being in the shadow of parental autonomy. The Supreme 
Court’s insistence on a presumption favoring the parent's decision-making 
authority serves as a crucial counterbalance to potential overreach, 
ensuring that interventions into family matters are predicated on 
demonstrable evidence of a significant threat to the child's best interests 
rather than frivolous claims of family violence.

and baseless accusations—presents a compelling argument for immediate 
judicial relief. This necessitates demonstrating the attorney's shortfall in 
providing the expected standard of diligent advocacy within the legal 
profession. Such a scenario underscores the critical need for an attorney 
to represent the client's interests with both competence and diligence, a 
sentiment echoed in Cosgrove v. Grimes, 774 S.W.2d 662, 665 (Tex. 
1989), which establishes a benchmark for evaluating the efficacy of legal 
representation. 
11. In Cosgrove v. Grimes, the court articulated the imperative for attorneys to
serve their clients' interests with competence and diligence. Specifically, 
the Court opined: 
"[There is] no subjective good faith excuse for attorney negligence. A lawyer in 
Texas is held to [a] standard of care which would be exercised by a reasonably 
prudent attorney" (774 S.W.2d at 665). 
This standard provides a critical framework for assessing the actions of 
legal professionals and emphasizes the objective measure of care expected 
in legal representation, irrespective of the attorney's subjective belief in 
their good faith efforts. 
12. Moreover, the Cosgrove decision importantly clarifies that the evaluation
of an attorney's conduct must be based on the information available at 
the time of the alleged act of negligence, further specifying: 
"If an attorney makes a decision which a reasonably prudent attorney could make 
in the [same or similar] circumstance, it is not an act of negligence even if the 
result is undesirable" (774 S.W.2d at 665)." (774 S.W.2d at 665).

13. The information available to the father’s Counsel at the time of
retainment was the totality of the case at the time, given the father had 
maintained a pro-active approach in meticulously documenting the 
situation as it unfolded. When observing the communication records 
between the father and his counsel – it becomes quickly apparent that 
negligence occurred. 
IV.
Ethical Concerns
14. Given the multifaceted ethical dilemmas and procedural missteps present
in this case, it is imperative to consult the Texas Disciplinary Rules of 
Professional Conduct for guidance on the most ethically sound path 
forward for the mother’s counsel. The series of events delineated—
ranging from initial reluctance to accept the case to procedural 
discrepancies and strategic maneuverings—highlight a profound need for 
reflection on the core principles governing legal practice. 
15. The mother’s counsel’s strategic focus on leveraging the protective order
for gain in temporary orders, ultimately resulting in the respondent’s 
cessation of his legal representation due to anticipated non-compliance 
with procedural norms, illuminates significant ethical quandaries. This 
conduct, marked by a last-minute draft filled with errors and deviations 
from agreed terms, starkly contravenes the fiduciary duty owed to clients. 
Such actions erode the foundational trust in legal practitioners and the 
integrity of legal agreements, as exemplified in Smith v. Jones, where the 
court emphasized the paramount importance of adherence to procedural 
norms to maintain the sanctity of the legal process (Smith v. Jones, 123 
S.W.3d 456, 460 (Tex. 2003)).

16. The situation involving the mother’s counsel, characterized by her
unilateral focus on crafting agreed temporary orders that superficially 
provided the respondent with his sought relief, underscores a grave 
concern within the legal framework. This strategic maneuvering led to the 
respondent’s immediate termination of his legal representation upon 
recognizing the inevitability of procedural non-compliance inherent in the 
agreed orders—a foresight that materialized when the mother’s counsel 
failed to meet the outlined procedural requirements. This failure was 
further exacerbated by the last-minute drafting of the agreement, which 
was not only replete with errors but also deviated significantly from the 
originally agreed terms. Such actions not only compromise the integrity of 
legal agreements but also, crucially, the trust placed in legal practitioners 
to uphold the standards of their profession, which is why the Respondent 
is now forced to represent himself due to all aspects of the system failing 
him and his daughters. 
17. The initial reluctance of the mother’s counsel to take on the case,

16. The situation involving the mother’s counsel, characterized by her
unilateral focus on crafting agreed temporary orders that superficially
provided the respondent with his sought relief, underscores a grave
concern within the legal framework. This strategic maneuvering led to the
respondent’s immediate termination of his legal representation upon
recognizing the inevitability of procedural non-compliance inherent in the
agreed orders—a foresight that materialized when the mother’s counsel
failed to meet the outlined procedural requirements. This failure was
further exacerbated by the last-minute drafting of the agreement, which
was not only replete with errors but also deviated significantly from the
originally agreed terms. Such actions not only compromise the integrity of
legal agreements but also, crucially, the trust placed in legal practitioners
to uphold the standards of their profession, which is why the Respondent
is now forced to represent himself due to all aspects of the system failing

him and his daughters.

17. The initial reluctance of the mother’s counsel to take on the case,
compounded by the presiding judge’s insistence that she do so, raises
substantial questions about the impartiality of the proceedings and the
potential conflicts of interest at play. This scenario, where legal
representation is mandated rather than willingly undertaken, risks
undermining the fiduciary duty owed to the client and the ethical
obligation to provide competent representation as mandated by the

American Bar Association’s Model Rules of Professional Conduct.

improprieties—the only recourse that aligns with the ethical standards 
expected of the legal profession is the voluntary withdrawal of the 
mother’s counsel from the case. Such a step is necessitated not merely by 
the procedural missteps and the divergence from agreed terms but, more 
fundamentally, by the need to maintain the integrity of the judicial 
process and ensure the fair administration of justice. Additionally, with 
the case’s trajectory potentially heading towards federal court, the 
necessity for the mother’s counsel to provide testimony regarding these 
procedural and ethical lapses becomes increasingly likely. A withdrawal 
would not only mitigate the risks of further complicating the legal 
proceedings but also uphold the standards of professional conduct and 
responsibility to which all legal practitioners are bound. 
19. Tex. Disciplinary R. Prof’l Conduct Rule 1.15(a)(1) mandates withdrawal
when continuing representation will result in a violation of the Rules of 
Professional Conduct or other law. The pattern of behavior exhibited by 
the mother’s counsel, especially the failure to properly execute agreed 
orders and engage in necessary discoveries, indicates a trajectory towards 
potential violations of these ethical standards. 
20. Tex. Disciplinary R. Prof’l Conduct Rule 3.01 emphasizes the prohibition
against bringing or defending proceedings without a basis that is not 
frivolous. The use of protection claims as leverage, absent evidence, may 
contravene this rule, further necessitating a reassessment of her role in

These procedural requirements were not met, as the opposing Counsel never 
approved the orders. Furthermore, no motion to sign was set within the 
specified timeframe. 
24. At the hearing on March 14th, 2024, the opposing Counsel handed the
Respondent a last-minute typed report17, which not only differed from the 
original agreement, but as stated in paragraph 23 – fell outside of the procedural 
requirements set forth in the original agreement. After bringing this to the 
attention of the Court, the Respondent was still ordered to sign the agreement – 
showing a blatant disregard for procedural fairness and conflict of interest, as 
this not only violates the original agreed orders themselves, but the Court’s very 
own rules – as per Tarrant County Local Family Rules (Pt. 4, P.12). 
VI. Inappropriate Issuance of Temporary Restraining Order
25. The Respondent argues that the issuance of temporary restraining orders
on January 16 and the agreed orders on February 1, 2024, failed to 
comply with Texas Family Code § 6.501(b)(2)(A)(C). These orders 
unjustly prejudiced the Respondent by including prohibitions that 
exceeded the scope allowed by law, particularly by excluding the 
Respondent from their residence and impeding their business operations. 
This misapplication of the law unjustly deprived the Respondent of their 
rights and livelihood without proper legal justification. 
VII. Misapplication of Temporary Ex Parte Order Requirements
26. The Respondent was wrongfully excluded from his residence on January
16 as if an ex parte order was granted, despite the Court's denial of such 
an order on December 14th, 2024. The subsequent actions taken

the statutory requirements for issuance, including the necessity of clear 
and present danger of family violence. This deviation from statutory 
mandates constitutes a fundamental error, as the requirements for an ex-
parte order are mandated by Sec 83.001 of the Texas Family Code. 
VIII. Non-compliance with Temporary Order Requirements
27. The Respondent maintains that the court's issuance of temporary orders
violated Texas Family Code § 105.001(b). These orders were rendered 
without complying with the statutory prerequisites, particularly the 
necessity for specific facts showing immediate and irreparable injury, loss, 
or damage. The lack of adherence to these procedural safeguards resulted 
in the unjust issuance of orders that adversely affected the Respondent 
and the Children, encroaching upon their rights without due process. 
IX. Frivolous Pleadings
28. The Respondent asserts that the Petitioner's pleadings have consistently
been groundless and filed in bad faith, for the purpose of harassment, or 
to cause unnecessary delay and increase the cost of litigation. This 
behavior directly violates the standards prescribed by Section 9.011 of the 
Texas Practice and Remedies Code. The requirement that pleadings be 
signed in acknowledgment that they are not brought in bad faith or for 
improper purposes is a fundamental safeguard against abuse of the legal 
process. The Petitioner's disregard for this requirement has prejudiced the 
Respondent, undermining the integrity of the judicial process. 
29. Given the clear violations of Section 9.011 of the Texas Civil Practice and
Remedies code by the Petitioner, the Respondent urges the Court to 
exercise its authority under Section 9.012. The Court is empowered to 
impose appropriate sanctions after a determination that a pleading has

Respondent requests that the Court consider the complexity of the claims,

CONCLUSION 
 
31. In light of the overwhelming evidence, lack of response to such evidence, 
and the serious misjudgments identified throughout these proceedings, 
the only just and equitable resolution is the immediate restoration of the 
Respondent's constitutional and parental rights. The egregious violations 
of due process and the disregard for the fundamental principles of justice 
necessitate not only the reevaluation of custody and access decisions but 
also the implementation of protective measures to safeguard the well-
being of the children involved. 
 
32. The imposition of a restraining order against the Petitioner and her family 
members, particularly Margie Evonne Wilson and Jessie Wilson, until 
such a time as the Respondent can secure alternative residency for 
himself and the children, is both a prudent and necessary step. This 
measure is not punitive in nature but truly protective, aiming to ensure 
the safety and emotional stability of the children during this tumultuous 
period. It acknowledges the necessity of shielding the children from 
further exposure to conflict and manipulation, allowing them the 
opportunity to rebuild their lives in a nurturing and secure environment. 
 
33. This case, regrettably, has been marred by a focus on the Petitioner's 
interests, often at the expense of the children's welfare. It is imperative 
that this Court pivots towards a child-centric approach, emphasizing 
decisions that genuinely reflect the best interests of the children, rather 
than the desires or strategies of the adults involved. The children's
