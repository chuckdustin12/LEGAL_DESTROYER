To the Honorable John H. Cayce Jr.:
Respondent in the above styled cause, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, (“the

Respondent’’) submits this notice of intent to file mandamus to respectfully challenge the
orders entered into the record of cause number 322-744263-23 on May 20, 2025. This
notice is submitted in good faith to afford the Court an opportunity to vacate or correct

proceedings, warranting immediate corrective action to uphold this court’s impartiality

I. INTRODUCTION 
This Court overruled an objection filed by the Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN 
MYERS, which complained that the Court was deviating from Rule 18a of the Texas 
Rules of Civil Procedure by involving the judge’s personally appointed court coordinator 
in the process. The court then used the same rule to summarily deny relief. This selective 
use of Rule 18a defeats the entire purpose of the rule, undermines the recusal process, 
and serves the opposite effect of what the Legislature had intended.  
II. THE RECUSAL PROCESS 
Each party in this process has their own clear, designated role which is 
unambiguously set forth in the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure to ensure that the 
proceedings do not appear prejudicial or impartial after a question of impartiality has 
been raised.   
1. THE MOVANT 
The Movant’s responsibility is to comply with the requirements of Id. 18a(a) et seq., 
which the Court contends were not satisfied. However, compliance is a matter to be 
addressed only after the motion has been received and processed in accordance with the 
rule's mandatory transfer procedures. Once a motion is filed—regardless of perceived 
sufficiency—the initial responsibility shifts to the clerk of the Court. 
2. THE CLERK OF THE COURT 
The filing of the motion activates the clerk’s responsibility under Id. 18a(e)(1), which 
requires prompt delivery of the motion to both the Regional Presiding Judge and the

Rules of Civil Procedure by involving the judge’s personally appointed court coordinator
in the process. The court then used the same rule to summarily deny relief. This selective
use of Rule 18a defeats the entire purpose of the rule, undermines the recusal process,
and serves the opposite effect of what the Legislature had intended.
II. THE RECUSAL PROCESS
Each party in this process has their own clear, designated role which is

unambiguously set forth in the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure to ensure that the
proceedings do not appear prejudicial or impartial after a question of impartiality has
been raised.

1. THE MOVANT

The Movant’s responsibility is to comply with the requirements of Jd. 18a(a) et seq.,
which the Court contends were not satisfied. However, compliance is a matter to be
addressed only after the motion has been received and processed in accordance with the
rule's mandatory transfer procedures. Once a motion is filed—regardless of perceived
sufficiency—the initial responsibility shifts to the clerk of the Court.

2. THE CLERK OF THE COURT

The filing of the motion activates the clerk’s responsibility under Jd. 18a(e)(1), which

requires prompt delivery of the motion to both the Regional Presiding Judge and the

Respondent Judge. Upon completion of this task, the next procedural duty shifts to the 
Respondent Judge. 
3. THE RESPONDENT JUDGE 
Upon receipt of the motion from the clerk, the Respondent Judge is required to make 
one of two possible decisions set forth in Id. 18a(f)(1). He can either choose to recuse 
himself pursuant to Id. 18a(f)(1)(A) by filing with the clerk an order of recusal, or he can 
choose to file with the clerk an order of referral to the Regional Presiding Judge. When 
this decision is made, the procedural responsibility shifts back to the clerk, who must then 
comply with Id. 18a(e)(2) and deliver a copy of the decision made to the Regional 
Presiding Judge. 
4. THE REGIONAL PRESIDING JUDGE 
Upon receipt of a referred motion, the Regional Presiding Judge can either rule on the 
motion or assign a judge to rule pursuant to Id. 18a(g)(1). This portion in the chain of 
procedural responsibility is when a determination can be made regarding the Movant’s 
compliance with Id. 18a(a) et seq assuming all procedural requirements were followed, 
and no objections arise. 
5. FAILURE TO COMPLY 
If the Respondent Judge fails to comply with a duty imposed by the rule, the 
Relator reserves the right to “notify the Regional Presiding Judge”. Id. 18a(f)(3).  
Otherwise, Id. 18a(a) et seq. would now be fair game to attack the merits of the 
motion filed by the Respondent.

III. LEGAL ANALYSIS
In the instant matter, the recusal process was not followed in accordance 
with the procedure outlined above. The Respondent correctly invoked Texas Rule 
of Civil Procedure 18a(f)(3) by filing a timely objection to procedural deviations in 
the administration of the recusal proceedings. The objection identified two core 
issues: (1) the involvement of the court coordinator in the handling and forwarding 
of the recusal motion, and (2) the fact that the motion to recuse the Honorable Jeff 
Kaitcer was never formally filed in this cause number, thereby invalidating any 
referral or adjudication related to it. 
These two procedural irregularities, when viewed together, undermine the 
structural integrity of the recusal process and violate the mandatory requirements 
under Rule 18a. The rule does not permit informal substitution or delegation of 
duties to non-judicial actors such as court coordinators in matters as serious as 
judicial Recusal. If the Legislature had intended for a role designation in  this 
process for coordinators, it would be set forth in the Rule. By overruling this 
request on the grounds of 74.102(b) and leaving the issue of the Kaitcer motion 
unresolved, the Respondent filed a Petition for Writ of Mandamus in the Texas 
Supreme Court docketed under case No. 25-0426. However, without a stay in 
place, this Court had the ability to attack the merits of the motion, which were ripe 
for attack regardless of his filing of a Mandamus in the Texas Supreme Court.

IV. THE MOTION TO RECUSE
In the opening paragraph of the Amended Motion to Recuse Hon. James Munford, 
it states: 
“ 
The act of setting this case for final trial after sustaining over a year of 
irreparable harm while appellate proceedings remain unresolved is itself an act of 
partiality warranting mandatory recusal pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(b)(1) and 
18b(b)(2) on the grounds that the impartiality of the tribunal is reasonably in 
question, and there is a clear personal bias and prejudice exhibited towards the 
undersigned. This petition has been amended as the youngest child named in this 
suit has now sustained injury due to the collective negligence of the parties named 
herein, and the entire compiled case record has been attached. The statement of 
facts below highlights a clear bias towards the undersigned for reasons that can’t 
be attributed to the record. ” 
Pursuant to Rule 18a et seq. , the motion was verified, the motion stated with 
particularity the grounds for recusal pursuant to 18b, it provided a statement of facts 
reflecting the Respondent’s beliefs, provided direct links to the references which make up 
the foundation for those beliefs, and those references are self-authenticating documents, 
are part of the official court record, and therefore would be admissible into evidence. 
V. SUMMARY DENIAL
The Court’s decision to summarily deny the motion to recuse Hon. James Munford 
and also summarily deny a motion that was never filed raises the question as to what 
motion the court was reviewing, and if it was a true and accurate copy of the motion as 
filed with the clerk of the court.  While the Respondent respects this court’s engagement, 
the reasoning provided does not comport with the face of the motion. The bookmarks

it states:

provided in the PDF alone provide clear grounds for recusal that are not solely based on 
the judge’s rulings. Had the court summarily denied the motion on the grounds of 
timeliness – it would have been more appropriate and mandamus would not have been 
the appropriate method of attack.  
Here, the ruling on a motion which was never filed came after the involvement of 
the court coordinator who serves at the pleasure of the same Judge subject to recusal. See 
Tex. Gov’t. Code § 74.101(b). By introducing unnecessary ambiguity into these 
proceedings which have a clear process outlined in the Rules, the impartiality of the trial 
court remains in question, the summary denial does not comport with the motion filed, 
and the core issues of the case remain buried underneath procedural abnormalities that 
continue to compound. 
CONCLUSION AND PRAYER 
For all these reasons, the Respondent respectfully argues that it was an abuse of 
discretion to summarily deny the recusal motion regarding Hon. James Munford without 
a hearing. As stated across all four concurrent mandamus petitions currently pending in 
the Supreme Court of Texas, the Respondent and the Children continue to suffer ongoing 
harm while the Petitioner remains silent, her counsel refuses to prosecute, and the errors 
continue to compound, leaving the Respondent without an adequate remedy for relief. 
The Respondent prays the Court reconsider its’ denial and set this matter for a  hearing, or 
in the alternative, provide input in the Texas Supreme Court to effectuate justice. 
This situation warrants further clarification as it has no basis in Texas law.
