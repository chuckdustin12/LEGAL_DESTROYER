 (State/Tribe), you must begin withholding no 
later than the first pay period that occurs 
 days after the date of                         of the order/notice.  Send payment 
within 
 business days of the pay date.  If you cannot withhold the full amount of support for any or all orders for this 
employee/obligor, withhold 
 % of disposable income for all orders.  If the employee/obligor’s principal place of 
employment is not       
 (State/Tribe), obtain withholding limitations, time requirements, the appropriate 
method to allocate among multiple child support cases/orders and any allowable employer fees from the jurisdiction of 
the employee/obligor’s principal place of employment.

files/WHD/legacy/files/garn01.pdf.  If the Order Information section does not indicate that the arrears are greater than 12 
weeks, then the employer should calculate the CCPA limit using the lower percentage.
If there is more than one IWO against this employee/obligor and you are unable to fully honor all IWOs due to federal, 
state, or tribal withholding limits, you must honor all IWOs to the greatest extent possible, giving priority to current support 
before payment of any past-due support.
