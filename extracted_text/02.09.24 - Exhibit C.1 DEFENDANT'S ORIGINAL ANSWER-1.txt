Background Report for Case Consolidation

Case Details:

Divorce Case (Cause No. 322-744263-23) in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County, filed on
December 18, 2023.

Protective Order Case (Cause No. 322-744538-23) in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County.

Reasons for Consolidation:

Interconnected Issues:

The divorce case and the protective order case involve overlapping issues concerning family violence
allegations, which are central to the divorce proceedings and directly affect custody and visitation rights.
The protective order case includes allegations of family violence, which are also a pivotal point in the
divorce case in determining the waiver of the standard waiting period for the divorce.

Consistency in Rulings:

Consolidating the divorce and protective order cases would ensure consistency in the court's findings,
particularly regarding any allegations of family violence and their impact on the dissolution of marriage,
custody, and visitation rights.

Judicial Economy:

Hearing both cases together would promote judicial economy by avoiding duplication of legal
proceedings, as both cases are likely to involve similar witnesses, evidence, and legal arguments.

Claims of False Statements:

There have been claims of false statements and perjury related to the protective order, which could have
significant implications for the divorce case. For instance, the claim that the plaintiff intentionally lied
about being unable to pay court fees and made false allegations of family violence to gain an advantage
in the divorce proceedings suggests that a single judge should hear both matters for a clear
understanding of the facts.

Copy from re:SearchTX

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Copy from re:SearchTX
--- OCR TEXT ---
Evidence of Misrepresentation and False Statements:

Evidence provided suggests that there have been misrepresentations to the court, including the transfer
of funds from the joint account and the plaintiff's interaction with third parties, which could affect both
the protective order and the divorce outcome. The protective order — which was based on claims of
family violence — are entirely baseless as | have no record of family violence, and no evidence from the
Plaintiff has been provided to substantiate these claims.

Landlord-Tenant Relationship:

The eviction case, although not directly related to family law matters, stems from claims and actions that
are deeply intertwined with the divorce and protective order cases, suggesting that the alleged family
violence and the actions of the plaintiff have been used to justify an eviction that coincides with the
timing of the divorce and protective order filings.

Conclusion:

Given the overlapping factual and legal issues in the divorce and protective order cases, consolidation
would serve the interests of justice and efficiency. It would ensure that the court has a comprehensive
understanding of the intertwined nature of the family's circumstances, which is vital for fair and
equitable resolution of these matters. While the eviction case may not be directly consolidated due to
jurisdictional differences, it should be considered in context with the other cases to provide a complete
picture of the ongoing disputes and to keep the best interests of our children intact.

Respectfully submitted,

Charles Myers

iN THE DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS

BEFORE THE 322™° COURT

Morgan Michelle Myers, Plaintiff,
VS.
Charles Dustin Myers, Defendant.

CAUSE NO. 322-744538-23

MOTION FOR CONTINUANCE

TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT:

Comes now Charles Dustin Myers, Defendant in the above-entitled and numbered cause, respectfully
requests that the Court grant a continuance in the protective order case, and as grounds therefore would
show the following:

1, Family Priorities During Holidays: The recent holiday season and the children's break from school
have been my priority. Ensuring their stability and spending quality time with them has been of
utmost importance, impacting my ability to prepare adequately for this case.

2. Motion for Conselidation: | have recently filed a motion for consolidation to combine this case
with two others due to their intertwined nature. This motion has been accepted by the court but
not yet ruled upon by the judge. A decision on this matter could significantly impact the
proceedings of this case. The relevant cases that are intertwined are cause numbers: 322-
744263-23 (DIVORCE) and JP01-23-E00102017 (EVICTION).

Copy from re:SearchTX

=== PAGE 17 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Copy from re:SearchTX
--- OCR TEXT ---
3. Unfounded Claims in Eviction Suit and Protective Order: Both the eviction suit and the protective
order claims are unfounded. The eviction suit lists the violation of the lease as "granddaughter
divorced" and prematurely references the protective order as a secondary reason for eviction
grounds. Additional time is needed to address these premature and baseless claims. There is no
immediate danger to the Plaintiff, or the children — and has never been any incident of family
violence that has occurred within our home. Attached is a copy of my criminal history obtained
by the Texas Department of Public Safety that highlights my clean record.

4. Time to appropriately answer the divorce: The parent case in the request to consolidate is the
divorce, which | have yet to answer due to the concurrent proceedings (eviction suit and
protective order) which were both filed due to the claims that | possess a history of family
violence, waiving the 60-day period for service and making the timeframe unreasonable —
especially considering the lack of communications from the Plaintiffs — to formulate a plan that
best suits our children’s interests.

5. Lack of Cooperation in Providing Lease Agreement: Despite requests, the Plaintiff has not
provided a copy of the lease agreement necessary for my defense. More time is needed to
acquire these critical documents, especially given the unlawful nature of the eviction.

6. Potential for Amicable Resolution: Given more time to prepare and the pending decision on the
consolidation of cases, there is a potential for a more amicable resolution to be reached. The
intertwined nature of the cases suggests that a holistic approach to resolution may be more
appropriate and beneficial for all parties involved.

Considering the above reasons, continuity is necessary to ensure a fair and just resolution of this matter.
| assure the Court that this request is not for the purpose of delay, but to allow for adequate preparation
and the pursuit of justice.

WHEREFORE PREMISES CONSIDERED, |, Charles Dustin Myers, respectfully request that the Court grant a
continuance for the protective order case.

Respectfully submitted,

Car aer
