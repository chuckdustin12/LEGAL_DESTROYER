Ms. Weaver,

| appreciate your prompt response indicating the availability on March 14th. Due to the emergency nature of the
circumstances, and as outlined in my previous correspondence, a date on or before March 1st would be more
appropriate.

Please clarify if March 14th is the earliest live date available for this matter. If so, given the urgency, | propose an
alternative approach to expedite our discussions via video conference. This would allow us to address the urgent issues
at hand without further delay accommodating any scheduling conflicts.

If March 14th is indeed the earliest live date available for your office, please advise a date and time that works best on or
before March 1st, 2024 that we can schedule for a video conference hearing.

Upon your correspondence, | will draft the appropriate agreed motion and send it to your office for Ms. Carter's signature,
and notify the Court in accordance with Texas

Rules of Civil Procedure 21 d and Tarrant County Family Law Local Rules.

Your understanding and cooperation in finding a timely solution are greatly valued.

Best regards,
