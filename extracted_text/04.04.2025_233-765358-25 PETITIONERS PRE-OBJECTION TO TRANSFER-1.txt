NO. 233-765358-25 
 
IN THE 233RD DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
 
 
TO THE HONORABLE COURT: 
 
Petitioner, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, PRE-OBJECTS to any motion to transfer filed  
on behalf of COOPER L. CARTER in this matter, and in support thereof, shows the following: 
I. INTRODUCTION 
1. On March 28, 2025, Petitioner set a properly filed motion to be heard in front of the 
associate Judge. 
2. Petitioner was denied an opportunity to be heard due to the claim that COOPER L.  
CARTER would be filing a motion to consolidate in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County  
as justification for the denial of due process. 
 
3. On April 2nd, 2025, Petitioner filed a PRE-OBJECTION laying out the legal reasons  
why COOPER L. CARTER’s consolidation motion was improper, and premature. 
 
4. COOPER L. CARTER cannot move to consolidate this matter with the divorce suit  
pending before the 322nd District Court because the Texas Family Code 6.407(b) explicitly  
states: 
“On the transfer of the proceedings, the court with jurisdiction of the suit for dissolution of a 
marriage shall consolidate the two causes of action.”

Respondent.

2025-04-04

TO THE HONORABLE COURT:
Petitioner, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, PRE-OBJECTS to any motion to transfer filed
on behalf of COOPER L. CARTER in this matter, and in support thereof, shows the following:
I. INTRODUCTION

1. On March 28, 2025, Petitioner set a properly filed motion to be heard in front of the
associate Judge.

2. Petitioner was denied an opportunity to be heard due to the claim that COOPER L.
CARTER would be filing a motion to consolidate in the 322™ District Court of Tarrant County
as justification for the denial of due process.

3. On April 2"¢, 2025, Petitioner filed a PRE-OBJECTION laying out the legal reasons
why COOPER L. CARTER’s consolidation motion was improper, and premature.

4. COOPER L. CARTER cannot move to consolidate this matter with the divorce suit
pending before the 322" District Court because the Texas Family Code 6.407(b) explicitly
States:

“On the transfer of the proceedings, the court with jurisdiction of the suit for dissolution of a
marriage shall consolidate the two causes of action.”

5. Therefore, COOPER L. CARTER’s motion to consolidate is procedurally improper, and was  
used as a tool to interfere with emergency proceedings where no answer was provided. 
 
6. The court cannot refuse to hear a properly filed motion before it and give deference to an  
improperly filed motion notwithstanding COOPER L. CARTER’s misconduct and failure to prosecute the  
divorce suit. 
II. CONCLUSION 
 
7. For these reasons, Petitioner respectfully OBJECTS to any motion to transfer filed on behalf of  
COOPER L. CARTER. 
 
8. Furthermore, before any motion to transfer is to be set by COOPER L. CARTER, her authority  
pursuant to Rule 12 should be resolved by citing COOPER L. CARTER to appear and prove her authority  
to represent the Respondent in this matter. 
 
 
Respectfully submitted,
