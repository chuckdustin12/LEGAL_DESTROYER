However, since December 2023, there has been a notable decline in the 
reliability and efficiency of the service provided. This shift coincides with Mr. 
Myers facing significant person~! and legal challenges, including a divorce 
proceeding that h~s drasti<?ally 1n:1pacted his ability to operate his business 
effectively. A particularly distressing development for Mr. Myers has been his 
inability to access the physical location where his business equipment and 
data connections are housed. This situation has not only disrupted the service 
but has also imposed significant financial difficulties on Mr. Myers, threatening 
the sustainability of the business and the quality of service that customers 
have come to expect. 
The repercussions of these challenges have been felt deeply by both Mr. 
Myers and his clientele. While the community understands and sympathizes 
with Mr. Myers' personal struggles, the increasing service disruptions have 
raised concerns among users about the future reliability and viability of the 
service. We are hopeful for a resolution that will allow Mr. Myers to regain 
access to his business infrastructure, thereby restoring the service quality and 
reliability that we have valued highly. It is in the interest of both Mr. Myers and 
his customers to find a solution that addresses these operational challenges 
while supporting him through his personal difficulties, ensuring the long-term 
success and sustainability of the service.
