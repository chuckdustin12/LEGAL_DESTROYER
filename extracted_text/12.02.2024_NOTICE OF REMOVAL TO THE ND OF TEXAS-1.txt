I. INTRODUCTION

This case transcends traditional domestic disputes, presenting significant constitutional and
procedural violations that require federal intervention. Between December 14 and December 29th,
2023, the Defendant discovered over 16,500 text messages dating from October 2022 to January
2024 between the Plaintiff and two third parties, Damen Kazlauskas and Debbie Price. (See DKT In
response, Plaintiff Morgan Michelle Myers initiated a flurry of lawsuits, including multiple ex-parte
attempts, the quantity of which remains unknown. (See DKT 1, page 7; see also DKT 2, 27, 8, 29, 31,
32, 33, 12, 42, and 44). While Defendant was home with the Children preparing for the Christmas
holiday, Plaintiff was filing pleading after pleading in an effort to have the Defendant removed from
the family residence.

On January 16, 2024, these efforts manifested, and Defendant was ordered to vacate the
family residency within four hours’ notice. The court effectively called the Defendant before it to
present his best defense only to then be denied that very opportunity. (DKT 53) Subsequent
proceedings were further weaponized by Plaintiff these unconstitutional orders, leading to their
reduction and entry over the Defendant's objections during a hearing ostensibly convened to address
his challenges (DKT 78). What began as procedural violations has escalated into a sustained
deprivation of the Defendant's constitutional rights.

To date, all pleadings filed by the Defendant remain un-opposed. No final trial has been
scheduled, and the Defendant's pursuit of relief through state remedies has yielded no results.
Intervention by this Court is crucial to restore procedural integrity and ensure the Defendant's
fundamental rights under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth
Amendmentare rightfully restored. This removal is filed in good faith, and all statements made herein
are accurate and true to the best of the Defendant’s knowledge.

Justice requires that this court step in and restore integrity to these proceedings.

II. GROUNDS FOR REMOVAL 
The undersigned requests that the court assume jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 
28 U.S.C. § 1331 because this case raises substantial federal questions involving violations of the 
Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and the State’s total 
failure to uphold these fundamental safeguards. Plaintiff’s actions, combined with the state 
court’s initial decision based on those actions, deprived Defendant of his home, business, and 
custody of his children at the outset of the litigation without the federally guaranteed protections 
of due process nor the evidentiary findings required by law at the conclusion of a show cause 
hearing brought under Title 4 of the Texas Family Code. (See Sec. 85.001, Tex. Fam. Code, 
stating “[a]t the close of a hearing on an application for a protective order, the court shall find 
whether family violence has occurred.”).  
 
Here, no formal findings were entered, which remains the case to date. The record, as 
reflected in DKT. 19, shows that the Defendant was ordered to vacate his residence only after a 
continuance had been granted to both parties by the court—an agreement made with the intent of 
gathering additional evidence and ensuring procedural fairness. This continuance was 
particularly significant as it provided a crucial opportunity for both parties to adequately prepare 
their respective cases. However, the subsequent decision to evict the Defendant undermined the 
procedural fairness that the delay was intended to afford. Notably, this initial ruling was issued 
before either party had secured legal representation and was rendered on the only day in 2024 
that the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County was officially closed due to inclement weather.

III. JURISDICTION

federal intervention to address grave constitutional violations under the 14th Amendment.

In compliance with due process, a state seeking to interfere with a parent's

hearing until the order was presented to the court. Notwithstanding the federal guarantee 
of due process and equal protection that was disregarded, the state court has also failed to 
abide by its own laws when it disregarded this safeguard.  
 
The Defendant doesn’t ask this court to review a final state court decision or 
interfere with state court proceedings, but rather asks of this court to either dissolve or 
declare void a fundamentally and procedurally defective order which was procured by 
extrinsic fraud, and which was prosecuted by an attorney who has no authority to do so. 
Only until this happens can the case move forward, which has remained stagnant since 
February 1st, 2024. 
 
If the entire State system fails to properly adjudicate because it chose to adopt 
fraud over fact, will this court step in and restore justice? Typically, there are many 
procedural hurdles to federal jurisdiction which the Defendant turns to address.  
IV. THE YOUNGER ABSTENTION 
 
In general, the Younger doctrine requires that federal courts decline to exercise 
jurisdiction over lawsuits “when three conditions are met: (1) the federal proceeding would 
interfere with an ‘ongoing state judicial proceeding'; (2) the state has an important interest in 
regulating the subject matter of the claim; and (3) the [defendant] has ‘an adequate opportunity 
in the state proceedings to raise constitutional challenges.'” Bice v. La. Pub. Def. Bd., 677 F.3d 
712, 716 (5th Cir. 2012) (quoting Middlesex Cnty. Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar Ass'n, 457 
U.S. 423, 432, (1982)). If these “three prerequisites are satisfied, then a federal court can assert 
jurisdiction only if ‘certain narrowly delimited exceptions to the abstention doctrine apply.'” Id. 
(quoting Tex. Ass'n of Bus. v. Earle, 388 F.3d 515, 519 (5th Cir. 2004)). In the present case, the

hearing until the order was presented to the court. Notwithstanding the federal guarantee

IV. THE YOUNGER ABSTENTION

In general, the Younger doctrine requires that federal courts decline to exercise
jurisdiction over lawsuits “when three conditions are met: (1) the federal proceeding would
interfere with an ‘ongoing state judicial proceeding’; (2) the state has an important interest in
regulating the subject matter of the claim; and (3) the [defendant] has ‘an adequate opportunity
in the state proceedings to raise constitutional challenges.”’ Bice v. La. Pub. Def. Bd., 677 F.3d

U.S. 423, 432, (1982)). If these “three prerequisites are satisfied, then a federal court can assert
jurisdiction only if “certain narrowly delimited exceptions to the abstention doctrine apply.”” Jd.

(quoting Tex. Ass'n of Bus. v. Earle, 388 F.3d 515, 519 (Sth Cir. 2004)). In the present case, the

third prong of the younger abstention doesn’t apply. Defendant has exhausted all state remedies, 
including administrative remedies, to no avail and without any explanation outside of the latest 
denial. (DKT 251). But even here, much like the outset of the case, this denial highlights a one-
sided favoritism benefiting the Plaintiff. (See DKT 48) The state court has made it clear that it 
refuses to address the core issues surrounding this matter. 
 
Even if the Defendant did have an adequate forum to vindicate his federally protected 
rights in the State courts, the suit leading to the deprivation of his rights was brought in bad faith 
by Plaintiff, and if relief is not granted, the extraordinary circumstances of this case will cause 
further ‘irreparable loss [that] is both great and immediate.', as each day that these issues remain 
dormant adds to the irreparable loss caused by the Petitioner’s false claims and the State’s actions 
based on those claims. See Gates v. Strain, 885 F.3d 874, 880 (5th Cir. 2018) (quoting Younger v. 
Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 45, 53-54 (1971)). The harm to the children’s emotional development is 
immeasurable and requires intervention. The current orders are not a final state court judgement, 
and  the Defendant is not a state court loser. The appellate process yielded no opinion and no 
results, and the Defendant does not seek this court’s appellate jurisdiction, but only its’ duty to 
uphold the law where the other forum has failed.  
V. THE ROOKER-FELDMAN DOCTRINE 
The Supreme Court has repeatedly noted that the Rooker-Feldman doctrine is a narrow 
jurisdictional bar. Lance v. Dennis, 546 U.S. 459, 464 (2006) (per curiam); Exxon Mobil 
Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., 544 U.S. at 283 (2005). The doctrine is designed to prevent 
lower federal courts from exercising jurisdiction over matters that are exclusively reserved for 
Supreme Court review under 28 U.S.C. § 1257. Lance, 546 U.S. at 463. Accordingly, this 5th 
Circuit has limited the application of Rooker-Feldman to those cases in which "a party suffered

an adverse final judgment rendered by a state's court of last resort." Ill. Cent. R. Co. v. Guy, 682 
F.3d 381, 390 (5th Cir. 2012). Because the Defendant is not asking this court to review a final 
judgement rendered by a state court of last resort, the Rooker-Feldman doctrine should not bar 
federal jurisdiction over this removal.  
The orders in question were rendered as an agreement between the parties. To see the 
fraud upon the court, one needs to look no further than DKT 92, page 1, as it claims the parties 
agree to the terms of the order ‘as evidenced by the signatures below’, and that the parties 
‘appeared on February 1, 2024, to hear Petitioner’s motion for temporary orders. However, when 
looking at the docket sheet, the only appearance made by the Plaintiff in this matter occurred on 
January 16th, 2024, when she was awarded on all issues and Defendant was deprived of those 
same issues prior to any adjudication taking place, and his signature on the document is not 
present. This has left the Defendant seeking relief throughout the State system to no avail to the 
point where he has exhausted all state remedies to vindicate his constitutionally protected rights 
despite receiving no response or opposition from the other side. 
VI. EXHAUSTION OF STATE REMEDIES 
 
From the outset of the case, Defendant has diligently been pursuing answers regarding 
the procedural posture of this case. How can both parties agree to a continuance, and only one of 
those parties be deprived of substantial interests without any findings being entered into the 
record? How can the Plaintiff file multiple frivolous lawsuits to damage Defendant, and when 
that effort comes to fruition, leverage the Defendant’s deprivation against him? When the basis 
for the settlement is challenged on reconsideration, how can the court refuse to re-visit the initial 
decision made in the case and order him to sign an agreement he doesn’t consent to? (DKT 78). 
These questions were presented to the second court of appeals and the Texas Supreme Court,

who declined to take the case, necessitating this court’s oversight. The state’s failure to 
adjudicate this matter should be unacceptable in the eyes of the law, especially given that the 
Plaintiff has raised no defenses against any claims brought forth against her, nor argued against 
any relief sought by the Defendant.  
VII. UNAUTHORIZED PROSECUTION 
 
This case presents an anomalous scenario wherein the party originally deprived of their 
rights at the outset remains the sole actor actively engaged in the litigation. The docket is entirely 
composed of unopposed motions filed by the Defendant, none of which have garnered any 
response from either the court or the Plaintiff. Notably, this includes a motion for partial 
summary judgment filed on February 26, 2024 (DKT 68), as well as a request for discovery and 
admissions (DKT 249). The complete lack of engagement from the opposing party throughout 
the appellate process further exacerbates the procedural stagnation, raising grave concerns about 
due process and judicial oversight.  
 
The Plaintiff's only discernible effort to advance their position emerged through a motion 
for a pre-trial conference filed on April 24, 2024 (DKT 206), which was promptly contested by 
the Defendant (DKT 207). Both the motion and the corresponding objection remain unaddressed 
by the court, leaving the case mired in procedural ambiguity. Moreover, the Texas Office of the 
Attorney General (OAG) sought to intervene in the proceedings on June 28, 2024 (DKT 216), 
which was also immediately objected to by the Defendant (DKT 217). To date, neither the 
intervention motion nor the subsequent objection has been resolved by the court, and the OAG 
has since ceased all participation, limiting its involvement to the initial filing. 
 
The Plaintiff's representation itself remains shrouded in uncertainty. Of the few 
substantive filings from the Plaintiff, the legitimacy of representation is in serious question.

which was also immediately objected to by the Defendant (DKT 217). To date, neither the
intervention motion nor the subsequent objection has been resolved by the court, and the OAG
has since ceased all participation, limiting its involvement to the initial filing.

The Plaintiff's representation itself remains shrouded in uncertainty. Of the few

substantive filings from the Plaintiff, the legitimacy of representation is in serious question.

Specifically, two filings beyond the initial pleadings were submitted ostensibly "on behalf of 
Cooper Carter by Roderick Marx" (DKT 21, DKT 206). This circumstance is troubling, as 
publicly accessible information from Cooper L. Carter's LinkedIn and Facebook profiles indicate 
her departure from the law firm Marx, Altman, & Johnson in 2022. This discrepancy between her 
professed employment status and her purported role in the current litigation gives rise to serious 
concerns regarding the legitimacy and propriety of the representation. 
 
The matter of Ms. Carter's authority was properly challenged on September 20, 2024 
(DKT 222). This issue is of paramount importance, particularly given that Ms. Carter prepared 
the current orders which were rendered as an agreement at a hearing meant to challenge them. 
These orders reference another hearing held on February 1st which never occurred, a motion that 
was never served on the Defendant, and claims to be agreed with only the signatures of one party 
appearing on the document. Pursuant to Rule 12 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, if her 
authority cannot be substantiated, the State court is mandated to bar unauthorized counsel from 
participating in the matter. Furthermore, the court must strike any pleadings submitted without 
proper authorization if no duly authorized representative appears to prosecute or defend the 
action. The implications of unauthorized counsel drafting orders integral to these proceedings are 
profound, directly undermining the validity of the ongoing litigation. 
 
A further perplexing element in this case is the abrupt cessation of involvement by the 
Texas OAG. This development warrants rigorous scrutiny, particularly in light of the fact that 
Holly Hayes, the attorney who signed on behalf of the OAG, publicly announced her departure 
from the agency in 2018 via Facebook. Furthermore, her LinkedIn profile indicates her current 
employment as a General Attorney with the Small Business Administration (SBA) in Irving, 
Texas. These inconsistencies suggest either a fraudulent intervention filing or recognition by the

OAG that it was pursuing relief based on a void and legally ineffective order. Additionally, and 
perhaps most perplexing, is the fact that the almighty Texas OAG has stopped pursuing relief to 
establish, enforce, and collect child support.  
VIII. TIMELINESS OF REMOVAL 
 
The timeliness of removal is a procedural rather than a jurisdictional issue and, 
accordingly, may be waived by an untimely objection. See Hartford Accident Indem. Co. v. Costa 
Lines Cargo Servs., Inc., 903 F.2d 352, 359-60 (5th Cir. 1990). Defendant reserves his argument 
for timelines if an objection is filed by Plaintiff’s counsel, which would be the first documented 
response filed thus far in the matter.  
XII. CONCLUSION 
Defendant, Charles Dustin Myers, respectfully submits that this case exemplifies the kind 
of extraordinary circumstances necessitating federal intervention to avert further irreparable 
harm and to restore fundamental constitutional safeguards. The procedural irregularities, 
fraudulent misrepresentations, and deprivation of Defendant's core constitutional rights have 
rendered the state proceedings fundamentally inequitable and incapable of achieving justice. The 
state court's failure to address unopposed motions, rectify procedural defects, and enforce its own 
regulations has effectively deprived the Defendant of any adequate remedy at the state level. 
Federal oversight is imperative to protect Defendant’s rights to due process and equal 
protection under the law, while also reinstating procedural integrity in the underlying divorce 
action. Intervention by this Court is crucial to address egregious constitutional violations, 
establish a precedent for procedural fairness, and ensure that state courts operate within the 
confines of both state and federal law, particularly when adjudicating matters that directly impact 
the litigant’s livelihood and, by extension, the welfare of minor children.

The Defendant’s business has been destroyed because of the current orders (DKT 215, at 
19), and his relationship with his children has suffered irrevocable damage. Defendant simply 
requests that this Court permit him to return to the home from which he was unjustly expelled 
without any legitimate basis, and remand the remaining issues back to the State so that it may 
properly adjudicate the divorce matters in accordance with legal standards. At present, the case 
lacks a clear trajectory, is not being actively prosecuted, and the facts and assertions stated herein 
remain uncontested and apparent from the docket. This is not how divorce proceedings should be 
managed by our State courts. The inadvertent victims of these deficiencies are the children, 
whose future is fundamentally tied to the well-being of this nation. Their best interests should 
command more consideration than what has been afforded in this matter, and the Plaintiff’s 
actions should not be  taken lightly given she has made no defense to any claims made against 
her while the Defendant has fought vigorously to restore stability to his Children’s lives. 
XIII. PRAYER FOR EXPEDITED RELIEF 
WHEREFORE, Defendant respectfully petitions this Honorable Court as follows: 
1. To assume jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, in recognition of 
the significant federal issues and extraordinary constitutional violations implicated 
herein; 
2. To declare void ab initio the orders rendered in this matter, which were procured through 
procedural defects, fraudulent misrepresentations, and egregious violations of 
Defendant’s fundamental rights under the Fourteenth Amendment; 
3. To issue a preliminary injunction:
