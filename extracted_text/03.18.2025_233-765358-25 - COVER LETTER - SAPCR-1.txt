Re: Original Petition in Suit Affecting Parent-Child Relationship (“SAPCR”) – Request to 
File as Separate Case and Set Immediate Hearing (In the Interest of [M.M.] and [C.M.], 
minor children; related to Cause No. 322-744263-23, In re Marriage of Myers) 
Dear Mr. Wilder and Honorable Court: 
Please accept for filing the enclosed Original SAPCR concerning the above-referenced 
children. This SAPCR is intentionally filed as a new, separate case, rather than under the 
existing divorce cause, due to unique procedural defects in that divorce proceeding that have left 
the children in legal and physical limbo. Immediate intervention is required to protect the 
children’s best interests. Below, I outline the compelling reasons – supported by law and the 
record – why this SAPCR must proceed separately and be set for an emergency hearing at 
once, instead of being merged into the stalled divorce case. 
A. Failure of Opposing Party to Prosecute
1. The divorce Petitioner has wholly failed to prosecute the divorce, leaving it in
procedural limbo. Over a year has passed with no meaningful activity toward a final resolution. 
Notably, after the divorce case was removed to federal court and later remanded, Petitioner 
never filed the required certified Order of Remand or gave notice of remand as mandated by 
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 237a. Rule 237a obligates the removing party to promptly file the 
federal remand order with the state clerk and notify all parties, after which any defendant has 15 
days to answer. Petitioner’s omission of this required step has left the state court record 
incomplete and the case procedurally suspended. Indeed, due to Petitioner’s inaction (and her

Re: Original Petition in Suit Affecting Parent-Child Relationship (““SAPCR”’) — Request to
File as Separate Case and Set Immediate Hearing (In the Interest of [M.M.] and [C.M.],
minor children; related to Cause No. 322-744263-23, In re Marriage of Myers)

Dear Mr. Wilder and Honorable Court:

Please accept for filing the enclosed Original SAPCR concerning the above-referenced
children. This SAPCR is intentionally filed as a new, separate case, rather than under the
existing divorce cause, due to unique procedural defects in that divorce proceeding that have left
the children in legal and physical limbo. Immediate intervention is required to protect the
children’s best interests. Below, I outline the compelling reasons — supported by law and the
record — why this SAPCR must proceed separately and be set for an emergency hearing at

once, instead of being merged into the stalled divorce case.
A. Failure of Opposing Party to Prosecute

1. The divorce Petitioner has wholly failed to prosecute the divorce, leaving it in
procedural limbo. Over a year has passed with no meaningful activity toward a final resolution.
Notably, after the divorce case was removed to federal court and later remanded, Petitioner
never filed the required certified Order of Remand or gave notice of remand as mandated by
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 237a. Rule 237a obligates the removing party to promptly file the
federal remand order with the state clerk and notify all parties, after which any defendant has 15
days to answer. Petitioner’s omission of this required step has left the state court record

incomplete and the case procedurally suspended. Indeed, due to Petitioner’s inaction (and her

M.2260

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
counsel’s apparent inability to e-file; see Point 8 below), no remand notice was ever filed, so 
the divorce court has not resumed jurisdiction in any practical sense. 
2. In addition, Petitioner has ignored the Texas Supreme Court’s time standards for
timely disposition of cases. A divorce case is expected to be resolved within 12 months, yet 
Petitioner has made no effort to advance it. She has not set a trial or even a status conference; she 
has allowed critical deadlines to lapse. This lack of diligence violates the duty to prosecute one’s 
claims and warrants dismissal for want of prosecution. In fact, Respondent has been forced to 
file a Motion to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution (pending before the Court) detailing 
Petitioner’s complete failure to move the case forward. This also remains un-responded to. 
Petitioner’s inaction has left the family with no active forum to address urgent child-related 
issues. Therefore, a separate SAPCR is necessary to provide a functioning vehicle for relief. 
The children cannot wait for the Petitioner’s indifference or strategic delay to abate. 
B. Failure to Oppose Any Relief (Legal Concession)
3. Throughout the divorce case, Petitioner has not opposed or responded to any of
Respondent’s filings, motions, or claims for relief. She and her counsel have remained silent in 
the face of serious allegations and requests, effectively conceding the merits of those issues 
under Texas law. Respondent has raised grave claims of fraud, perjury, deception, and child 
neglect against Petitioner in his pleadings, yet Petitioner’s counsel has filed no response or 
defense to these claims. Respondent also served discovery and Requests for Admissions which 
went completely unanswered, resulting in deemed admissions. He even filed a motion to 
compel discovery, which Petitioner again did not oppose, though unfortunately no hearing has 
yet been held. Moreover, when Respondent moved for other interim relief (including return to 
the family home and expanded access to the children), Petitioner filed no opposition. By her

inaction, Petitioner has implicitly admitted the validity of Respondent’s factual assertions and 
the justness of his requests.  
4. Texas law is clear that a party who fails to respond to motions or claims effectively
waives any objection and accepts the movant’s evidence as true. For example, in the 
summary judgment context, if a nonmovant files no response, the court may accept the movant’s 
asserted facts as uncontroverted and render judgment if entitlement is shown; issues not timely 
raised in a written response are waived; see Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c). The same principle applies 
here: Petitioner’s total failure to contest Respondent’s filings is tantamount to a legal concession 
of those matters. In other words, failure to make timely and specific objections results in waiver 
of the objections. See Clark v. Trailways, Inc., 774 S.W.2d 644, 647 (Tex. 1989), cert. denied, 
493 U.S. 1074, 110 S.Ct. 1122, 107 L.Ed.2d 1028 (1990); Hartford Accident and Indem. Co. v. 
McCardell, 369 S.W.2d 331, 335 (Tex. 1963); Srite v. Owens-Illinois, Inc., 870 S.W.2d 556, 565 
(Tex.App. — Houston [1st Dist.] 1993), revised on other grounds, 897 S.W.2d 765). Courts have 
recognized that a party’s failure to respond indicates a belief that the motion has merit.  
5. Petitioner’s silence speaks volumes. She has never disputed that Respondent should be
allowed to return home or see his children – in fact, she has not opposed any relief requested. 
This silence should be treated as acquiescence. Accordingly, there is no reason to keep the 
children waiting in the paralytic divorce case when no one is even arguing against the relief 
Respondent seeks in this SAPCR. The SAPCR can and should proceed on the uncontroverted 
facts in Respondent’s filings.

6. Every day that passes with the children separated from their father is a day of
irreparable harm. The undisputed evidence is that the children are suffering due to 
Respondent’s forced absence from the home. In the months since he was excluded, the children’s 
well-being has precipitously declined: they have fallen behind in school, missed critical medical 
and dental appointments, and have been emotionally traumatized by the sudden and prolonged 
separation from their father. No party—not even Petitioner—has asserted that the children would 
be anything but better off if their father could return to care for them. No one has argued against 
Respondent’s return to the home or his involvement in the children’s daily life. It is axiomatic 
that the best interest of the children is the paramount concern in any case affecting the parent-
child relationship. See Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002 (mandating that “[t]he best interest of the 
child shall always be the primary consideration of the court in determining the issues of 
conservatorship and possession of and access to the child”); Lenz v. Lenz, 79 S.W.3d 10, 14 
(Tex. 2002) (emphasizing that courts must place “predominant emphasis” on what best serves the 
children's welfare, particularly focusing on stability, emotional and educational needs, and 
maintaining frequent contact with fit parents). 
7. The Texas Legislature explicitly prioritized children’s best interests in all
conservatorship and possession determinations: “The best interest of the child shall always be 
the primary consideration of the court in determining the issues of conservatorship and 
possession of and access to the child.” Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002. Texas Supreme Court 
jurisprudence confirms and expands upon this legislative directive, instructing courts to consider 
stability, educational continuity, emotional health, and ongoing relationships with fit parents in 
their best-interest analysis. See Lenz, 79 S.W.3d at 14–15 (holding courts must evaluate what

will best serve the child’s overall welfare, ensuring a stable and emotionally supportive 
environment and maintaining meaningful and frequent parental contact). 
8. Here, it is unquestionably in the children's best interests to have their loving father
back in their daily lives without further delay. Texas public policy explicitly states that children 
should have frequent and continuing contact with parents who have demonstrated the ability to 
act in their best interest. See Tex. Fam. Code § 153.001(a) (declaring the public policy of 
Texas to ensure frequent contact and shared duties between parents and children following 
separation); Lenz, 79 S.W.3d at 14–15 (affirming that Texas policy favors maintaining 
frequent and meaningful parental involvement in a child's life). 
9. Respondent has demonstrated throughout these proceedings that he is a caring, fit
parent whose presence provides the children with stability, support for their education and health, 
and emotional security. By contrast, the children’s current situation—living apart from 
Respondent for no substantiated reason—is destabilizing and harmful. Texas courts recognize the 
urgency of child custody matters and have repeatedly underscored that “justice demands a 
speedy resolution of child custody and child support issues.” In re Tex. Dep’t of Fam. & 
Protective Servs., 210 S.W.3d 609, 613 (Tex. 2006) (orig. proceeding) (quoting Proffer v. 
Yates, 734 S.W.2d 673, 674 (Tex. 1987)). Simply put, the children’s needs cannot wait on 
procedural formalities or a dormant divorce case. Their welfare requires this SAPCR to be heard 
immediately so that orders can be promptly put in place to reunite them with their father and 
address their academic, emotional, and medical needs. No statute or rule forbids initiating a 
separate SAPCR when it is necessary to protect children's best interests. Indeed, Tex. Fam. Code 
§ 153.002 and the overarching equitable duty of the Court compel swift action here. Respondent
is ready, willing, and able to resume caring for his children, and no party has objected to him

serve the children's best interests without further delay. See Lenz, 79 S.W.3d at 14–15 (holding

D. Fraud and Perjury Render the Prior Orders Void
10. The orders entered in the divorce case that currently keep Respondent out of the home
and away from the children were obtained through fraud, misrepresentation, and even 
perjury. Because those orders were procured by wrongful means, they are void ab initio and 
cannot be permitted to stand in the way of this SAPCR. Texas law does not tolerate court orders 
obtained by trickery or false pretenses. Notably, the temporary orders in the divorce (signed 
January 16, 2024 and later on March 14, 2024) were presented to the Court as “agreed” orders, 
yet Respondent never agreed to them and never signed them. In fact, Respondent had 
expressly opposed the relief in those orders. The “agreement” was a fiction created by 
Petitioner’s counsel. The record reflects that Petitioner’s counsel drafted and submitted those 
orders without Respondent’s consent or signature, and which reference a hearing not found on 
the docket. This is a textbook example of a fraud on the court. A judgment or order entered as 
“agreed” when one party actually objected is void. The Texas Supreme Court’s holding in 
Burnaman v. Heaton is directly on point: when a trial court knows a party does not consent to a 
purported agreed judgment, it must refuse to sign it; any judgment rendered under such 
circumstances “is void.” Burnaman v. Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 (Tex. 1951). 
11. Here, the court was misled – it was never disclosed that Respondent vehemently
disagreed. Without such consent the judgment is void. The law will not give effect to a 
“party’s consent” that was never actually given. Moreover, the way those orders were obtained

was rife with material falsehoods. In her filings, Petitioner knowingly made false statements to 
the Court to justify excluding Respondent from the home. For example, in her Application for 
Protective Order and supporting affidavit, Petitioner grossly misrepresented the facts, painting 
Respondent as a danger without evidence. She alleged incidents that never occurred or twisted 
mundane events into false claims of “family violence.” These misrepresentations were later 
exposed, and Petitioner has never attempted to prove them in any evidentiary hearing. 
Petitioner’s intent was plainly to deceive the Court into granting her sole occupancy of the home 
and custody of the children. Indeed, Respondent’s pending Motion to Dismiss details how 
Petitioner “knowingly made and presented fraudulent claims to the Court regarding 
Respondent’s property, with the intent to deprive him of his interest in his home”, and how 
she acted with intent that “these false claims be given the same legal effect as valid court orders, 
misleading the Court and causing Respondent to be wrongfully deprived of his home and 
livelihood.” 
12. These strong findings, which stand uncontroverted, show that the prior orders were
procured by fraud and deception. Under longstanding Texas precedent, any order obtained by 
extrinsic fraud (fraud that effectively prevents a fair presentation of the case) is void and a 
nullity. See King Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman, 118 S.W.3d 742, 751–52 (Tex. 2003) (judgment 
obtained by fraud can be set aside; only extrinsic fraud – such as keeping a party away from 
court or concealing critical facts – justifies relief).  
13. Here, Petitioner’s fraud was extrinsic in that it kept Respondent from participating
fully (the “agreed” order ploy) and kept the Court from learning the true facts. A litigant who 
lies to gain advantage in a court order subverts the process; the resulting order lacks integrity 
and is void.

14. In sum, the prior temporary orders that ousted Respondent were built on a
foundation of fraud. They should carry no weight and pose no obstacle to granting relief in this 
new SAPCR. This Court not only has the authority to declare such orders void, it has a duty to 
do so in order to prevent manifest injusticec. See Burnaman, 240 S.W.2d at 291. By proceeding 
with a fresh SAPCR, the Court can consider the issues regarding the children de novo, on truthful 
evidence, untainted by the false premises of the earlier orders. Equity regards as done that which 
ought to have been done – the Court should restore Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, 
(Petitioner in the new cause) to his rightful place in the home and children’s lives, as if the 
fraudulent orders had never been entered. 
E. Restoring the True Status Quo of the Family
15. Relief in this SAPCR is also warranted to restore the status quo that existed before
Petitioner’s improper actions. The “last actual, peaceable status quo” in this family was 
Respondent living in the home with the children, as a present and active father. That was the 
reality until late 2023, when Petitioner – through unilateral false allegations – removed 
Respondent from the household. Texas law holds that the purpose of temporary orders and 
injunctive relief is to maintain or restore the status quo pending trial. See In re Shifflet, 462 
S.W.3d 528, 537 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2015, orig. proceeding) (courts aim to restore 
the last peaceable status quo pending final trial). 
16. Here, the true status quo ante was the intact family unit with Respondent present.
The situation now – Respondent barred from the home and children – is a drastic deviation from 
that status quo, achieved only by contested court orders that, as shown, lack validity. Every day 
that Respondent is kept out is a day the family’s natural equilibrium is disturbed further.

14. In sum, the prior temporary orders that ousted Respondent were built on a
foundation of fraud. They should carry no weight and pose no obstacle to granting relief in this
new SAPCR. This Court not only has the authority to declare such orders void, it has a duty to
do so in order to prevent manifest injusticec. See Burnaman, 240 S.W.2d at 291. By proceeding
with a fresh SAPCR, the Court can consider the issues regarding the children de novo, on truthful
evidence, untainted by the false premises of the earlier orders. Equity regards as done that which
ought to have been done — the Court should restore Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS,
(Petitioner in the new cause) to his rightful place in the home and children’s lives, as if the

fraudulent orders had never been entered.

E. Restoring the True Status Quo of the Family

15. Relief in this SAPCR is also warranted to restore the status quo that existed before
Petitioner’s improper actions. The “last actual, peaceable status quo” in this family was
Respondent living in the home with the children, as a present and active father. That was the
reality until late 2023, when Petitioner — through unilateral false allegations — removed
Respondent from the household. Texas law holds that the purpose of temporary orders and
injunctive relief is to maintain or restore the status quo pending trial. See Jn re Shifflet, 462
S.W.3d 528, 537 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2015, orig. proceeding) (courts aim to restore

the last peaceable status quo pending final trial).

16. Here, the true status quo ante was the intact family unit with Respondent present.
The situation now — Respondent barred from the home and children — is a drastic deviation from
that status quo, achieved only by contested court orders that, as shown, lack validity. Every day

that Respondent is kept out is a day the family’s natural equilibrium is disturbed further.

Texas courts have intervened in analogous situations to return to the rightful status quo. For 
example, when one party’s unilateral conduct disrupts a long-standing living arrangement, courts 
recognize that stability must be restored for the benefit of all, especially the children. See Smith 
v. McDaniel, 842 S.W.2d 7, 12 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1992, no writ) (courts should preserve or
restore the conditions that existed prior to the controversy to protect the children’s routine and 
sense of security). Here, restoring the status quo means allowing Respondent back into his 
home and parenting role immediately. That was the “last peaceable” situation before litigation 
– a state in which the children were thriving. Notably, the findings in the temporary orders
hearing (held without Respondent) even indicate there were no findings of any imminent harm if 
Respondent were present; the exclusion was based solely on Petitioner’s requested relief, not on 
proven misconduct by Respondent.  
17. Thus, there is no safety-based reason to maintain the current deviation from the norm.
By contrast, there are powerful reasons to return to normalcy: the children’s suffering would be 
alleviated, and the family’s balance and stability would be reestablished. 
18. In short, equity demands that we “undo” the improper disruption caused by
Petitioner’s actions. This SAPCR allows the Court to do exactly that – to realign temporary 
orders with reality and justice. In re Shifflet instructs that the last peaceable status quo should 
be restored pending trial. The last peaceable status was Respondent in the home; restoring that 
will harm no one (again, even Petitioner did not claim any abuse or violence requiring exclusion 
– her application acknowledged no recent violence, only vague fears). Maintaining the current
situation, by contrast, gravely harms the children and prejudices Respondent’s relationship with 
them. Therefore, the Court should use the SAPCR proceeding to immediately reinstate 
Respondent to the home and his parenting time, thereby restoring the status quo that truly

serves the children’s welfare. Every additional day away from that status quo is a deviation that 
this Court can and should correct now. 
F. The Court’s Duty to Act Without Delay for the Children’s Welfare
19. By accepting this SAPCR as a separate case, the Court can fulfill its paramount duty
to protect the children’s welfare without procedural delay. Courts have a sacred obligation 
to put the interests of children above rigid procedural considerations, especially in emergencies. 
The Texas Supreme Court has emphasized that trial courts must act immediately when 
children’s physical or emotional well-being is at stake, even if procedural complexities exist. 
In In re Tex. Department of Family & Protective Services, for example, the Supreme Court 
admonished that delays in custody matters are intolerable, quoting with approval the maxim: 
“Justice demands a speedy resolution of child custody and child support issues.” 210 S.W.3d 
609, 613 (Tex. 2006). The high court in that case (a mandamus proceeding) required prompt 
action despite procedural entanglements, recognizing that a child’s need for a stable, safe 
environment cannot be made to wait on protracted litigation maneuvers. 
20. Similarly, in Elizondo v. Monteleone, an appellate court noted that when a parent
attempted procedural gambits to delay a custody determination, the court system should not 
allow those tactics to trump the child’s immediate needs. Elizondo v. Monteleone, 96 S.W.3d 705, 
708 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2002, no pet.) (courts will not permit jurisdictional technicalities 
to delay emergency relief in a parent-child case). [(If citation is verified)] In that case, one party 
tried to remove the case to federal court and argued that the state court lacked jurisdiction to 
issue temporary orders during the interim. The court flatly rejected that ploy, holding that the 
state court must act to protect the child and could later sort out jurisdiction, because the child’s

welfare was paramount. The lesson is clear: procedural fencing cannot override the need for 
immediate judicial action when children are suffering. 
21. Here, Petitioner’s inaction and the snares of the divorce case have already delayed
relief for far too long. The children have been without their father for several critical months of 
their development. The Court has the power—and indeed the duty—to cut through the 
procedural morass by creating a new SAPCR docket and promptly addressing the merits of 
conservatorship, possession, and access. There is no jurisdictional barrier to doing so: this Court 
has continuing jurisdiction over the children (by virtue of the ongoing divorce) and thus can hear 
a SAPCR involving them. Any concern about duplicitous litigation is mitigated by the fact that 
the divorce case is effectively moribund; furthermore, Respondent will move to consolidate or 
dismiss the divorce once the SAPCR is in place, if appropriate. What cannot be allowed is more 
delay that leaves the children in a fractured situation. Our Courts are courts of equity as well 
as law, especially in family matters. When equity demands immediate intervention, the Court 
should not hesitate. As the Austin Court of Appeals observed, “when the jurisdiction of the court 
has been properly invoked in matters affecting minor children, the court’s primary consideration 
is the best interest of the children, and the court may enter any order deemed necessary to 
protect and conserve the welfare of the child.” Elizondo, 96 S.W.3d at 708 (citing Tex. Fam. 
Code § 105.001 on temporary orders for a child). In other words, once the Court is aware of a 
child in need, it must act, and act swiftly.

immediate hearing, the Court will be performing its highest duty: safeguarding the children’s

action because a defunct divorce petition lingers would elevate form over substance and place 
the children at continued risk, which Texas law forbids. 
23. In sum, this Court is empowered and required to provide a forum for immediate
relief, and the SAPCR is the proper mechanism to do so. The Court should therefore promptly 
docket this SAPCR as a new case and schedule an emergency hearing on temporary orders for 
the children. 
G. Protective-Order Application Confirms Respondent’s Joint Ownership of the Home
24. Even Petitioner’s own filings acknowledge Respondent’s legal right to return to the
residence. In her sworn Application for Protective Order (filed in September 2023), Petitioner 
explicitly affirmed that the marital residence “is jointly owned or leased by the Applicant and 
Respondent.” 
25. This judicial admission is significant. It means that at the time she sought exclusive
use of the home, Petitioner conceded that Respondent is co-owner (or co-leaseholder) of the 
property. There is no dispute, therefore, that Respondent has an equal property interest and 
legal right to occupy the home. Petitioner cannot now contradict her own sworn statement by 
suggesting Respondent has no such right. 
26. Why is this important? Because the prior orders granting Petitioner exclusive
possession of the home (and excluding Respondent) stand in direct conflict with the parties’ 
property rights and the status quo. Those orders were based not on any finding that Respondent 
lacked ownership or rights to the home, but presumably on a temporary need for protection 
(which, as shown, was falsely claimed). With the exposure of Petitioner’s allegations as false, 
there remains no lawful basis to keep Respondent out of a home that he owns jointly. Texas

Family Code § 153.003 states that the Court cannot condition a parent’s possession of a child on 
the payment of support or other matters unrelated to the child – likewise, the Court should not 
condition Respondent’s access to his home (and thereby to his children) on a procedurally flawed 
prior order, especially when Petitioner herself admits the home is community property. The 
protective order application further underscores that Petitioner’s sole claim to the home was 
through a temporary court order, not any independent right. When the predicate for that 
temporary order (alleged family violence) is unproven and disputed, the underlying property 
rights must prevail. 
27. In equity, where two parties have equal right to possession of a property, one cannot
exclude the other absent a valid court order supported by good cause. Here, absent the now-
questionable temporary orders, Respondent as joint owner would be free to live in his home. The 
Court should thus give weight to Petitioner’s admission of joint ownership and recognize 
Respondent’s unabated property right. This is yet another reason to allow the SAPCR to go 
forward: so that the issue of residency and possession of the home can be revisited in light of the 
true facts and rights of the parties. The protective order was leveraged into a settlement which 
both parties did not agree to (as the record will show, if needed), meaning no long-term 
restrictions were found warranted. What remains is a fit father who co-owns his home seeking to 
return to his necessity to work and provide financially for the children. Petitioner’s own 
pleadings remove any doubt about his entitlement. Accordingly, the Clerk and Court should not 
hesitate to facilitate Respondent’s return via new temporary orders in this SAPCR, as even 
Petitioner’s sworn statements support Respondent’s position.

Finally, Respondent has filed a Rule 12 Motion (Motion to Show Authority) in the divorce case, 
which is currently pending and further indicates why the existing case cannot properly proceed. 
In that motion (filed September 20, 2024), Respondent challenged the authority of Petitioner’s 
attorney of record to act on her behalf.  
28. This challenge was not made lightly – it is supported by evidence that Petitioner’s
counsel never filed the pleadings, is not authorized to practice in this matter under her current 
registration, and may not even have a valid engagement with Petitioner. Notably, since that 
motion was filed, Petitioner’s counsel has failed to respond to it or otherwise prove her 
authority. Rule 12 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provides that an attorney challenged by 
such a motion must appear and show authority to act for the client, or else be struck from the 
case. Petitioner’s counsel has not met this burden. Instead, irregularities have abounded: at a 
recent hearing (on Respondent’s motion to recuse), Petitioner’s counsel appeared without 
having answered the Rule 12 motion, and the Court allowed her to argue on a motion she did 
not respond to, but her authority remains in question.. Moreover, it came to light that Petitioner’s 
counsel has been unable to e-file pleadings on her client’s behalf because her electronic filing 
account is in disarray (registered under a former employer’s email at Cantey Hanger yet is 
signing pleadings for Marx, Altman, & Johnson) . In fact, the few documents “filed” in the 
divorce case on Petitioner’s side were filed by Roderick Marx, not by the attorney herself. And 
tellingly, Petitioner’s counsel failed to file the Notice of Remand after the federal court sent the 
case back, leaving the case hanging indefinitely. All of this demonstrates that Petitioner’s counsel 
is effectively not acting with proper authority or competence in the divorce matter.

essentially unrepresented in the divorce. Her pleadings (including the Original Petition for

proceeding would be a nullity without an authorized petitioner or counsel – which is another 
reason it has stagnated. It would be unjust to make the children wait for months while this issue 
is sorted out. By contrast, in a new SAPCR, Petitioner can secure proper counsel or proceed pro

relief. The pending Rule 12 motion underscores that the divorce case is on unstable footing. It 
is procedurally snarled by questions of representation. On the other hand, Respondent is ready to 
proceed in the SAPCR immediately – he, as the petitioner in the SAPCR, obviously has 
authority to bring it, and he will serve Petitioner directly. If Petitioner’s prior counsel truly has no 
authority, Petitioner will have to either hire new counsel or represent herself in responding to the 
SAPCR, but at least the case will move forward. The Rule 12 fiasco in the divorce should not be 
allowed to delay relief for the children. Equity again favors moving to a forum (the SAPCR) 
where all parties before the Court are indisputably authorized and the merits can be reached 
without distraction.

cloud over Petitioner’s representation. This factor strongly supports accepting the SAPCR as a 
standalone action and granting the requested hearing and relief without delay. 
I. Conclusion
31. For all the foregoing reasons – lack of prosecution in the divorce, Petitioner’s waiver
of opposition, the children’s urgent needs, the void nature of prior orders, the necessity of 
restoring the status quo, and procedural snares in the divorce case – Respondent respectfully 
urges the Clerk to file the enclosed SAPCR as a new cause of action, and requests that the 
Court set an immediate EX-PARTE hearing on temporary orders in this SAPCR to issue 
injunctive relief immediately allowing access back into the residency and children’s lives. 
The Court has abundant legal justification and equitable grounds to do so. Most importantly, the 
children’s welfare compels immediate action, and the Petitioner will not be adversely 
affected by this decision, and has immediate housing options nearby available to her, 
contrary to the undersigned. Every factor discussed above converges on one truth: these 
children need their father back and need a stable, working court order to govern their custody

cloud over Petitioner’s representation. This factor strongly supports accepting the SAPCR as a

standalone action and granting the requested hearing and relief without delay.

I. Conclusion

31. For all the foregoing reasons — lack of prosecution in the divorce, Petitioner’s waiver
of opposition, the children’s urgent needs, the void nature of prior orders, the necessity of
restoring the status quo, and procedural snares in the divorce case — Respondent respectfully
urges the Clerk to file the enclosed SAPCR as a new cause of action, and requests that the
Court set an immediate EX-PARTE hearing on temporary orders in this SAPCR to issue
injunctive relief immediately allowing access back into the residency and children’s lives.
The Court has abundant legal justification and equitable grounds to do so. Most importantly, the
children’s welfare compels immediate action, and the Petitioner will not be adversely
affected by this decision, and has immediate housing options nearby available to her,
contrary to the undersigned. Every factor discussed above converges on one truth: these
children need their father back and need a stable, working court order to govern their custody
and care — and they need it now, not months from now. By allowing this SAPCR to proceed
separately, the Court will cut the Gordian knot that the divorce case has become and will be able

to issue orders truly serving the children’s best interests forthwith.

Court’s disposal to provide it. 
33. Thank you very much for your prompt attention to this urgent matter. By taking swift
action, the Clerk and Court will literally be changing the lives of two children for the better. The 
law and justice are on the side of moving forward with this SAPCR. Respondent implores the 
Court to do so without delay.
