MOTION FOR NO-EVIDENCE SUMMARY JUDGMENT

TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THE COURT:

I. Introduction

Respondent Charles Dustin Myers (hereinafter “Father’”) moves for no-evidence
summary judgment pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 166a(1) to dismiss all claims filed
by Petitioner Morgan Michelle Myers (“Mother’’). After an adequate time for discovery has
passed, Rule 166a(i) authorizes summary judgment on the ground that there is no evidence of
one or more essential elements of a claim on which the adverse party would bear the burden of
proof at trial. This rule is “essentially a pretrial directed verdict” procedure, shifting the burden
to the non-movant to produce more than a scintilla of probative evidence once a proper motion is
filed. Here, Father specifically identifies each essential element of Mother’s claims for which no

evidence exists. Because Mother has failed to produce any evidence to support those elements

despite nearly two years of litigation, the Court must grant summary judgment in Respondent’s 
favor unless Mother comes forward with competent evidence raising a genuine fact issue. 
 
In this case, more than 22 months have elapsed since Mother initiated the divorce, and 
she has produced nothing to substantiate her serious allegations of family violence, the existence 
of a protective order, financial indigence, or the supposed benefit of onerous temporary orders to 
the children. She also ignored written discovery requests, allowing requests for admission to be 
deemed admitted by operation of law. Texas law does not permit a claimant to continue a lawsuit 
in the absence of evidence. Indeed, courts have not hesitated to dispose of divorce-related claims 
by summary judgment where a spouse lacks evidence on an essential fact – for example, an 
alleged informal marriage was summarily dismissed when one party was underage and “there 
was no evidence” of the required parental or court consent. Likewise, Mother’s claims here 
should be conclusively resolved now. After such a prolonged and unsupported litigation and two 
years of substantial damages, Respondent is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Father incorporates by reference the chronology of events in this case leading up to May

opposing party.  See Third Amended Consolidated Mandamus Record – p.6-36; See also Second 
Amended Consolidated Mandamus Record. Both of these documents have been duly served on 
the opposing party, who continues to remain silent on the issues within this matter. No factual

III. Legal Standards 
A. No-Evidence Summary Judgment Under Rule 166a(i) 
2. 
Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 166a(i), after an adequate time for discovery, a 
party may move for summary judgment on the ground that there is “no evidence” of one or 
more essential elements of a claim or defense on which the non-movant would bear the burden of 
proof at trial. The rule was added in 1997 to provide a mechanism analogous to a directed verdict 
before trial, allowing courts to dispose of baseless claims or defenses at the summary judgment 
stage. The movant is not required to present evidence in support of a no-evidence motion; rather, 
the motion itself can be based solely on the absence of evidence in the record. 
3. 
A proper no-evidence motion must state the specific elements as to which there is no 
evidence, and it must not be conclusory or overly general. The purpose of this specificity 
requirement is to give fair notice to the non-movant of exactly what must be rebutted. Once such 
a motion is filed, the burden shifts to the non-moving party (here, Petitioner) to produce 
evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact on each challenged element. The non-movant 
must come forward with more than a scintilla of evidence – i.e., evidence that rises above mere 
speculation and would enable reasonable jurors to differ. If the non-movant fails to meet this 
burden, the court “must” grant the motion. 
4. 
Importantly, Rule 166a(i) requires that an adequate time for discovery has elapsed 
before a no-evidence motion is heard. The rule does not mandate that discovery be entirely 
completed – only that the parties have had a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery on the 
issues. All cases in Texas are governed by one of the discovery control plans in Rule 190. In a 
Level 2 family law case (the category this divorce falls under), there is a presumptive discovery

period that ends 30 days before trial. In other words, by a month before the trial date, the parties 
are expected to have had adequate time to gather evidence. Here, this case has been pending for 
almost two years without trial, and Petitioner has neither responded to discovery nor sought 
additional time. Courts have held that even if the formal discovery period has not expired, a 
movant can show an adequate time has passed by demonstrating that further discovery would be 
futile or that the non-movant had ample opportunity but failed to act. If a non-movant believes 
more discovery is needed, the proper course is to file a verified motion for continuance 
explaining the necessity. Petitioner here filed no such motion or affidavit. Accordingly, the 
“adequate time” requirement is satisfied by the lengthy pendency of the case and Petitioner’s 
inaction. 
B. Equitable Defense of Laches in Divorce Cases 
5. 
Laches is an equitable defense that prevents a party from asserting a claim after an 
unreasonable delay that has caused prejudice to the opposing party. The two essential elements of 
laches are: (1) an unreasonable delay by one having a legal or equitable right in asserting it, and 
(2) a good faith change of position by another to their detriment because of the delay. In Texas, 
courts have observed that “[a]s a general rule, laches will not bar a plaintiff’s suit before the 
statute of limitations has run absent extraordinary circumstances that would work a grave 
injustice.” See Fox v. O’Leary, No. 03-11-00270-CV, 2012 WL 2979053, at *3 (Tex. App.—
Austin July 10, 2012, pet. denied) (mem. op.) (quoting Caldwell v. Barnes, 975 S.W.2d 535, 538 
(Tex. 1989)). 
6. 
 In other words, if a claim is brought within the limitations period, laches typically does 
not apply unless the delay was extraordinarily prejudicial. However, where no fixed limitations 
period governs (as in certain divorce-related proceedings), or where the delay extends well

inaction.

B. Equitable Defense of Laches in Divorce Cases

5. Laches is an equitable defense that prevents a party from asserting a claim after an
unreasonable delay that has caused prejudice to the opposing party. The two essential elements of
laches are: (1) an unreasonable delay by one having a legal or equitable right in asserting it, and
(2) a good faith change of position by another to their detriment because of the delay. In Texas,
courts have observed that “/a/s a general rule, laches will not bar a plaintiff's suit before the
statute of limitations has run absent extraordinary circumstances that would work a grave
injustice.” See Fox v. O’Leary, No. 03-11-00270-CV, 2012 WL 2979053, at *3 (Tex. App.—
Austin July 10, 2012, pet. denied) (mem. op.) (quoting Caldwell v. Barnes, 975 S.W.2d 535, 538

(Tex. 1989)).

beyond what is reasonable, laches can be invoked to protect the opposing party from inequity. 
The Texas Family Code explicitly acknowledges that equitable defenses like laches and estoppel 
are available to bar enforcement of certain family law agreements or judgments. See Tex. Fam. 
Code § 4.008. 
7. 
In the present case, Mother effectively slept on her rights for nearly two years after 
obtaining temporary orders. She initiated claims of abuse and other misconduct but then failed to 
prosecute those claims or produce evidence, allowing the case to stagnate. During that time, 
Father drastically changed his position in reliance on the expectation that Mother had abandoned 
her allegations – he incurred debt, lost employment opportunities, and scrambled to maintain 
stability for the children, all while Mother remained silent as Father appealed and exhausted 
every available remedy for redress. Equity aids the vigilant, not those who slumber on their 
rights. Mother’s extreme delay in pursuing any final resolution is unreasonable, and it has caused 
real prejudice to Father and the children’s well-being. Should Mother attempt at the last minute 
to introduce new claims or evidence that were available long ago, the Court should find such 
maneuver barred by laches. In the context of divorce litigation, Texas courts have applied laches 
to prevent unfair surprise or prejudice – for example, a party who waited many years to enforce a 
divorce decree faced a laches defense, and the courts noted that unless “extraordinary 
circumstances” exist, laches will not save a dilatory party acting within limitations. Here, 
Mother’s delay is coupled with extraordinary circumstances: Father has been forced to undertake 
multiple legal battles and the children have endured prolonged instability, all due to Mother’s 
inaction. Therefore, even if Mother were now to scramble and produce some evidence, the Court 
should exercise its equitable power to deny relief on grounds of laches. (Notably, Mother has not 
even attempted to bring forth evidence to this day, so the laches discussion is somewhat

Respondent raises laches in an abundance of caution to foreclose any eleventh-hour revival of 
stale claims.) 
IV. No-Evidence Grounds for Summary Judgment 
8. 
Respondent challenges the following essential elements of Petitioner’s claims, for 
which there is no evidence: 
i. Family Violence During the Marriage – Petitioner cannot produce evidence that family 
violence occurred at any time during the marriage. There are no police reports, medical 
records, credible witness testimony, or other admissible evidence to substantiate any act 
or threat of “family violence” as defined by Texas law. Petitioner’s own conduct – 
including her continued cohabitation with Father after the alleged incidents and her 
withdrawal of the protective order application – contradicts her allegations. Without 
evidence meeting the statutory definition, Petitioner cannot satisfy this essential element 
(see Tex. Fam. Code § 71.004, defining “family violence” as an act intended to result in 
physical harm, bodily injury, assault, or a threat that reasonably places the family member 
in fear of imminent harm). 
ii. Existence of an Active Protective Order with a Finding of Family Violence – 
Petitioner cannot produce evidence that any active protective order with a finding of 
family violence existed during the marriage. No court ever issued such an order, and 
Petitioner’s only application was withdrawn before any hearing. There is no signed order 
or judgment in the record titled “Protective Order” as required by law, and no judicial 
finding of family violence was ever made. Texas law requires a hearing and family-

IV. No-Evidence Grounds for Summary Judgment

Respondent challenges the following essential elements of Petitioner’s claims, for

which there is no evidence:

il.

Family Violence During the Marriage — Petitioner cannot produce evidence that family
violence occurred at any time during the marriage. There are no police reports, medical
records, credible witness testimony, or other admissible evidence to substantiate any act
or threat of “family violence” as defined by Texas law. Petitioner’s own conduct —
including her continued cohabitation with Father after the alleged incidents and her
withdrawal of the protective order application — contradicts her allegations. Without
evidence meeting the statutory definition, Petitioner cannot satisfy this essential element
(see Tex. Fam. Code § 71.004, defining “family violence” as an act intended to result in
physical harm, bodily injury, assault, or a threat that reasonably places the family member

in fear of imminent harm).

Existence of an Active Protective Order with a Finding of Family Violence —
Petitioner cannot produce evidence that any active protective order with a finding of
family violence existed during the marriage. No court ever issued such an order, and
Petitioner’s only application was withdrawn before any hearing. There is no signed order
or judgment in the record titled “Protective Order” as required by law, and no judicial

finding of family violence was ever made. Texas law requires a hearing and family-

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---

violence finding for a protective order to issue (Tex. Fam. Code §§ 85.001, 81.001). 
Without a court’s finding and a resulting order, this alleged element fails as a matter of 
law. (See also Tex. Fam. Code § 85.004, requiring a protective order to be a separate 
document.) 
iii. Petitioner’s Alleged Indigence on December 18, 2023 – Petitioner cannot produce 
evidence that she was financially indigent on the date she filed suit (Dec. 18, 2023) under 
oath. Her sworn affidavit of inability to pay costs is conclusively refuted by objective 
facts – e.g., her withdrawal of $1,576 in marital funds just days earlier (Dec. 15, 2023) 
which she failed to disclose. There are no bank statements or other financial records 
supporting her claim that she only had $21 to her name on that date. To the contrary, the 
evidence shows she had access to and actually took substantial funds. Without any 
evidence to substantiate true indigence, this element cannot be established, making this 
case ripe for dismissal under the Texas Practice and Remedies Code. 
iv. Notice and Hearing on Temporary Orders (February 1, 2024) – Petitioner cannot 
produce evidence that a proper hearing occurred on her Motion for Temporary Orders 
and Injunction on February 1, 2024, or that this motion was ever properly served on 
Respondent. There is no transcript, no court reporter’s record, no signed waiver, and not 
even a file-marked copy of any such motion served on Respondent in advance containing 
a certificate of service. Absent proof that Respondent received due notice of a temporary 
orders hearing and that an actual evidentiary hearing was held, any Temporary Orders 
resulting from that date lack a lawful foundation. In short, there is no evidence that the 
procedural prerequisites (notice, hearing, opportunity to be heard) for temporary

violence finding for a protective order to issue (Tex. Fam. Code §§ 85.001, 81.001).
Without a court’s finding and a resulting order, this alleged element fails as a matter of
law. (See also Tex. Fam. Code § 85.004, requiring a protective order to be a separate

document.)

Petitioner’s Alleged Indigence on December 18, 2023 — Petitioner cannot produce
evidence that she was financially indigent on the date she filed suit (Dec. 18, 2023) under
oath. Her sworn affidavit of inability to pay costs is conclusively refuted by objective
facts — e.g., her withdrawal of $1,576 in marital funds just days earlier (Dec. 15, 2023)
which she failed to disclose. There are no bank statements or other financial records
supporting her claim that she only had $21 to her name on that date. To the contrary, the
evidence shows she had access to and actually took substantial funds. Without any
evidence to substantiate true indigence, this element cannot be established, making this

case ripe for dismissal under the Texas Practice and Remedies Code.

produce evidence that a proper hearing occurred on her Motion for Temporary Orders
and Injunction on February 1, 2024, or that this motion was ever properly served on
Respondent. There is no transcript, no court reporter’s record, no signed waiver, and not
even a file-marked copy of any such motion served on Respondent in advance containing
a certificate of service. Absent proof that Respondent received due notice of a temporary
orders hearing and that an actual evidentiary hearing was held, any Temporary Orders
resulting from that date lack a lawful foundation. In short, there is no evidence that the

procedural prerequisites (notice, hearing, opportunity to be heard) for temporary

injunctive relief were satisfied, so any claim by Petitioner premised on the validity of 
those February 1 proceedings is unsupported. 
v. Respondent’s Agreement to the March 14, 2024 “Agreed” Orders – Petitioner cannot 
produce evidence that Respondent ever agreed to the terms of the March 14, 2024, 
Temporary Orders. There is no signed agreement by Respondent, no written consent, no 
email, no testimony – nothing – indicating that Respondent approved those terms. In fact, 
all evidence is to the contrary: the orders were drafted exclusively by Petitioner’s counsel 
and imposed unilaterally by the court over Respondent’s objection. The signature line for 
Respondent is blank (since he refused to sign), and there is sworn testimony from 
Respondent that he objected at every opportunity. Thus, Petitioner cannot show the 
Temporary Orders were truly “agreed” – an essential underpinning of their legitimacy. 
Without evidence of a meeting of the minds or consent, any contention that Respondent 
agreed to those orders fails, as evidenced by his lack of signature. 
vi. Temporary Orders Are in the Best Interests of the Children – Petitioner cannot 
produce evidence that the current Temporary Orders (which grant Mother exclusive 
occupancy of the home and curtail Father’s rights) are in the best interest of the 
children. Under Texas law, the best interest of the child is the paramount consideration in 
determining conservatorship or possession (Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002). Petitioner has 
offered no expert testimony, no child therapist statements, no school records, no medical 
records, nor any factual evidence at all demonstrating that these Temporary Orders 
(which severely limit Father’s access and removed the children from their father and 
home) benefit the children. To the contrary, Petitioner ignored a court-ordered parenting 
course designed to benefit the children, which undercuts any claim that the current orders

issue.

Each of the above elements is one on which Petitioner bears the burden of proof at trial. 
After nearly two years, she has adduced nothing – no documents, no affidavits, no testimony – 
that could prove any of these points. By contrast, Father has actively sought to uncover the truth 
and provide evidence, but in a no-evidence motion the movant’s evidence need not be 
considered. Still, for completeness, Father summarizes below some of the evidence that further 
negates Petitioner’s claims. 
V. Respondent’s Affirmative Evidence (For Context) 
9. 
While not required to prevail on a no-evidence motion, Respondent notes that ample 
evidence in the record affirmatively disproves Petitioner’s allegations, including but not limited 
to: 
i. 
Financial Responsibility: Father was the financially responsible spouse throughout the 
marriage, as shown by bank records, pay stubs, and tax returns. He paid the bills, 
managed investments, and ensured both car payments were made – directly contradicting 
Petitioner’s claim of her own indigence or that Father left her without support. 
ii. No History of Violence: Father has no criminal or family-violence history. A Texas 
Department of Public Safety background check and sworn affidavits from acquaintances 
confirm he has never been reported or charged with any act of family violence. This clean 
record undermines Petitioner’s assertions that Father suddenly became abusive.

While not required to prevail on a no-evidence motion, Respondent notes that ample

evidence in the record affirmatively disproves Petitioner’s allegations, including but not limited

to:

Financial Responsibility: Father was the financially responsible spouse throughout the
marriage, as shown by bank records, pay stubs, and tax returns. He paid the bills,
managed investments, and ensured both car payments were made — directly contradicting

Petitioner’s claim of her own indigence or that Father left her without support.

No History of Violence: Father has no criminal or family-violence history. A Texas
Department of Public Safety background check and sworn affidavits from acquaintances
confirm he has never been reported or charged with any act of family violence. This clean

record undermines Petitioner’s assertions that Father suddenly became abusive.

iii. Use of Home for Work: Father’s livelihood depended on the marital residence 
(specifically, its home office and internet access) for his business operations and remote 
work. The Temporary Orders removing him inflicted immediate financial harm – which 
was precisely what Petitioner sought in order to gain leverage. This evidence reinforces 
that the orders were punitive, not child-centered. 
iv. Mother’s Misconduct: Petitioner unilaterally disposed of many of Father’s personal 
belongings after obtaining exclusive use of the house (e.g. throwing items onto the curb 
or selling them). She also interfered with Father’s possession of the children (as 
evidenced by text messages and emails), further indicating that her actions were 
motivated by malice rather than any genuine fear. 
v. False Statements: There is documented proof of numerous false statements made by 
Petitioner under oath (for example, claiming an active protective order existed when it 
did not, claiming poverty while hiding funds, etc.). These falsehoods, now proven, erode 
any credibility Petitioner might try to invoke if she belatedly offers self-serving 
testimony. 
10. 
In sum, not only is Petitioner’s case devoid of supporting evidence, but the evidence that 
does exist in the record affirmatively supports Father’s position that Petitioner’s claims are 
unfounded. Nevertheless, because Rule 166a(i) places no burden on Respondent to produce 
evidence at this stage, the above points are provided merely for context and to illustrate the 
futility of any further proceedings on Petitioner’s claims.

that the orders were punitive, not child-centered.

any credibility Petitioner might try to invoke if she belatedly offers self-serving

testimony.

In sum, not only is Petitioner’s case devoid of supporting evidence, but the evidence that

does exist in the record affirmatively supports Father’s position that Petitioner’s claims are

unfounded. Nevertheless, because Rule 166a(1) places no burden on Respondent to produce

evidence at this stage, the above points are provided merely for context and to illustrate the

futility of any further proceedings on Petitioner’s claims.

VI. Adequate Time for Discovery

11. 
This Motion is filed after an adequate time for discovery has passed, as required by 
Rule 166a(i). The divorce has been pending since December 2023 (nearly 23 months as of this 
filing). Petitioner had every opportunity to conduct discovery, compel information, or otherwise 
develop evidence to support her claims. Respondent, for his part, served discovery requests on 
Petitioner (interrogatories, requests for production, requests for admissions) in September 2024 – 
to which Petitioner never responded, thereby resulting in deemed admissions. Under the Level 2 
discovery control plan applicable to this case, an adequate time for discovery is presumptively 
30 days before trial. Although a final trial setting was only recently contemplated, and not even 
by the Petitioner but the Court itself, the reality is that Petitioner effectively ceased litigating this 
case for almost two years. By any measure, the parties have had more than an adequate 
opportunity to investigate the claims. Petitioner cannot credibly claim she needs more time – if 
she believed as much, her remedy was to file a motion for continuance with an affidavit 
explaining what additional discovery was needed. She filed no such motion. Accordingly, the 
Court can confidently conclude that the “adequate time for discovery” requirement is met. In 
fact, further delay would reward the very indifference that necessitated this motion in the first 
place. 
VII. Legal Standard for Granting No-Evidence Summary Judgment 
12. 
Under Rule 166a(i) and the applicable case law, a no-evidence summary judgment must 
be granted unless the non-movant produces more than a scintilla of evidence raising a genuine 
issue of material fact on each challenged element. In other words, if the evidence is so weak that 
it creates merely a surmise or suspicion of a fact, it is legally insufficient to defeat the motion. 
See Cole v. Cole, No. 03-24-00275-CV (Tex. App.–Austin Aug. 28, 2025) (mem. op.) (more than 
a scintilla is required); In re G.D.P., No. 02-23-00001-CV, 2023 WL 5620089 (Tex. App.–Fort

Worth Aug. 1, 2023, no pet.) (mem. op.) (same standard). Evidence that is so slight or so 
thoroughly discredited that reasonable jurors could not infer the existence of the disputed fact is 
considered “no evidence” in legal contemplation. See Wilkerson v. Wilkerson, 321 S.W.3d 110, 
117 (Tex. App.–Houston [1st Dist.] 2010, pet. denied) (evidence that amounts to nothing more 
than suspicion is legally insufficient). 
13. 
Here, as detailed above, Petitioner has come forward with zero evidence on multiple 
essential elements of her case. By contrast, Respondent has highlighted the complete lack of 
proof and, indeed, the record reveals admissions and uncontested facts that negate Petitioner’s 
claims. Because Petitioner cannot point to more than a scintilla of competent evidence in support 
of the challenged elements, the Court must grant summary judgment as a matter of law. 
 
 
 
VII. Conclusion 
14. 
There is no need for a trial on the merits in this case, as the Petitioner has no merit to her 
claims and has abused and intentionally misrepresented fact to the Court. She has intentionally 
disrupted the lives of her own children, intentionally displaced the Father from his home and 
chose to pursue an extramarital affair over finalizing the divorce, and has caused significant 
financial harm to the marital estate. 
15. 
Because the Petitioner has failed to produce any evidence for her claims, has obtained a

because Petitioner brought this suit in bad faith, this no-evidence motion for summary judgment 
should be granted as a matter of law, and a subsequent hearing regarding Father’s contempt 
motion should be held at the earliest opportunity to ensure Petitioner is held accountable for her 
egregious actions, and that her alleged attorney, Cooper L. Carter, is referred to the appropriate 
disciplinary authorities to prevent similar conduct from occurring in the future. 
VIII. Prayer
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Respondent Charles Dustin Myers 
respectfully prays that this Court: 
1. Grant this No-Evidence Motion for Summary Judgment in its entirety upon
written submission, deny all relief requested by Petitioner, and dismiss all of
Petitioner’s claims with prejudice for want of any supporting evidence. In the
alternative,  Respondent prays that the Court hold that Petitioner’s claims are
equitably barred by laches due to her unreasonable delay and the resulting prejudice;
2. If the Petitioner is unable to prove her initial claims of financial indigency, dismiss
this suit pursuant to Tex. Prac. Rem. Code § 13.001;
3. Vacate the December 10, 2025, trial setting;
4. Respondent further prays for such other and further relief, at law or in equity, to
which he may show himself justly entitled.
Respectfully submitted,
