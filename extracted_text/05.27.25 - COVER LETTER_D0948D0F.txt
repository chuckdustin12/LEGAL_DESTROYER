SUBJECT: MANDAMUS #5

TO: THE HONORABLE CLERK OF THE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS

COVER LETTER

TO THE HONORABLE CLERK OF THE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS:

The undersigned, Charles Dustin Myers, respectfully submits this cover
letter alongside the Petition for Writ of Mandamus enclosed in this envelope, and
for the forthcoming reasons, request that it be docketed as an original proceeding.
He understands that the filing was rejected, but wanted to respectfully reiterate

why it was first presented before this Court.

SUMMARY

The Supreme Court of Texas will accept a mandamus petition directly,
without first requiring relief from the court of appeals, in five primary
circumstances: when compelling a state officer to perform duties (except against
the governor), when necessary to enforce its jurisdiction, when involving
extraordinary importance to state jurisprudence, when a court of appeals commits a
clear abuse of discretion, or when there is manifest and urgent necessity with no

adequate appellate remedy Here, three of five primary circumstances are met.

APPLICABLE PRIMARY CIRCUMSTANCES  
First, this matter and the concurrent related matters involve extraordinary 
importance to the State’s jurisprudence. Concurrently before this Court are four 
related Mandamus petitions. The issues presented involve a common thread of due 
process. The interdependent issues involve the issuance of invalid orders in excess 
of statutory authority (25-0361), the refusal to perform a ministerial act (25-0367), 
the improper consolidation of a contested motion in violation of local rules (25-
0378), the refusal to comply with Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 
(25-0426), and the erroneous summary denial of two recusal motions, one of which 
was never filed. (current) These issues reveal a pattern of error that directly 
implicates the integrity of the Texas Judicial System spanning across multiple areas 
of law, including the recusal process.  
Second, the mandamus attached to this envelope is necessary to be first 
presented to this Court to enforce its jurisdiction. This authority stems directly 
from the Texas Constitution, which empowers the Supreme Court to "issue the 
writs of mandamus, procedendo, certiorari and such other writs, as may be 
necessary to enforce its jurisdiction." Tex. Const. art. 5 § 3. Mandamus petition 25-
0426 was directly submitted to this court on May 19, 2025, and the instant Petition 
is directly related and if the current petition is not properly considered in 
conjunction with it, the risk of mootness remains high.

Third, the matters before this Court will remain a manifest and urgent 
necessity with no adequate appellate remedy as clearly indicated by the 
compounding errors in both administrative proceedings and trial court proceedings. 
An emergency stay will provide for the best temporary solution, as it will resolve 
the core issues, prompt a response if any of the Respondent judges below have 
issue with the stay, or prompt a response from the opposing party who has 
remained silent on all the issues. 
As established in In re State, 355 S.W.3d 611 , the Texas Supreme Court 
may exercise its mandamus jurisdiction to prevent "enormous waste of judicial and 
public resources" and to ensure consistent and efficient adjudication of related 
matters. Here, that is precisely what is occurring. The Relator’s property interests 
and the liberty interests to his children have been divested from him without the 
proper procedural protections, and the time wasted to first file with the Second 
Court of Appeals to inevitably receive additional per curiam denials in addition to 
the nine they have already issued would be inefficient. 
Finally, by first presenting this Mandamus to the Second Court of Appeals, 
the risk of further error remains high in the trial court, and the substantial right to a 
fair and impartial tribunal could be permanently lost if not adjudicated with the 
other pending matters before this Court.

CONCLUSION 
 
The four, potentially five petitions before this Honorable Court are not mere 
disagreements with rulings, or emotional appeals. They are interrelated issues that 
highlight a systemic failure to uphold Texas procedural requirements. Each petition 
highlights an independent error that was made in the broader context of cause 
number 322-744263-23. The urgency of a stay cannot be overstated to prevent 
future error. 
 
This cover letter is not an attempt to undermine this Court’s authority. If the 
Court believes that the Relator should first present this matter to the Second Court 
of Appeals despite the four related petitions already before this Court, he will do 
so. This cover letter was an attempt to clarify the issues, and an attempt to explain 
to the Court the significance of these matters. 
 
If any further information is needed, please don’t refrain from reaching out

Respectfully submitted,
