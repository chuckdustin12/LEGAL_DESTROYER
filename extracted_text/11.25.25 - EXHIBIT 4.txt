I subscribed for an extensive education program under Charles Myers to gain expertise in
reading and researching market data. Charles Myers, a dedicated father, teacher, and
mentor, has been instrumental in inspiring myself and numerous others to independently
pursue knowledge in the field of financial data. The instability in Charles Myers’ living

situation has adversely affected his ability to fulfill his work commitments to the best of
his capacity. This instability has had a significant impact on my ability to efficiently learn
and absorb the subject matter, as Charles Myers is unable to work full time from his
home office. Charles Myers requires a meticulously crafted computer setup to efficiently
manage and process extensive data sets and resource-intensive programs essential for his

work in market research and education. The consequence of Charles Myers' restricted

personal capabilities and the quality of his products has been the comerstone of his reputation.
The denial of Mr. Myers's access to his home has not only caused significant service

However, since December 2023, there has been a notable decline in the
reliability and efficiency of the service provided. This shift coincides with Mr.
Myers facing significant personal and legal challenges, including a divorce
proceeding that has drastically impacted his ability to operate his business

effectively. A particularly distressing development for Mr. Myers has been his

inability to access the physical location where his business equipment and

data connections are housed. This situation has not only disrupted the service
but has also imposed significant financial difficulties on Mr. Myers, threatening

the sustainability of the business and the quality of service that customers
have come to expect.

The repercussions of these challenges have been felt deeply by both Mr.
Myers and his clientele. While the community understands and sympathizes
with Mr. Myers’ personal struggles, the increasing service disruptions have
raised concerns among users about the future reliability and viability of the
service. We are hopeful for a resolution that will allow Mr. Myers to regain

access to his business infrastructure, thereby restoring the service quality and
reliability that we have valued highly. It is in the interest of both Mr. Myers and

his customers to find a solution that addresses these operational challenges

while supporting him through his personal difficulties, ensuring the long-term

success and sustainability of the service.

private or public organization, other than medical assistance under chapter 32 of the Texas
Human Resources Code.

"Reasonable cost" means the total cost of health insurance coverage for all children for
which MORGAN MYERS is responsible under a medical support order that does not exceed 9
percent of MORGAN MYERS's annual resources, as described by section 154.062(b) of the
Texas Family Code.

"Health-care expenses" include, without limitation, medical, surgical, prescription drug,
mental health-care services, dental, eye care, ophthalmological, and orthodontic charges but do
not include expenses for travel to and from the provider or for nonprescription medication.

"Health-care expenses that are not reimbursed by insurance” ("unreimbursed expenses")
include related copayments and deductibles.

3. Findings on Availability of Health Insurance - Having considered the cost,
accessibility, and quality of health insurance coverage available to the parties, the Court finds:

IT IS FURTHER FOUND that the following orders regarding health-care coverage are in

the best interest of the children.

=== PAGE 46 ===
--- OCR TEXT ---
4, Provision of Health-Care Coverage —

As Petitioner’s child support, MORGAN MYERS is ORDERED to obtain Medicaid for

the children the subject of this suit, and then maintain health insurance for the children as long as

child support is payable for that child. MORGAN MYERS is ORDERED -

a. to provide to each conservator of the children the following information no later

than the thirtieth day after she received Medicaid for the children:

a. MORGA MYERS’ Social Security number;

b. Proof that health insurance has been provided for the children;

c. The following information and documents:

i;
ii.
iii.
iv.
Vv.
vi.

Vil.

The name of the health insurance carrier;
The number of the policy;

A copy of the policy;

A schedule of benefits;

A health insurance membership card;
Claim forms; and

Any other information necessary to submit a claim; and

d. To provide each conservator of the children with a copy of any

renewals or changes to the health insurance coverage of the children

and any additional information regarding health insurance coverage

of the children no later than the fifteenth day after MORGAN

MYERS receives or is provided with the renewal, change, or

additional information;

e. To notify each conservator of the children of any termination or

=== PAGE 47 ===
--- OCR TEXT ---
lapse of health insurance coverage of the children no later than the
fifteenth day after the date of the termination or lapse;

f. After termination or lapse of health insurance coverage, to notify
each conservator of the children of the availability to MORGAN
MYERS of additional health insurance for the children no later than
the fifteenth day after the date the insurance becomes available;

g. After termination or lapse of health insurance coverage, to enroll the
children in a health insurance plan that is available to MORGAN
MYERS at a reasonable cost at the next available enrollment period.

Pursuant to section 1504.051 of the Texas Insurance Code, IT IS ORDERED that if
MORGAN MYERS is eligible for dependent health coverage but fails to apply to obtain
coverage for the children, the insurer shall enroll the children on application of CHARLES
MYERS or others authorized by law.

5. Allocation of Unreimbursed Expenses -

The conservator who incurs a health-care expense on behalf of a child is ORDERED to
provide to the other conservator receipts, bills, statements, or explanations of benefits showing
the uninsured portion of the health-care expenses within thirty days after the incurring
conservator receives them. The nonincurring conservator is ORDERED to pay the non-incurring
conservators percentage of the unreimbursed portion of the health-care expenses either by
paying the health-care provider directly or by reimbursing the incurring conservator for any
advance payment exceeding the incurring conservator's percentage of the unreimbursed portion
of the health-care expenses within thirty days after the nonincurring conservator receives

receipts, bills, statements, or explanations of benefits showing the unreimbursed portion of the

=== PAGE 48 ===
--- OCR TEXT ---
health-care expense.

For the Court to hold the nonincurring conservator in civil or criminal contempt for
failing to pay the nonincurring conservator's percentage of the unreimbursed portion of a health-
care expense, the incurring conservator must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
nonincurring conservator personally received receipts, bills, statements, or explanations of
benefits reflecting the unreimbursed portion of the health-care expense no later than thirty days
after the incurring conservator received them. Even if the incurring conservator fails to meet that
burden of proof, the Court may award the incurring conservator a judgment in the nature of child
support against the nonincurring conservator in the amount of the unreimbursed portion of the
heath-care expense the nonincurring conservator was ordered but fail to pay.

6. WARNING - A PARENT ORDERED TO PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE
OR DENTAL INSURANCE OR TO PAY THE OTHER PARENT ADDITIONAL CHILD
SUPPORT FOR THE COST OF HEALTH INSURANCE OR DENTAL INSURANCE WHO
FAILS TO DO SO IS LIABLE FOR NECESSARY MEDICAL EXPENSES OF THE
CHILDREN, WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER THE EXPENSES WOULD HAVE BEEN
PAID IF HEALTH INSURANCE OR DENTAL INSURANCE HAD BEEN PROVIDED, AND
FOR THE COST OF HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS, DENTAL INSURANCE
PREMIUMS, OR CONTRIBUTIONS, IF ANY, PAID ON BEHALF OF THE CHILDREN.

7. Notice to Employer - On this date a Medical Support Notice was signed by the
Court. For the purpose of section 1169 of title 29 of the United States Code, the conservator not
carrying the health or dental insurance policy is designated the custodial parent and alternate

recipient's representative.

TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR DIVORCE
1. Discovery

Discovery in this case is intended to be conducted under level 2 of rule 190 of the Texas
Rules of Civil Procedure.

Preservation of Evidence: Respondent is put on notice to preserve and not destroy,
conceal, or alter any evidence or potential evidence relevant to the issues in this case, including
tangible documents or items in Respondent's possession or subject to Respondent's control and
electronic documents, files, or other data generated by or stored on Respondent's home
computer, work computer, storage media, portable systems, electronic devices, online
repositories, or cell phone.

2. Parties

This suit is brought by MORGAN MYERS, Petitioner. The last three numbers of
MORGAN MYERS's Social Security number are 893.

CHARLES MYERS is Respondent.

a Domicile

Petitioner has been a domiciliary of Texas for the preceding six-month period and a

=== PAGE 66 ===
--- OCR TEXT ---
resident of this county for the preceding ninety-day period.
4. Service

No service on Respondent is necessary at this time.
h 3 Protective Order Statement

No protective order under title 4 of the Texas Family Code, protective order under
subchapter A of chapter 7B of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, or order for emergency
protection under Article 17.292 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure is in effect in regard to
a party to this suit or a child of a party to this suit and no application for any such order is
pending.
6. Birth Certificates

Certified copies of the children's birth certificates are not available to Petitioner.
7. Dates of Marriage and Separation

The parties were married on or about JUNE 20, 2015 and ceased to live together as
spouses on or about JANUARY 16, 2024.
8. Grounds for Divorce

The marriage has become insupportable because of discord or conflict of personalities
between Petitioner and Respondent that destroys the legitimate ends of the marriage relationship
and prevents any reasonable expectation of reconciliation.
9. Children of the Marriage

Petitioner and Respondent are parents of the following children of this marriage who are
not under the continuing jurisdiction of any other court:
Name: MARA MYERS

Sex: FEMALE

=== PAGE 67 ===
--- OCR TEXT ---
Birth date: 06/20/2016
Name: CAROLINE MYERS
Sex: FEMALE
Birth date: 04/12/2018

There are no court-ordered conservatorships, court-ordered guardianships, or other court-
ordered relationships affecting the children the subject of this suit.

Information required by section 154.181(b) and section 154.1815 of the Texas Family
Code will be provided at a later date.

No property of consequence is owned or possessed by the children the subject of this suit.

The appointment of Petitioner and Respondent as joint managing conservators would not
be in the best interest of the children. Petitioner, on final hearing, should be appointed sole
managing conservator, with all the rights and duties of a parent sole managing conservator, and
Respondent should be ordered to provide support for the children, including the payment of child
support and medical and dental support in the manner specified by the Court. Petitioner requests
that the payments for the support of the children survive the death of Respondent and become the
obligation of Respondent's estate. There should be no restriction on the geographic area within
which Petitioner may designate the primary residence of the children. Alternatively, if the
primary residence of the children is restricted to a geographic area, that area should include
Tarrant County, Texas and counties contiguous to Tarrant County, Texas.

Preceding the filing of this suit, Respondent has engaged in a history or pattern of family
violence, as defined by section 71.004 of the Texas Family Code.

Preceding the filing of this suit, Respondent has engaged in a history or pattern of child

abuse and child neglect.

=== PAGE 68 ===
--- OCR TEXT ---
Petitioner requests that the Court consider this conduct in appointing Petitioner as sole
managing conservator or the parties as joint managing conservators.

Petitioner requests the Court to order reasonable periods of electronic communication
between the children and Petitioner to supplement Petitioner's periods of possession of and
access to the children.

Respondent has a history or pattern of committing family violence during the two-year
period preceding the date of filing of this suit. Petitioner requests the Court to deny Respondent
access to the children. Alternatively, if the Court finds that awarding Respondent access to the
children would not endanger the children's physical health or emotional welfare and would be in
the best interest of the children, Petitioner requests that the Court render a possession order that
is designed to protect the safety and well-being of the children and any other person who has
been a victim of family violence committed by Respondent, including but not limited to ordering
that the periods of access be continuously supervised by an entity or person chosen by the Court,
ordering that the exchange of possession of or access to the children occur in a protective setting,
ordering Respondent to refrain from the consumption of alcohol or a controlled substance within
the twelve hours before or during each of Respondent's periods of possession of or access to the
children, and ordering Respondent to attend and complete a battering intervention and prevention
program or, if such a program is not available, to complete a course of treatment with a mental
health professional in accordance with section 153.010 of the Texas Family Code.

There is a history or pattern of child abuse, child neglect, and family violence committed
by Respondent. Petitioner requests the Court to deny Respondent access to the children.
Alternatively, Petitioner requests that the Court render a possession order that provides that

Respondent's periods of visitation be continuously supervised by an entity or person chosen by

=== PAGE 69 ===
--- OCR TEXT ---
the Court.

Petitioner also requests that the child support owed by Respondent be confirmed at final
trial.
10. Division of Community Property

Petitioner believes Petitioner and Respondent will enter into an agreement for the
division of their estate. If such an agreement is made, Petitioner requests the Court to approve
the agreement and divide their estate in a manner consistent with the agreement. If such an
agreement is not made, Petitioner requests the Court to divide their estate in a manner that the
Court deems just and right, as provided by law.

Petitioner should be awarded a disproportionate share of the parties' estate for the

following reasons, including but not limited to:

a. fault in the breakup of the marriage;

b. benefits the innocent spouse may have derived from the continuation of the
marriage;

& disparity of earning power of the spouses and their ability to support themselves;

d. health of the spouses;

€: the spouse to whom conservatorship of the children is granted;

f. needs of the children of the marriage;

g. education and future employability of the spouses;

h. community indebtedness and liabilities;

k. need for future support:

l. nature of the property involved in the division; and

=== PAGE 70 ===
--- OCR TEXT ---
m. attorney's fees to be paid.
11. Separate Property

Petitioner owns certain separate property that is not part of the community estate of the
parties, and Petitioner requests the Court to confirm that separate property as Petitioner's separate
property and estate.
12. Request for Permanent Injunction

Petitioner requests the Court, after trial on the merits, to grant the following permanent

injunction:
a. Petitioner requests that her contact information and residence information remain
confidential.

I 3, Request for Change of Name

Petitioner requests a change of name to MORGAN MICHELLE WILSON.
14. Attorney's Fees, Court Costs, Expenses, and Interest

It was necessary for Petitioner to secure the services of Cooper L. Carter, a licensed
attorney, to prepare and prosecute this suit. To effect an equitable division of the estate of the
parties and as a part of the division, and for services rendered in connection with conservatorship
and support of the children, judgment for reasonable and necessary attorney's fees, court costs,
and expenses through trial and appeal should be granted against Respondent and in favor of
Petitioner for the use and benefit of Petitioner's attorney and be ordered paid directly to
Petitioner's attorney, who may enforce the judgment in the attorney's own name. Petitioner
requests postjudgment interest as allowed by law.

Petitioner also requests that the previous attorney’s fees awarded to her during this case

be confirmed at final trial.

=== PAGE 71 ===
--- OCR TEXT ---
15. Prayer

Petitioner prays that citation and notice issue as required by law and that the Court grant a

divorce and all other relief requested in this petition.

Petitioner prays that, on final hearing, the Court enter a permanent injunction enjoining

Respondent, in conformity with the allegations of this petition, from the acts set forth above.

Petitioner prays that Petitioner's name be changed as requested above.

Petitioner prays for attorney's fees, court costs, and expenses as requested above.

Petitioner prays for general relief.

Makes sense.

This is not looking good.

Not only has Dan violated multiple protective orders in the past, but he's already plead
guilty to similar conduct in the past, revealing a pattern of behavior.

You also fabricated the affidavit of inability to pay, which makes the case Dismissable under
the Texas practice and remedies code and is a class C MISDEMEANOR.

You claimed both kids as dependants
Don't say I didn't give you every opportunity to correct this.
Now it's on you.

Oklahoma takes conspiracy to commit fraud very seriously.
