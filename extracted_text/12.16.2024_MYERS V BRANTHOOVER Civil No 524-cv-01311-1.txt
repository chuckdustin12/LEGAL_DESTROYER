FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT 
Plaintiff, Charles Dustin Myers, files this complaint against Defendant, Daniel 
Kenneth Branthoover, (“Branthoover, or “Defendant”), and alleges the foregoing: 
SUMMARY 
This case represents a chilling narrative of betrayal, deceit, and calculated malice. 
The Defendant, Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, did not merely engage in misconduct—
he orchestrated a deliberate and malicious scheme to dismantle the Plaintiff’s family, 
livelihood, and reputation. With reckless disregard for the truth, the Defendant 
manipulated legal processes, misappropriated marital assets, and weaponized the legal 
system to inflict maximum harm on the Plaintiff. The Defendant’s actions, supported by 
a disturbing pattern of harassment, theft, and intimidation, reveal a profound disregard

[Plaintiff] stated was hers and claimed Texas is a community property state. (Exhibit

beginning.’ (Exhibit 10)

18. When served with the documents prepared under the directive of 
Branthoover, they contained allegations of family violence, sexual harassment, and 
sought to have Plaintiff removed from the residence under the narrative of needing 
protection, and waived the 60-day waiting period for divorce claiming that an active 
order of protection existed against Plaintiff and that family violence had been found to 
have occurred during the marriage. (Exhibit 11)

Court of Appeals in Texas in April and March of 2024. (Exhibit 14)

24. On December 10th, 2024, Branthoover reached out once more and stated
“When things all over you get to deal with me. Just a heads up.”, a persistent theme 
since his involvement in mid December of 2023. (Exhibit 17) 
25. Branthoover’s egregious behavior is part of a larger pattern of conduct that
has led to significant financial and emotional harm suffered by Plaintiff and is rooted 
in intentional deception, entitling Plaintiff to recover damages because of the deceit. 
COUNT ONE: DECEIT 
Defendant’s actions constitute a violation of Title 76 OS § 1 et seq., as he 
knowingly and willfully deceived Plaintiff with the specific intent to induce 
detrimental reliance, thereby exposing Plaintiff to injury. Consequently, the 
Defendant is liable for the damages resulting from his conduct. 
26. Paragraphs 1 through 25 are incorporated herein by reference.
27. Defendant persuaded the Plaintiff that his wife bringing their children to his
residence was beneficial, suggesting a fact not believed to be true, as his real intention 
was to facilitate her legal actions against the Plaintiff, violating element 1 of deceit 76 
OK Stat § 3(1). 
28. Defendant knew this assertion to be false, as prior to making this statement
he was actively assisting wife in an effort to have the Plaintiff removed from his home 
through an ex-parte temporary order of protection. See Exhibit  
29. Defendant's selective disclosure to the Plaintiff about the discussions
surrounding the divorce, while concealing his significant involvement in drafting legal 
documents for the Wife, constitutes deceit under element 3 of 76 OK Stat § 3(3). By 
presenting only partial information and withholding his full participation, Defendant

provided misleading context that was likely to—and did—mislead the Plaintiff 
regarding the nature of his involvement, which lead to significant damages, making 
defendant liable for any damage which he thereby suffered. 
COUNT TWO: CONVERSION 
Defendant’s PayPal account was used as a medium to unlawfully convert $1,576 
from the Plaintiff’s marital estate the week before Christmas. 
30. Paragraphs 1 through 29 are incorporated herein by reference.
31. Plaintiff had a legal right to the funds in the joint PNC bank account,
including the specific sum of $1,576, as joint marital property. 
32. Defendant knowingly and intentionally exercised unauthorized control over
these funds by directing the transfer of $1,576 to his PayPal account on December 15, 
2023. 
33. Defendant’s actions deprived Plaintiff of the use and benefit of these funds,
causing financial harm, including an overdraft of $800, the loss of $1,576, the 
discontinuation of certain business advertising, and prevented him from getting his

34. Under Oklahoma and Texas law, conversion is complete when the holder of
personal property asserts rights inconsistent with the title of the owner. Russell v. City 
State Bank of Wellington, Texas, 264 F. Supp. at 574. In this case, Defendant’s conduct 
demonstrates an assertion of rights inconsistent with the Plaintiff’s ownership and legal 
entitlement to the funds. By knowingly and intentionally directing the transfer of $1,576 
from the joint marital account to his PayPal account without Plaintiff’s consent,

COUNT THREE:  INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL 
DISTRESS 
Defendant acted intentionally and recklessly, his conduct was extreme and 
outrageous, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages from this conduct, Plaintiff 
experienced emotional distress, and the emotional distress [is] severe. Ishmael v. 
Andrew, 2006 OK CIV APP 82, 19, 137 P.3d 1271, 1277; Breeden v. League

Defendant’s conduct was both intentional and reckless, as the fraudulent documents 
prepared by him lead to the loss of Plaintiff’s business, home, and the custody of this 
Children. 
37. After Plaintiff suffered these losses, Defendant continued to harass the
Plaintiff by texting him throughout the proceeds he helped initiate, calling him 
“pathetic” and stating that he has “enjoyed watching every filing get denied”. This 
conduct is outrageous because the harm suffered by Plaintiff was a direct cause of 
Defendant’s actions, and Defendant’s clear interest in the case has been made apparent

Services Corp., 1978 OK 27, 7, 575 P.2d 1374, 1376.

35. Paragraphs | through 34 are incorporated herein by reference.

36. Defendant’s conduct constitutes intentional infliction of emotional distress
as defined in the Restatement (Second) of Torts § 46 (1965), which states that “one
who by extreme and outrageous conduct intentionally or recklessly causes severe
emotional distress to another is subject to liability for such emotional distress.”.

notwithstanding his enjoyment of the damages he has caused to Plaintiff through his 
own admission. 
38. Further, Defendant knew that Plaintiff operated his business out of his
residency, knew of his recent success, his close relationship with his daughters, and 
was aware that Plaintiff was the primary breadwinner in the household, yet played an 
integral role in his unjust removal through deceptive measures. 
39. Finally, Defendant inflicted severe emotional distress on Plaintiff by
assisting in the act of up-ending his life by influencing his marriage to its’ detriment, 
helping sever the close relationship he had with his children, and playing a crucial role 
in the destruction of Plaintiff’s business he had built to provide for his family, causing 
reckless financial and emotional harm that has been ongoing since his involvement. 
40. Defendant’s self-admitted enjoyment of Plaintiff’s distress is particularly
egregious as it has affected far more than just Plaintiff’s well-being, but has undone 
years of hard work and the damage is ongoing and is expected to persist into the future 
considering that the case he helped initiate is fundamentally flawed and has been 
stagnant for nearly 10 months. 
DAMAGES 
Defendant’s actions alleged herein have caused significant and irreparable harm 
to Plaintiff and his family, who seeks redress in damages; compensatory and 
special, and seeks punitive damages to deter this behavior from occurring in the 
future.  
41. Paragraphs 1 through 40 are incorporated herein by reference.

notwithstanding his enjoyment of the damages he has caused to Plaintiff through his
own admission.

38. Further, Defendant knew that Plaintiff operated his business out of his
residency, knew of his recent success, his close relationship with his daughters, and
was aware that Plaintiff was the primary breadwinner in the household, yet played an
integral role in his unjust removal through deceptive measures.

39. Finally, Defendant inflicted severe emotional distress on Plaintiff by
assisting in the act of up-ending his life by influencing his marriage to its’ detriment,
helping sever the close relationship he had with his children, and playing a crucial role
in the destruction of Plaintiff's business he had built to provide for his family, causing
reckless financial and emotional harm that has been ongoing since his involvement.

40. Defendant’s self-admitted enjoyment of Plaintiff’s distress is particularly
egregious as it has affected far more than just Plaintiff's well-being, but has undone
years of hard work and the damage is ongoing and is expected to persist into the future
considering that the case he helped initiate is fundamentally flawed and has been
stagnant for nearly 10 months.

DAMAGES
Defendant’s actions alleged herein have caused significant and irreparable harm
to Plaintiff and his family, who seeks redress in damages; compensatory and
special, and seeks punitive damages to deter this behavior from occurring in the

future.

41. Paragraphs 1 through 40 are incorporated herein by reference.

42. Under Oklahoma law, any person who suffers detriment from the unlawful
act or omission of another may recover compensation in the form of damages. (See 
Okla. Stat. tit. 23, § 3). Plaintiff has suffered significant detriment due to Defendant's 
conduct, including the loss of income, increased living expense, personal and marital 
property, harm to his business, and harm to his familial relationships, which have all 
caused severe emotional distress. 
Loss of income 
43. Starting in December 2023, the Defendant’s involvement directly disrupted
Plaintiff’s ability to focus on business operations and maintain client relationships. 
This disruption coincided with an accelerated decline in income, as reflected by 
Plaintiff’s income showing a sharper drop in monthly earnings. 
44. Prior to the Defendant’s involvement, Plaintiff’s average monthly income
from Source 1 was approximately $3,612.83 over the 13 months preceding December 
2023. Following the Defendant’s involvement, Plaintiff’s average monthly income 
dropped to $1,813.02, representing a significant reduction of nearly 50%. Over the 
subsequent 13 months, this decline resulted in a total income loss of approximately 
$23,397.60 (Exhibit A) as a direct result of Defendant’s actions. 
45. Similarly, Plaintiff’s Source 2 transaction revenue data reflects a comparable
trend. The annual transaction revenue dropped from $26,514.94 in 2023 to $15,099.78 
in 2024, resulting in a loss of $11,415.16 over that period. (Exhibit B)

46. The total realized loss of income, combining the actual reductions in earnings
from Source 1 and Source 2, is $34,812.76 since being removed from the residence. The 
projected loss of income over the next 12 months, based on forward-looking projections 
for Source 1 and Source 2, is $33,012.94 in consequential damages. Combined, the total 
loss of income is projected at $67,825.69 by this time next year given all circumstances 
are the same and factoring in consequential damages. 
47. Defendant’s actions have caused advertisements to stop running for
Plaintiff’s business, which have resulted in lost business opportunities and decreased 
website traffic, leading to lost business opportunities estimated at $14,200. (Exhibit C) 
Increased living expenses 
48. During the pendency of the litigation instigated by Defendant, Plaintiff has
been unable to access his home, resulting in a substantial increase in living costs to 
remain near his children as they had been accustomed to. 
49. This forced Defendant to stay in hotels to exercise Thursday visitation and
required him to rent local Airbnb locations to provide a stable living space for his 
children during extended periods. The total cost of Airbnb during the relevant period is 
$14,553.89, and additional hotel costs amount to $873.31 to maintain the status quo of 
the Children to the best of Plaintiff’s ability. (Exhibit D) 
50. Plaintiff also incurred toll costs while exercising visitation to see his children,
totaling $2,160.28. This includes $450.61 and $492.00 on June 9, $887.92 on April 11, 
and $329.75 on April 26. These incurred expenses would not have been necessary if not

subsequently diverting marital funds and orchestrating the initiation of divorce 
proceedings with the intent to cause harm. These actions displaced the Plaintiff from 
his livelihood and were accompanied by mockery of his efforts to seek relief. Such 
reckless conduct constitutes calculated deceit carried out with malice.
