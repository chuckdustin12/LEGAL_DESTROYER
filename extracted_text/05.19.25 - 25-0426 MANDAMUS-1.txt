Statement of the Case 
Nature of Underlying Proceeding: This original proceeding arises from a divorce 
action, No. 322-744263-23, pending in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County, 
Texas. The Relator initiated recusal proceedings under Texas Rule of Civil 
Procedure 18a, which remain pending. The issues presented concern the improper 
handling of those recusal procedures. 
Respondent Judge: The Respondent Judge, Honorable David L. Evans, is the 
presiding Regional Judge of the 8th Administrative Judicial Region of Texas. 
Respondent’s Challenged Actions: The Respondent erred when he overruled the 
Relator's objection requesting that the mandatory procedures set forth in Rule 18a 
of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure be followed. Further, permitting a judge to 
file an order of referral regarding a recusal motion where he was not named 
introduces confusion and undermines the purpose of the rule, causes further delays, 
and leaves the Relator without an adequate appellate remedy.

Statement of Jurisdiction 
This Petition for Writ of Mandamus is properly filed in the Supreme Court 
of Texas, which possesses original jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus against 
regional presiding judges pursuant to Article V, Section 3 of the Texas Constitution 
and Texas Government Code § 22.002(a). In contrast, the jurisdiction of 
intermediate appellate courts is governed by Texas Government Code § 22.221, 
and the Legislature has not conferred upon those courts the authority to issue writs 
of mandamus against regional presiding judges. 
This original proceeding is properly presented to this Honorable Court in the 
first instance due to the jurisdictional limitations of the Second Court of Appeals 
and because three previously filed mandamus proceedings—arising from the same 
case and naming the same parties—are currently pending before this Court under 
cause numbers 25-0361, 25-0367, and 25-0378.

Statement of Facts 
“MR” in this section refers to the mandamus record filed concurrently with this 
petition. “APP” refers to the mandamus appendix attached hereto. 
 
On April 23, 2025, in the midst of three concurrent mandamus proceedings 
in the Second Court of Appeals1, the trial court below, on its’ own initiative, and 
after several months of silence, sua sponte moved to set the matter for final trial 
(MR 1-1.1). The same day, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, (“the Relator”) filed 
notice with the Second Court of Appeals warning that more errors would likely be 
committed by the trial court given this sudden decision to move to final trial (MR 
2-2.1). The Relator then objected in the trial court to this setting and reminded the 
court that there were three concurrent mandamus proceedings pending in the 
Second Court of Appeals (MR 3.1) and named six specific issues that needed to be 
resolved before moving to final trial (MR 3.2). 
 
The following day, the Second Court of Appeals issued a per curiam denial 
regarding 02-25-00166-CV, which is now before this court as cause number 25-
0361 (MR 4-4.1). The Relator then filed a Plea to the Jurisdiction directed to 
Honorable James Munford and reiterated several key issues and questioned the 
court’s jurisdiction and re-raised constitutional issues (MR 5-5.11). On April 25, 
2025, the Relator filed a Motion to Recuse in the 322nd District Court seeking to

recuse the Honorable James Munford (MR 6-6.21) to protect his rights. The recusal 
included several exhibits, including the Notice of Court Proceeding (MR 6.22-
6.24), the current temporary orders in effect that claim consent yet lack the 
Relator’s signature (MR. 6.25-6.36), the prior recusal denial (MR. 6.37-6.39), the

Following the submission of his Motion to Recuse, the Relator received 
notice from the Real Party in Interest, Morgan Michelle Myers, that their youngest 
child had sustained a dental injury. In response, Relator notified the Second Court 
of Appeals (MR. 7–7.4) and submitted the same notice to the 322nd District Court, 
amending the filing to correct a date reference (MR. 8–8.6).

(MR. 10–10.6). 
On April 29, 2025, letters from the District Judge and the Associate Judge 
were filed (MR. 11; MR. 12). Each declined to recuse and referred the matter to 
Judge David L. Evans of the 8th Administrative Judicial Region (MR. 13; APP 3). 
Relator filed an Objection to the Recusal Procedure, stating that the motion named 
only the District Judge and not the Associate Judge, and challenged the inclusion 
of the latter and objected to the court coordinator’s involvement (MR 14). 
Two days later, the Second Court of Appeals entered denials in cause

These matters were then docketed before this Court as cause numbers 25-0367 and

respondents (APP 2) and used the 322nd District Court's coordinator to transmit 
documents, a method Relator challenged as improper and filed a second objection

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT 
Texas law assigns the court clerk — not the challenged judge or his personal 
staff — the duty of transmitting recusal materials. Rule 18a’s forwarding 
requirement is statutorily designated to the clerk of the court where the motion was 
filed. Allowing a judge’s court coordinator or personal assistant (a staff member 
appointed by the judge) to carry out that delivery would depart from the neutral 
procedure envisioned by the rule. A coordinator is a direct appointee of the judge 
and serves at his pleasure; having such a person handle a motion challenging the 
judge’s own authority undermines the independence of the process. In other words, 
the clerk is a neutral custodian of court records, whereas a coordinator is part of the 
judge’s office. In the recusal context, it is far safer to use the clerk (or an independent 
deputy) to send the papers on, so that no one can reasonably think the judge is

confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary”. In practice this means

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

Texas law assigns the court clerk — not the challenged judge or his personal
staff — the duty of transmitting recusal materials. Rule 18a’s forwarding
requirement is statutorily designated to the clerk of the court where the motion was
filed. Allowing a judge’s court coordinator or personal assistant (a staff member
appointed by the judge) to carry out that delivery would depart from the neutral
procedure envisioned by the rule. A coordinator is a direct appointee of the judge
and serves at his pleasure; having such a person handle a motion challenging the
judge’s own authority undermines the independence of the process. In other words,
the clerk is a neutral custodian of court records, whereas a coordinator is part of the
judge’s office. In the recusal context, it is far safer to use the clerk (or an independent
deputy) to send the papers on, so that no one can reasonably think the judge is
influencing the referral.

Beyond the letter of Rule 18a, Texas’s Code of Judicial Conduct mandates
avoiding not only actual bias but any appearance of impropriety or partiality. Canon
2(A) provides that a judge “should act at all times in a manner that promotes public
confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary”. In practice this means
even the perception of favoritism or undue influence must be avoided. Here, the
Respondent’s order overruling the Relator’s objection has the opposite effect,

constituting an abuse of discretion leaving the Relator without an appellate remedy.

ARGUMENT 
A. Standard of Review 
To obtain relief by writ of mandamus, a relator must establish that an 
underlying order is void or a clear abuse of discretion and that no adequate appellate 
remedy exists. Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 839–40 (Tex.1992) (orig. 
proceeding). An abuse of discretion occurs when a trial court's ruling is arbitrary and 
unreasonable, made without regard for guiding legal principles or supporting 
evidence. Ford Motor Co. v. Garcia, 363 S.W.3d 573, 578 (Tex.2012). Similarly, a 
trial court abuses its discretion when it fails to analyze or apply the law correctly. In 
re Sw. Bell Tel. Co., 226 S.W.3d 400, 403 (Tex.2007). The Relator submits that the 
Respondent clearly abused his discretion by not following the mandatory procedural 
requirements of Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure which has 
undermined the recusal process. 
B. Government Code § 74.102(b) Does Not Excuse Noncompliance With Rule 
18a 
 
The Court Administration Act, Government Code Chapter 74, sets broad 
administrative standards but does not repeal or override other laws. Section 
74.102(a) provides that “by local administrative rule” courts shall designate the 
duties of court coordinators. More importantly, 74.101(b) specifies that each 
coordinator serves “at the pleasure of the judge who appointed him.” Here, the

requirements of Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure which has
undermined the recusal process.

B. Government Code § 74.102(b) Does Not Excuse Noncompliance With Rule
18a

The Court Administration Act, Government Code Chapter 74, sets broad
administrative standards but does not repeal or override other laws. Section
74.102(a) provides that “by local administrative rule” courts shall designate the
duties of court coordinators. More importantly, 74.101(b) specifies that each

coordinator serves “at the pleasure of the judge who appointed him.” Here, the

coordinator in question serves at the pleasure of the judge subject to recusal.  Texas 
law implicitly assigns the court clerk — not the challenged judge or his personal 
staff — the duty of transmitting recusal materials. Rule 18a’s forwarding 
requirement is typically performed by the clerk of the court where the motion was 
filed. Allowing a judge’s court coordinator or personal assistant (a staff member 
appointed by the judge) to carry out that delivery would depart from the neutral 
procedure envisioned by the rule. Because a coordinator is a direct appointee of the 
judge and serves at his pleasure - having such a person handle a motion challenging 
the judge’s own authority undermines the independence of the process. In other 
words, the clerk is a neutral custodian of court records, whereas a coordinator is part 
of the judge’s office. In the recusal context, Rule 18a(e) specifically delineates duties 
to the clerk of the court, not the coordinator. 
 
In the Respondent’s order overruling the Relator’s objection, the invocation 
of 74.102(b) was misplaced (APP 1.1). This section simply reinforces that court 
coordinators must work smoothly with judges; it does not allow a coordinator or 
clerk to disregard the clear instructions of Rule 18a. Nor does § 74.102(b) itself 
confer discretion to the clerk that would override the rule’s requirements. The only 
plausible understanding of Section 74.102(b) is that it calls for cooperation in 
effectuating rules like 18a, not for deviation from them, which is what occurred 
here. In Rio Grande Valley Gas Co., In re, 987 S.W.2d 167 (Tex. App. 1999), the

court explicitly stated that recusal motions must be filed "with the clerk of the 
court." This further reinforces that the clerk, not a court coordinator, is the proper 
recipient of recusal-related filings. Likewise, in In re Amir-Sharif, NUMBER 13-
19-00573-CV (Tex. App. Dec 12, 2019), the court stated that the respondent judge 
"must either: (A) sign and file with the clerk an order of recusal or disqualification; 
or (B) sign and file with the clerk an order referring the motion to the regional 
presiding judge." This explicit reference to filing "with the clerk” is directly 
supported by rule 18a(e). Here, deviation from these mandatory procedural 
requirements has proven to be inefficient and have undermined the recusal process 
itself in a case already fraught with procedural abnormalities. 
C. The involvement of the coordinator in this instance has proven to be 
inefficient and has undermined the integrity of the recusal process
By involving the court coordinator, the straightforward process of recusal 
has become ambiguous. Rule 18a(c) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure makes 
clear that the judge’s obligation to address recusal arises only after a motion is duly 
filed: the rule commands that if a party “raises a ground requiring recusal,” then 
the judge “shall either recuse himself or request the presiding judge” to take the 
motion. Here Judge Evans’ order overruling the Relator’s objection to Honorable 
Jeff Kaitcer’s involvement but permitting the issue to be discussed during the 
recusal proceedings is not only prejudicial, but it will waste further judicial 
resources and cause further delay to the relief being sought. A judge must base

decisions on what is actually in the record. It is apparent on the face of the record 
and the motion to recuse that Honorable Jeff Kaitcer was not named in the motion. 
This implies that the motion was not properly reviewed, or the trial court is trying 
to create an illusion of an adequate appellate remedy to thwart cause number 25-
0361 pending before this court. The only mention of any recusal regarding 
Honorable Jeff Kaitcer in the current proceedings was a reference made to the 
prior recusal proceedings initiated on October 7, 2024 (See MR. 9.19-9.20). 
Notably, the court coordinator was involved in those proceedings as well, which 
ended up resulting in a four month delay that was only cured by the Respondent’s 
diligence in reminding the coordinator that the judges were not reinstated into the 
case while opposing parties remained inactive throughout that critical delay. (MR 
8.1) (emphasis added). 
 
In essence, the Respondent’s invocation of 74.102(b) in the order overruling 
the Relator’s objection, even if correct, would not effectuate its purpose of 
ensuring “uniform and efficient administration of justice in this state” by involving 
the court coordinator. Here, inconsistent proceedings have resulted from this 
involvement, significant delays have occurred, and now the Relator faces recusal 
proceedings wherein a Judge not named in the motion has inappropriately 
implicated himself in the proceedings. This error could have been easily resolved 
by vacating the order, but it instead has created unnecessary ambiguity.

D. No triggering motion makes Honorable Jeff Kaitcer’s Order of Referral
Erroneous
Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, no recusal procedure is triggered 
until a valid motion is filed. Once a recusal motion is filed, the challenged judge 
must either recuse or immediately forward the motion to the presiding judge. See In 
re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, orig. 
proceeding); See also In re Stearman, 252 S.W.3d 113 (Tex. App.—Waco 2008, 
orig. proceeding).  Absent any motion, however, the judge has no authority to 
initiate or refer a recusal proceeding. Here, the Relator's motion to recuse did not 
seek recusal of Judge Kaitcer, yet the court overruled his objection to his referral 
order. In doing so, the court ignored the Rule’s plain text: a judge may “make no 
further orders and shall take no further action in the case after filing of the motion 
and prior to a hearing on the motion”. Id. The court’s suggestion that the assigned 
judge may nonetheless consider the Relator's admitted non-filing only underscores 
the error – it treats an unfiled motion as if it were pending. In re Norman is 
instructive: under Rule 18a a judge has “no option” other than to recuse or refer 
when a motion is pending. By contrast, here no motion to recuse has been filed 
regarding the Associate Judge, so the Honorable Kaitcer’s referral was in error, and 
the Respondent had no lawful basis to adjudicate it. For these reasons, the order 
was plainly erroneous, and these actions have undermined the recusal process 
which is intended to promote public confidence in the judiciary.

CONCLUSION 
In sum, the order overruling Relator’s objection reflects more than a mere 
procedural disagreement—it constitutes a refusal to follow the mandatory 
directives of Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a. Specifically, 18a(e) vests specific 
procedural duties in the clerk, not the court coordinator. (emphasis added) The 
legislature’s choice of language was deliberate: Rule 18a(e) assigns responsibility 
for receiving, managing, and transmitting recusal motions exclusively to the clerk 
of the court. Nowhere does it authorize a judge’s personal appointee—such as a 
court coordinator—to assume or interfere with these statutory duties. 
Here, a motion was ever filed to recuse Associate Judge Jeff Kaitcer. Yet 
despite the absence of a triggering event, Judge Kaitcer issued a referral order 
under Rule 18a as though a motion were pending. That referral had no lawful 
basis, and any action taken in response—including the overruling of Relator’s 
objection—is procedurally void. Rule 18a requires a motion before it imposes any 
duty or limitation. Without such a filing, Judge Kaitcer lacked authority to refer 
the case, and the assigned judge lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate a nonexistent 
motion. 
By further permitting a judge-appointed coordinator to process these 
materials, the trial court not only misapplied the Rule—it overlooked its core

file with the clerk an order of recusal or disqualification; or (B) sign and file with the clerk an
order referring the motion to the regional presiding judge.

motion has been filed under the Civil Practice and Remedies Code. (B) Motion to Disqualify. A
motion to disqualify may not be denied on the ground that it was not filed or served in
compliance with this rule.

issue interim or ancillary orders in the pending case as justice may require.
(5) Discovery. Except by order of the regional presiding judge or the judge assigned to decide
the motion, a subpoena or discovery request may not issue to the respondent judge and may be
disregarded unless accompanied by the order.
(6) Hearing. (A) Time. The motion must be heard as soon as practicable and may be heard
immediately after it is referred to the regional presiding judge or an assigned judge. (B) Notice.
Notice of the hearing must be given to all parties in the case. (C) By Telephone. The hearing
may be conducted by telephone on the record. Documents submitted by facsimile or email,
otherwise admissible under the rules of evidence, may be considered.
(7) Reassignment of Case if Motion Granted. If the motion is granted, the regional presiding
judge must transfer the case to another court or assign another judge to the case.
(h)Sanctions. After notice and hearing, the judge who hears the motion may order the party or
attorney who filed the motion, or both, to pay the reasonable attorney fees and expenses incurred by
other parties if the judge determines that the motion was:
