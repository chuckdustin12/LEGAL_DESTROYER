I. 
REASONS FOR REHEARING 
 
Relator respectfully submits this Motion for 
Rehearing pursuant to TEX. R. APP. P § 49.1, and which 
should be granted for the following reasons: 
A.  Issue 
On April 8th, 2024, Relator filed for a 
petition for writ of Mandamus and 
concurrently requested temporary relief , 
where it went before Justices Walker, Womack, 
and Wallach, JJ, who issued a memorandum 
opinion denying the emergency relief sought 
and petition with a general denial.1  
The issue and need for re-hearing is not 
due to the opinion of this Honorable Court, 
but in-fact is within the Relator’s petition 
 
1 “The court has considered relator’s petition for writ of mandamus and motion for emergency relief and is of 
the opinion that relief should be denied. Accordingly, relator’s petition for writ of mandamus and motion for 
emergency relief are denied.”

REASONS FOR REHEARING

Relator respectfully submits this Motion for
Rehearing pursuant to TEX. R. APP. P § 49.1, and which

should be granted for the following reasons:

A. Issue

On April 8t8, 2024, Relator filed for a
petition for writ of Mandamus and
concurrently requested temporary relief ,
where it went before Justices Walker, Womack,
and Wallach, JJ, who issued a memorandum
Opinion denying the emergency relief sought

and petition with a general denial.!

The issue and need for re-hearing is not
due to the opinion of this Honorable Court,

but in-fact is within the Relator’s petition

™“The court has considered relator’s petition for writ of mandamus and motion for emergency relief and is of
the opinion that relief should be denied. Accordingly, relator’s petition for writ of mandamus and motion for
emergency relief are denied.”

for mandamus itself. The petition lacked 
certified copies of the record, was missing 
one respondent2, and contained over-redacted 
documents critical to the case – making it 
impossible for this Court to conduct judicial 
review3 – thereby warranting the general 
denial issued. 
B.  Rule 
The appendix to a petition for mandamus must 
contain a certified or sworn copy of any order 
complained of, or any other document showing the 
matter complained of.4 In practice, this refers to 
the key documents such as motions and orders that 
are central to the discussion in a petition for a

writ of mandamus or that are relied upon for the 
relief sought. 
Given that strict adherence to this rule is 
mandatory for the Relator’s petition for mandamus to 
warrant a thorough judicial review5, and given the 
over-redaction of documents within the Relator’s 
compiled record, this Honorable Court could not 
determine what the trial court reviewed in reaching 
its’ decision based on these errors. 
In light of the above, the Relator’s petition 
for writ of mandamus could not have possibly met the 
two-pronged burden to warrant mandamus relief set 
forth in Walker vs. Packer6 and was unable to 
demonstrate that the trial court’s decisions within 
this case were arbitrary, or unreasonable.7

C.  Application 
The Relator has filed with this motion for 
rehearing a certified record that contains the 
matters complained of in the original petition for 
writ of mandamus and motion for emergency relief. 
The Relator has also corrected the redaction 
errors within the petition which will allow this 
Honorable Court to give a thorough judicial review 
of the record, and issue the mandamus relief sought 
when the clear abuse of discretion by the trial 
court is discovered on the face of the record.  
This rehearing motion is critical to address 
the significant errors made not only in the 
Relator’s original petition, but also the 
misapplications of law committed by the trial court. 
Now that the face of the record is uncovered, 
this Court can accurately relate the presented 
issues to the underlying facts given its’ ability

PRAYER 
 
The Relator respectfully requests that this 
Honorable Court compel the Respondent(s) to submit a 
response to this motion for rehearing, thereby enabling 
a thorough review and potential granting of the relief 
sought in the petition for Mandamus.  
Additionally, the Relator urges the Court to conduct 
a detailed examination of his petition for a writ of 
mandamus and motion for emergency relief, considering 
the now available and adequate record that substantiates 
the claims and aligns with the facts of the case. 
In the alternative, should the Court find the 
current submissions insufficient, the Relator seeks 
leave to file a corrected petition for writ of mandamus 
and an amended motion for emergency relief.

Background Report for Case Consolidation

Case Details:

Divorce Case (Cause No. 322-744263-23) in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County, filed on
December 18, 2023.

Protective Order Case (Cause No. 322-744538-23) in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County.

Reasons for Consolidation:

Interconnected Issues:

The divorce case and the protective order case involve overlapping issues concerning family violence
allegations, which are central to the divorce proceedings and directly affect custody and visitation rights.
The protective order case includes allegations of family violence, which are also a pivotal point in the
divorce case in determining the waiver of the standard waiting period for the divorce.

Consistency in Rulings:

Consolidating the divorce and protective order cases would ensure consistency in the court's findings,
particularly regarding any allegations of family violence and their impact on the dissolution of marriage,
custody, and visitation rights.

Judicial Economy:

Hearing both cases together would promote judicial economy by avoiding duplication of legal
proceedings, as both cases are likely to involve similar witnesses, evidence, and legal arguments.

Claims of False Statements:

There have been claims of false statements and perjury related to the protective order, which could have
significant implications for the divorce case. For instance, the claim that the plaintiff intentionally lied
about being unable to pay court fees and made false allegations of family violence to gain an advantage
in the divorce proceedings suggests that a single judge should hear both matters for a clear
understanding of the facts.

APP 8:2

--- OCR TEXT ---
Evidence of Misrepresentation and False Statements:

Evidence provided suggests that there have been misrepresentations to the court, including the transfer
of funds from the joint account and the plaintiff's interaction with third parties, which could affect both
the protective order and the divorce outcome. The protective order — which was based on claims of
family violence — are entirely baseless as | have no record of family violence, and no evidence from the
Plaintiff has been provided to substantiate these claims.

Landlord-Tenant Relationship:

The eviction case, although not directly related to family law matters, stems from claims and actions that
are deeply intertwined with the divorce and protective order cases, suggesting that the alleged family
violence and the actions of the plaintiff have been used to justify an eviction that coincides with the
timing of the divorce and protective order filings.

Conclusion:

Given the overlapping factual and legal issues in the divorce and protective order cases, consolidation
would serve the interests of justice and efficiency. It would ensure that the court has a comprehensive
understanding of the intertwined nature of the family's circumstances, which is vital for fair and
equitable resolution of these matters. While the eviction case may not be directly consolidated due to
jurisdictional differences, it should be considered in context with the other cases to provide a complete
picture of the ongoing disputes and to keep the best interests of our children intact.

Charles Myers

3. Unfounded Claims in Eviction Suit and Protective Order: Both the eviction suit and the protective
order claims are unfounded. The eviction suit lists the violation of the lease as "granddaughter
divorced" and prematurely references the protective order as a secondary reason for eviction
grounds. Additional time is needed to address these premature and baseless claims. There is no
immediate danger to the Plaintiff, or the children — and has never been any incident of family
violence that has occurred within our home. Attached is a copy of my criminal history obtained
by the Texas Department of Public Safety that highlights my clean record.

4. Time to appropriately answer the divorce: The parent case in the request to consolidate is the
divorce, which | have yet to answer due to the concurrent proceedings (eviction suit and
protective order) which were both filed due to the claims that | possess a history of family
violence, waiving the 60-day period for service and making the timeframe unreasonable —
especially considering the lack of communications from the Plaintiffs — to formulate a plan that
best suits our children’s interests.

5. Lack of Cooperation in Providing Lease Agreement: Despite requests, the Plaintiff has not
provided a copy of the lease agreement necessary for my defense. More time is needed to
acquire these critical documents, especially given the unlawful nature of the eviction.

6. Potential for Amicable Resolution: Given more time to prepare and the pending decision on the
consolidation of cases, there is a potential for a more amicable resolution to be reached. The
intertwined nature of the cases suggests that a holistic approach to resolution may be more
appropriate and beneficial for all parties involved.

Considering the above reasons, continuity is necessary to ensure a fair and just resolution of this matter.
| assure the Court that this request is not for the purpose of delay, but to allow for adequate preparation
and the pursuit of justice.

WHEREFORE PREMISES CONSIDERED, |, Charles Dustin Myers, respectfully request that the Court grant a
continuance for the protective order case.

Respectfully submitted,

COUNTER-PETITION FOR DIVORCE AND COMPREHENSIVE STATEMENT OF CONTEXT

I. OVERVIEW AND CONTEXT

This divorce is intertwined with two additional legal proceedings - an eviction suit (Case No. JP01-23-
E£00102017) and a protective order (Case No. 322-744538-23), both of which are deeply entangled with

The significant third-party influence exerted by individuals named Debbie, Damen, and Dan, as well as 
our landlord – her Grandmother – who lives next door to us - has critically impacted the Plaintiff's 
decisions and actions in our marital matters and the ongoing divorce proceedings. Notably, Dan 
Branthoover, a family member, has played an active and concerning role in the process – claiming to be 
her legal representative yet possessing no license to practice law in the state of Texas. 
1.
Debbie and Damen's Influence:
I possess extensive text and call logs that unequivocally demonstrate the Plaintiff's prioritization
of Debbie and Damen over our family obligations and commitments. These interactions, which
have been meticulously logged and analyzed, reveal a consistent pattern where the Plaintiff has
chosen to allocate a significant amount of her time and attention to these individuals, even
amidst our divorce proceedings. It wasn’t until the discovery and subsequent discussion of these
interactions that lead to the situation escalating. It is my firm belief that the protective order was
filed in an attempt to escape responsibility rather than to seek protection, as we have been co-
habiting throughout this process, and joint conservatorship was requested on the original
divorce petition.
2.
Dan Branthoover's Role:
Dan Branthoover's involvement has escalated beyond mere influence to active participation in
the legal aspects of our divorce. He has notably assisted the Plaintiff in preparing and filing
divorce papers.
Critically, under Dan's advice, the Plaintiff withdrew $1,600 from our joint bank account without
my authorization. This unauthorized transaction led to a dire financial situation, with a deficit of
$800 in our account, resulting in bounced bills and considerable strain on my business
operations.
This act of financial maneuvering, advised and facilitated by Dan, not only infringed upon our
mutual financial responsibilities but also breached the trust inherent in our joint financial
management. It underscores the extent of third-party involvement in our personal and legal
affairs.
3.
Communication Breakdown:
Throughout these developments, the Plaintiff has consistently failed to communicate with me
about these significant third-party influences and their implications on our divorce and family
dynamics. This lack of communication has been a major contributing factor to the
misunderstandings and the subsequent escalation of conflict between us.
The involvement of these third parties, particularly the actions taken by Dan Branthoover, have
not only influenced the Plaintiff’s decisions but also actively interfered with our joint financial
integrity and the legal process. This has added layers of complexity to an already challenging
situation and has necessitated the presentation of this comprehensive account in the interest of
transparency and fairness in these proceedings.

Deterioration of Parental Responsibility
Since the announcement of our divorce on December 1st, 2023, there has been a noticeable and
concerning shift in Morgan’s parenting responsibilities and her involvement in our children’s
lives. Prior to this date, Morgan was an engaged and active parent. However, since the
announcement, her day-to-day interactions with Mara and Caroline have noticeably
deteriorated. This change is not only alarming but also detrimental to the well-being and
emotional stability of our children.
Morgan has increasingly prioritized her personal interests, specifically her interactions with
friends, Debbie, and Damen, over her responsibilities as a mother. It has been observed and
documented that she spends an excessive amount of time, estimated to be up to 24 hours per
week, visiting these friends. This extensive time spent away from home has not only reduced her
physical presence in our children's lives but also impacted her emotional availability to them.
More concerning is the complete lack of effort on Morgan's part to communicate effectively
about the children’s needs, their daily routines, and their emotional well-being since the divorce
announcement. This breakdown in communication is critical, as co-parenting effectively is
paramount for the children's adjustment to the changes in our family structure. The inability or
unwillingness to engage in meaningful dialogue regarding our children’s care is not in their best
interest and is counterproductive to their needs during this challenging time.
5.
Contradicting and False Statements
Throughout the ongoing divorce proceedings, there have been several instances of contradictory
and demonstrably false statements made by Morgan, which have significantly complicated and
distorted the case. A critical point of contention is Morgan's claim regarding her inability to pay,
which is incongruent with the financial facts presented. Additionally, her request for the waiver
of the standard 60-day waiting period for divorce, citing an alleged order that found I had
committed family violence, is entirely baseless and untrue.
There is no evidence or record to substantiate claims of family violence in our marriage. In fact,
this assertion directly contradicts my clean record and consistent history of being a caring and
non-violent partner and father. The accusation appears to be a strategic move to gain an unfair
advantage in the divorce proceedings.
Furthermore, Morgan's actions in filing a protective order, followed by the initiation of an
eviction process, appear to be coordinated attempts to remove me from our family home.
Notably, the eviction notice cited the protective order as a reason, even though the protective
order had not been filed at the time of the eviction notice. This sequence of events points
towards a premeditated strategy to unfairly influence the custody and property aspects of our
divorce.
Given these concerning developments, it is imperative that this counter petition replace the
original. This counter-petition is not just a necessary step to address the false allegations and

contradicting statements made by Morgan, but also a crucial measure to ensure a fair and

2.
Data Analysis and Phone/Text Logs:
I have prepared charts and graphs created from our joint account's text and phone call logs.
These will illustrate the extreme levels of interaction the Plaintiff had with Debbie and Damen,
highlighting her priorities outside of our marriage. This priority in her friends has remained
consistent - even throughout the divorce proceedings.

No History of Family Violence:
I will present my criminal record from the Texas Department of Public Safety, proving the
absence of any history of family violence.
4.
Bank Statements and Financial Transactions:
Evidence of bank transactions will demonstrate financial maneuverings by the Plaintiff, advised
by Dan Branthoover, affecting our joint account.

Eviction Notice and Protective Order Claims:
I have the eviction notice served to me, which was later voided, and evidence related to the
protective order, demonstrating the misuse of legal processes to influence our divorce and
custody proceedings.

III. CHILDREN'S WELFARE AND FAMILY STABILITY
The children's welfare remains my primary concern. The Plaintiff's actions, influenced by third parties 
and her unfounded claims, threaten our children's stability and well-being. I advocate for maintaining 
the standard 60-day waiting period for the divorce to provide our children with a stable and gradual 
transition. 
Since the divorce announcement, I have remained an active role in my children’s lives, finding activities 
for us to do together due to their time off from school. Despite all inclusion efforts – Morgan has 
declined to join us on these activities – something the children don’t understand and have taken notice 
to. Morgan, on the other hand, has been extremely short with the children, impatient, and has kept her 
priorities in line with her friends. 
IV. PROPOSAL FOR INTERIM CUSTODY ARRANGEMENT
Considering the current complexities surrounding our divorce proceedings, and with the paramount goal 
of ensuring the best interests and minimal disruption to our children’s lives, I propose the following 
interim custody arrangement: 
1.
Full Custody Arrangement
I propose to take on full custody of our children, M
and C
. This decision is motivated by the 
need to provide them with a stable and consistent environment, especially during this transitional 
phase of our family's life. My commitment to their day-to-day needs, emotional well-being, and 
continued growth has been and will remain unwavering. 
2.
Co-Habitation in Current Family Home:
Recognizing the importance of maintaining a sense of normalcy for our children, I suggest that we 
continue to cohabit in our current family home. This arrangement will prevent any immediate 
upheaval in the children's living environment, allowing them to retain their sense of security and 
familiarity amidst the ongoing changes, and will afford Morgan the opportunity to find full-time 
stable employment, and allow me to continue making rent payments to her grandmother, our 
landlord. This is in the best interest of all parties involved. 
3.

and equally accommodating residence is secured. The aim is to ensure this new home is near our

usual routines and social connections. 
4.
Active Roles for Both Parents
 It is imperative that both Morgan and I continue to play active roles in our children's lives. The 
proposed arrangement is designed to facilitate this by ensuring that the children have regular and 
consistent access to both parents. This continued parental presence will be crucial in minimizing the 
emotional and psychological impact of our separation on M
and C

Mitigating Potential Damage: The current petition, as it stands, poses a significant risk of causing 
disruption and potential harm to our children's well-being. 
by abruptly altering their living situation and limiting their access to one parent. My proposal aims to 
mitigate this damage by providing a more balanced and thoughtful approach to the transition, one 
that prioritizes the emotional and psychological health of our children above all else. 
Flexibility and Cooperation: This proposal is made with a spirit of flexibility and cooperation, 
understanding that the situation may evolve as we navigate this process. I am open to discussions 
and modifications to this plan, if they serve the best interests of M
 and C
. 
Professional Support if Needed: To aid in this transition and to ensure that the emotional needs of 
our children are being met, I also propose that we engage the services of a child psychologist or a 
family counselor. This professional can provide support to M
 and C
, helping them to 
understand and adapt to the changes in their family dynamics. 
Regular Review and Adjustment of the Arrangement: I propose that this interim custody 
arrangement be subject to regular review, with the possibility of adjustments based on the evolving 
needs of our children and our family situation. This will ensure that the arrangement remains 
relevant and beneficial for M
 and C

STATEMENT 
I, Charles Dustin Myers, submit this unsworn declaration to recount the events since
December 1st, 2023, when my wife, Morgan Michelle Myers, unexpectedly declared
her wish for a divorce. The announcement was not only ill-timed but also perplexing in
its lack of substantiated reasoning or opportunity for reconciliation.
At noon that day, Morgan cited 'the way I talk to her' as her rationale for the divorce.
Despite her evolving reasons, I extended apologies and exhaustively sought resolution,
yet my every attempt to discuss our daughters' future and our family's welfare was met
with hostility or outright dismissal by Morgan.
The abruptness of Morgan's hostility compelled me to seek deeper insight. Upon
examining our AT&T records, I found an alarmingly high volume of communication
between Morgan and two individuals: Debbie and Damen. These findings were
troubling, especially given the children's scant interaction with Debbie's family despite
Morgan's extensive evening visits. When presented with this evidence, Morgan
downplayed its significance and persisted in her communications and visits, placing
them above resolving our marital issues.
After sharing my concerns with her grandparents, our landlords, the dynamics shifted
abruptly. Within days, Morgan began to systematically exclude me from the family
narrative surrounding the divorce.
The situation intensified on December 14th, 2023, with the involvement of Dan
Branthoover, her mother's boyfriend. Dan contacted me, purporting to mediate our
divorce impartially, yet his subsequent actions—advising Morgan, facilitating a transfer
of funds from our account to his PayPal, and overdrawn our joint account—belied his
stated intentions. This financial maneuvering, coupled with Dan's claim that Morgan is
"his client," despite lacking a legal license in Texas, underscores a deceitful
manipulation of the facts.
Morgan's subsequent visit to Dan's in Oklahoma for the divorce petition preparation
and the acquisition of a second phone coincided with a conspicuous halt in her
communications with Debbie, Dan, and Damen, as evidenced in the AT&T records.
On December 17th, 2023, I was served an eviction notice by Morgan's grandmother—a
notice that cited a divorce and a protective order not yet filed, revealing a preconceived
strategy to undermine my paternal rights and disrupt our daughters' stability,
particularly before the Christmas season.
The subsequent protective order filed on December 22nd, 2023, and the divorce
petition,

paint a unilateral narrative of events. Throughout this ordeal, Morgan has actively
excluded me from our daughters' lives and neglected to pursue employment or engage
in any dialogue regarding their future.
Conversely, I have remained steadfast in my parental duties, inviting Morgan to
participate in our daughters' lives, only to be rebuffed at every turn. Her behavior and
legal actions, which starkly contradict her claims of fear, suggest an attempt to evade
accountability rather than protect herself from any purported threat.
The chain of events illustrates a concerted effort by Morgan and her family to extricate
me from our home, leveraging unfounded legal allegations and an eviction suit without
considering the facts or the impact on our daughters.
It is my firm belief that Morgan's actions are self-serving, aimed at avoiding
responsibility for her actions rather than safeguarding our children. Hence, I implore
this court to recognize the inconsistencies in Morgan's claims and to view subsequent
allegations with a discerning eye, considering their strategic nature.
In conclusion, I respectfully request the court to deny the protective order and impose
sanctions on Dan Branthoover for his role in the marital discord that has ensued since
the announcement. It is essential for our daughters' stability and well-being that the full
truth of this matter be brought to light and considered in these proceedings.

7. On December 16th, 2023, Petitioner’s transaction under the advice of Mr. Branthoover
lead to our joint bank account becoming $-800 overdrawn. I requested from Mr.
Branthoover via text message that he needs to return the funds immediately, where he
subsequently admits to this transaction having occurred.⁶
8. On December 17th, 2023, Petitioner’s grandmother, Margie Wilson, initiates an Eviction
Suit by serving me an eviction notice around 11:00 AM CST.
9. On December 18th, 2023 – Petitioner writes “VOID” on the Eviction Notice, and
physically tears it in half. ⁷
10. On December 19th, 2023, Mr. Branthoover uses intimidation tactics by impersonating an
attorney despite having no license to practice law in the State of Texas.⁸
11. On December 27th, 2023, I am served the Divorce Papers by the Constable.
12. On December 28th, 2023, I am served the Protective Order, followed by the Eviction
shortly thereafter by the Constable.
The Protective Order (Show Cause) hearing was set for January 16th, 2024, and the Eviction 
hearing for January 17th, 2024. 
The documented timeline of events, particularly during the holiday season, underscores a 
notable disregard for our children's welfare. This has enabled the Petitioner to inappropriately 
utilize the judicial system to disrupt the stable environment our children have known, 
influenced significantly by third-party actions as previously detailed. The forthcoming section of 
this motion will highlight the specific frivolous claims and false statements found within each 
filing initiated by the Petitioner. 
⁶ See attached EXHIBIT A.4 – Overdrawn account notice from PNC bank on December 16th, 2023.
⁷ See attached EXHIBIT A.5 – The physically torn and voided Eviction notice served on December 17th, 2023.

7. On December 16, 2023, Petitioner’s transaction under the advice of Mr. Branthoover
lead to our joint bank account becoming $-800 overdrawn. I requested from Mr.
Branthoover via text message that he needs to return the funds immediately, where he
subsequently admits to this transaction having occurred.§

8. On December 17", 2023, Petitioner’s grandmother, Margie Wilson, initiates an Eviction
Suit by serving me an eviction notice around 11:00 AM CST.

9. On December 18", 2023 — Petitioner writes “VOID” on the Eviction Notice, and
physically tears it in half. 7

10.On December 19", 2023, Mr. Branthoover uses intimidation tactics by impersonating an
attorney despite having no license to practice law in the State of Texas.®

11.On December 27", 2023, I am served the Divorce Papers by the Constable.

12.On December 28", 2023, I am served the Protective Order, followed by the Eviction
shortly thereafter by the Constable.

The Protective Order (Show Cause) hearing was set for January 16", 2024, and the Eviction
hearing for January 17", 2024.

The documented timeline of events, particularly during the holiday season, underscores a
notable disregard for our children's welfare. This has enabled the Petitioner to inappropriately
utilize the judicial system to disrupt the stable environment our children have known,
influenced significantly by third-party actions as previously detailed. The forthcoming section of

this motion will highlight the specific frivolous claims and false statements found within each
filing initiated by the Petitioner.

® See attached EXHIBIT A.4 — Overdrawn account notice from PNC bank on December 16", 2023.
7 See attached EXHIBIT A.5 — The physically torn and voided Eviction notice served on December 17", 2023.

FRIVOLOUS CLAIMS AND FALSE STATEMENTS
A. EMERGENCY PROTECTIVE ORDER
1. As mentioned above, Petitioner filed for an Emergency Protective Order on
December 14th, 2023. This protective order was denied by the courts. 
2. Due to the fact this order was not granted by the court, one could conclude that
there was not a clear and present danger of family violence.¹ 
B. THE DIVORCE PETITION
1. Petition was filed on 2024-12-18 under an Affidavit of Inability to pay.²
2. The Petitioner's action of filing for divorce under an Affidavit of Inability to pay
three days after transferring $1,576 to herself starkly contravenes the mandates 
set forth in Chapter 10, Section 10.001 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code. This 
section asserts that each claim or legal contention must be warranted by existing 
law or a nonfrivolous argument for the modification of existing law or the 
establishment of new law, and that each factual contention has or is likely to have 
evidentiary support after further investigation or discovery³. 
3. The Petitioner violated Chapter 10, Section 10.001 a second time within the
same document when she intentionally elected to waive the 60-day waiting 
period claiming to have an active protective order against me that found family 
violence had occurred during our marriage⁴ despite being denied such an order
just five days prior on December 14th, 2023.  
5. The final page of the Divorce Petition for service to the Office of the Attorney
General was left unsigned by the Petitioner.

C. EVICTION SUIT
1. The suit was unlawful by nature⁵, as the grounds for eviction were based on
family status, referencing the divorce as well as a protective order that had been 
denied on December 14th, 2023. The suit was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction on 
January 17th, 2024.⁶ 
D. PROTECTIVE ORDER
1. This suit was the second attempt by the Petitioner to have me removed from
the home, which ultimately succeeded. 
2. The claims within this suit mentioned sexually aggressive comments and
threatening behavior. These allegations are materially false, as the Petitioner 
possesses no evidence, and has presented no evidence in relation to these claims 
since the initiation of the suit. Despite this, as video and image evidence will show 
once a fair trial date is set, the Petitioner and I continued to maintain stability at 
our family home and preserved the sense of normalcy that our daughters have 
been accustomed to their entire lives up until January 16th, 2024. 
The Court's decision to remove me from my home and my children’s lives on January 
16th, 2024, albeit preliminary and unjustified, bypassed the safeguarding of the children's 
emotional, psychological, and physical well-being. This oversight is compounded by the 
Petitioner's actions. The juxtaposition of the Court's decision against the backdrop of the 
Petitioner's inattention to the children's needs illuminates a disconcerting disregard for the 
paramount principle that custody determinations should primarily serve the children's best 
interests. The final section of this motion will highlight the procedural aspects of the events 
unfolding between the dates of January 16th, 2024, and February 1st, 2024, and pray the court 
will rectify this situation by restoring the stability to our family by vacating the current 
temporary orders that are in place until a proper investigation can be completed by the courts.

THE PROTECTIVE ORDER HEARINGS 
1. In preparation for the Protective Order hearing on January 16th, 2024, I filed with the
Court an answer to the Protective Order on January 2nd, 2024 as well as two motions – a
motion to consolidate the divorce with the protective order, filed on January 4th, 2024, as
well as a motion of continuance, filed on January 8th, 2024 for the purpose to acquire
counsel due to the complex nature of the case.¹ All three filings were accepted by the
court.
2. On January 16th, 2024, both parties sought additional time to secure legal
representation. Despite not reviewing any evidence, witness testimonies, or documents
related to the motions, and acknowledging the denial of a previous Emergency Protective
Order, the court mandated my departure from our home within four hours. This
decision, unexpectedly made, awarded custody to the Petitioner, overlooking my
concerns about the adverse effects on our children and my work from home. This ruling,
which both parties did not sign, set the case to resume on January 22nd, 2024, to allow
time for obtaining counsel.²
3. Following the court's directive, I relocated to my father's residence in Flower Mound until
the subsequent hearing. During this interval, the Petitioner did not take the initiative to
have the children call once and did not provide any information as to how they were
doing, showcasing her lack of empathy and concern for our children’s well-being and
stability. After incurring substantial expenses to secure representation, I detailed my case
and concerns to my attorney, preparing for the next court appearance.
4. On January 22nd, 2024, the Petitioner chose to seek legal representation just minutes
before the hearing was due to start, indicating a disregard for the process. My lawyer
recommended agreeing to a continuance, thereby extending the period I couldn't work
and impacting our established family dynamics. This resulted in a third hearing being set
for February 1st, coinciding with my birthday, and a second rendition being ordered.³

5. On February 1st, 2024, during the third hearing, the substantive issues I had raised were
not addressed, nor was there any exchange of evidence between our legal representatives. 
Despite the focus of the hearing supposed to be on the protective order, the discussions 
veered into custody and child support matters. My lawyer presented the sole option of a 
temporary return to the family home for 30 days with expanded visitation rights, coupled 
with a child support obligation starting in April. This outcome, which diverged significantly 
from the case's core issues, compelled me to reconsider my legal representation. 
Consequently, I decided to terminate my attorney's services and embarked on drafting this 
motion myself, aiming to bring the court's attention back to the pivotal elements of the case 
that had thus far been neglected while able to legally reside in my home. 
CONCLUSION AND PRAYER 
In conclusion, this motion has laid bare the stark realities and procedural aberrations that have 
marred the essence of justice and due process in the matter of Cause No. 322-744263-23. 
Through the course of these proceedings, it has become abundantly clear that the actions taken 
by the Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, have not only disregarded the welfare and best 
interests of our children but have also illuminated her unfitness as a parent. Her actions speak 
to a pattern of deceit, manipulation, and an unsettling willingness to leverage the judicial 
system for personal vendettas, all at the expense of the emotional and psychological well-being 
of our children. 
The court, in its decisions, inadvertently facilitated this troubling trajectory by removing me, 
Charles Dustin Myers, from the lives of our children based on unsubstantiated claims and 
without due consideration of my role as a devoted and stable parent. This oversight has not 
only disrupted the lives of our children but has also significantly impaired my ability to provide 
for them, casting a long shadow over their future stability and welfare. 
Moreover, the conduct of my Counsel involved has further compounded these issues, 
demonstrating a distressing disregard for the intricate dynamics and facts of this case. This has 
culminated in a situation where the paramount importance of the children's best interests and 
the fundamental principles of fairness and justice have been overshadowed by procedural 
missteps and a lack of thorough investigation into the Petitioner's fitness as a parent.

Therefore, it is with a heavy hearted yet unwavering resolve that I implore the Court to take 
immediate and decisive action to rectify these wrongs. Specifically, I respectfully request the 
Court to: 
1. Vacate the existing temporary orders that unjustly removed me from my home and
separated me from my children, restoring the status quo ante until a thorough and
unbiased evaluation of the facts can be conducted, as the Texas Constitution requires. If
left as it stands, these orders will further compound the issues at hand, and will
exacerbate the chaos introduced into the children’s lives.
2. Set a fair hearing date to delve into the substantive issues at hand, ensuring that all
parties are given an equitable opportunity to present their case and that the best
interests of our children are placed at the forefront of all considerations.
3. Scrutinize any response or new claims from the Petitioner or her counsel with the utmost
diligence, given the established pattern of deceitful and manipulative behavior exhibited
by the Petitioner throughout these proceedings.
4. Consider awarding me full custody of our children, ensuring their continued access to a
stable, nurturing environment, and the consistent provision of their needs, which I am
fully committed to upholding. Furthermore, in alignment with my enduring belief in the
importance of both parents in the lives of our children, I pledge to facilitate and
encourage a healthy, constructive relationship between the children and their mother,
provided she demonstrates a genuine commitment to their well-being and stability.
5. In seeking these remedies, I do so not out of vindictiveness but from a place of deep
concern for the welfare of our children and a steadfast belief in the principles of justice
and fairness. Despite the pain and turmoil of these proceedings, my ultimate desire is for
peace and the best possible outcome for all parties involved, most importantly, our
children. It is my sincere hope that the Court will recognize the gravity of the situation

to a life marked by stability and love.

STATE OF TEXAS 
Morgan Michelle Myers, 
Cause No. 322-744263-23 
Petitioner, 
v. 
RESPONDENT’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL 
SUMMARY JUDGEMENT 
Charles Dustin Myers, 
Respondent 
Pursuant to Rule 166a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure¹, the Respondent, Charles 
Dustin Myers, firmly seeks a partial Summary Judgment in regard to the upcoming 
hearing scheduled for March 14th, 2024. He categorically asserts that the evidence on file 
with the Court definitively demonstrates there is no genuine issue as to any material fact 
related to the allegations against him which have led to his unwarranted removal from 
his home, significantly disrupted his business operations, and unjustly granted the 
Petitioner full custody of their children and possession of the family home on a 
temporary basis. 
The Respondent has meticulously and persistently contested the baseless allegations of 
family violence that have unjustly prejudiced the custody resolution to the detriment of 
the children's interests. The absence of substantive evidence supporting these claims has 
been made clear through detailed submissions.²  This unwarranted influence on custody 
¹ Rule 166a specifically allows for summary judgment when "the pleadings, depositions, answers to 
interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine 
issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." This 
provision is utilized here to highlight the lack of factual dispute regarding the allegations of family 
violence which have led to the continuation of unlawful temporary orders currently in place. 
² Submissions on record filed by the Respondent: Motion of Continuance (granted), Motion of 
Consolidation (granted), Protective Order Answer (ignored), Counter Petition for Divorce (ignored), 
Motion of Withdrawal for Attorney (granted), Emergency Motion of Reconsideration of Evidence and to 
Vacate Temporary Orders (Scheduled for March 14th, 2024). See attached EXHIBIT A.

Petitioner,

RESPONDENT’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL

SUMMARY JUDGEMENT
Charles Dustin Myers,

Respondent

Pursuant to Rule 166a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure!, the Respondent, Charles
Dustin Myers, firmly seeks a partial Summary Judgment in regard to the upcoming
hearing scheduled for March 14", 2024. He categorically asserts that the evidence on file
with the Court definitively demonstrates there is no genuine issue as to any material fact
related to the allegations against him which have led to his unwarranted removal from
his home, significantly disrupted his business operations, and unjustly granted the
Petitioner full custody of their children and possession of the family home on a
temporary basis.

The Respondent has meticulously and persistently contested the baseless allegations of

family violence that have unjustly prejudiced the custody resolution to the detriment of
the children's interests. The absence of substantive evidence supporting these claims has
been made clear through detailed submissions.2 This unwarranted influence on custody

1 Rule 166a specifically allows for summary judgment when "the pleadings, depositions, answers to
interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine
issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." This
provision is utilized here to highlight the lack of factual dispute regarding the allegations of family
violence which have led to the continuation of unlawful temporary orders currently in place.

2 Submissions on record filed by the Respondent: Motion of Continuance (granted), Motion of
Consolidation (granted), Protective Order Answer (ignored), Counter Petition for Divorce (ignored),
Motion of Withdrawal for Attorney (granted), Emergency Motion of Reconsideration of Evidence and to
Vacate Temporary Orders (Scheduled for March 14", 2024). See attached EXHIBIT A.

arrangements negate the principles of fairness and due process. The subsequent 
dismissal of the Protective Order suit not only vindicates the Respondent but also 
invalidates the current custody orders, revealing that the initial award of custody was 
grounded solely in unsubstantiated claims of family violence.³
BACKGROUND 
The documents on record filed by the Respondent, by virtue of their acceptance, 
inherently meet the threshold for self-authentication, thereby bolstering the legal 
foundation for the requested partial Summary Judgment. Detailed herewith are the 
enumerated facts underpinning this motion:
1. On December 14th, 2023, the Petitioner sought an EX-PARTE Order of
Protection from the Court, which was judiciously denied, affirming the
absence of immediate threat or harm that warranted such an extraordinary
measure. Undeterred by this judicial determination, the Petitioner proceeded
to file for divorce on December 18th, 2023, misleadingly alleging the existence
of an active Order of Protection against the Respondent. This deliberate
misrepresentation constitutes not merely an attempt to skew the legal process
in the Petitioner’s favor but represents a flagrant abuse of the judicial system
designed to secure an undue advantage in the divorce proceedings, which has
ultimately been successful.
2. On December 22nd, 2023, the Petitioner initiated a subsequent application for
a Protective Order, forming the cornerstone of litigation since the initial
hearing on January 16th, 2024.
3. On January 16th, 2024, the Court rendered Temporary Orders which required
the Respondent to vacate his family home and give up custody of his children
on the presumption of family violence. The Court’s decision did not meet the
statutory requirements of the Texas Family Code, Sec. 6.502.⁴
³ The non-suit of the protective order entitles the Respondent to this Partial Summary Judgement as a 
matter of law, as there is now no genuine dispute over the baselessness of the allegations made against 
him which are the foundation of the current temporary orders in place. 
⁴ Sec. 6.502 mandates that a Court may make such a decision while a suit for dissolution of a marriage is
pending and on the motion of a party or on the court's own motion after notice and hearing. No hearing 
took place, and no reasonable notice was given prior to the decision rendered on January 16th, 2024.

acquired legal counsel at the last minute, delaying the case further until the
reset date of February 1st, 2024.
5. On February 1st, 2024, both parties entered into an agreement which allowed
the respondent back into the home on a temporary basis, yet still awarded the
Petitioner with full custody of the children. The Respondent was given 30 days
per the agreement to remain in the home. Despite having the ability to stay
next door, and after dropping the Protective Suit that initiated and are the
foundation for this agreement, the Petitioner chose to stay with her friend 9
miles away and remove the children from their stable environment.
6. On February 5th, 2024, the Respondent discharged his Legal Counsel for failure
to address any of the issues mentioned herewith, and for failure to diligently
represent the Respondent, as no genuine effort was made to make the court
aware of these errors. The Protective Order suit was non-suited on this day,
invalidating the current agreement, and requiring by law that the Court reset
the case back to the status quo ante until a fair discovery process can be
conducted on relevant matters to the divorce proceeding, and restoring order
back into the lives of the Respondent and his Children.
7. The Petitioner's decision to reside outside the family home, despite alternatives
that would minimize disruption during this transitional period, is a deliberate
choice. This choice, made independently, should not facilitate the continuation
of unfounded claims that have since been dismissed. Such actions have unduly
influenced the living arrangements and well-being of the children at the heart
of this case.
8. The Respondent explicitly refrains from pursuing any sanctions or penalties
against the Petitioner, emphasizing instead a heartfelt plea for a reasonable
transition period. This adjustment period is advocated as crucial for
safeguarding the welfare of his children, himself, and the Petitioner, ensuring
their collective long-term well-being. Furthermore, the Respondent
underscores that the prevailing custody determinations were unjustly
predicated on unsubstantiated allegations of family violence—a point
underscored by the unequivocal dismissal of the Protective Order, which
confirms the absence of any contested material facts.

LEGAL BASIS 
The legal foundation for this Partial Summary Judgment is firmly rooted in the principles 
and mandates of the law, notably where the current temporary orders are predicated on 
unsubstantiated claims of family violence, for which no concrete evidence has been 
presented. This lack of evidence fundamentally challenges the integrity and validity of 
the orders affecting the lives and welfare of the children involved. The necessity for the 
court to vacate these orders and revert to the status quo ante is underscored by the 
following critical legal arguments: 
1 . Misalignment with Texas Family Code Sec. 105.001: 
1.1 The orders issued on January 16th, 2024, and continued on January 
22nd, 2024, starkly conflict with Texas Family Code Sec. 105.001, which 
unequivocally necessitates notice and a hearing prior to the issuance of 
such orders. This statute ensures that parties are given a fair opportunity to 
be heard, a fundamental aspect of due process, which was conspicuously 
absent in this case. 
2. Contravention of Texas Family Code Sec. 105.005:
2.1 The initial rendering of temporary orders on January 16th, 2024, did 
not adhere to Texas Family Code Sec. 105.005, requiring that court's 
findings be grounded in a preponderance of the evidence before making 
any child custody determination affecting the parent-child relationship. 
2.2 The absence of evidence from the Petitioner, juxtaposed with the 
disregard for the Respondent's timely submissions, underscores a 
significant deviation from this legal requirement. 
3. Violation of Texas Family Code Sec. 153.002:
3.1 The proceedings failed to prioritize "The best interest of the child," as 
mandated by Texas Family Code Sec. 153.002. This principle, deemed 
paramount in determining issues of conservatorship, possession, and 
access, was overlooked.

mandated by Texas Family Code Sec. 153.002. This principle, deemed
paramount in determining issues of conservatorship, possession, and
access, was overlooked.

3.2 The Respondent's work-from-home situation and the need for a

reasonable transition period to maintain his pivotal role in his children’s 
lives were disregarded, further exacerbating the impact of the Petitioner’s 
actions and the court’s decisions on the children’s stability and well-being. 
4. Equal Opportunity and Fair Hearing (Sec. 152.205 & Sec. 105.003):
4.1 The Texas Family Code Sec. 152.205 and Sec. 105.003 enshrine the 
necessity for equitable procedural rights, mandating that all parties are 
granted a fair opportunity for notification and a meaningful hearing. The 
Respondent’s ability to engage fully in the hearing process and to present a 
comprehensive defense was significantly impeded, a deviation from the 
due process envisaged by these statutes. Consequently, the temporary 
orders issued lack the foundational fairness that is central to the justice 
system and contravene the legal safeguards intended to ensure balanced 
participation by all parties in family law proceedings. 
5. Managing Conservatorship Considerations (Sec. 153.005 & Sec. 153.007):
5.1 In deliberations of conservatorship, Texas Family Code Sec. 153.005 
obligates the court to deliberate thoroughly on the child’s best interest, 
including the living circumstances and stability provided by the parents. 
Additionally, Sec. 153.007 advocates for the establishment of a mutually 
agreed parenting plan, prioritizing the child’s welfare and the continuity of 
their established routine. The current custodial provisions do not 
correspond with a collaboratively designed parenting plan that satisfies 
these essential criteria. Given the disproven allegations of family violence 
and the unnecessary protective measures imposed during this period of 
change, it is imperative for the Court to rescind these provisional measures. 
The immediate restoration of the status quo ante is crucial to uphold the 
children’s best interest, allowing for a planned and considerate period of 
adjustment that acknowledges the absence of any immediate risk or harm 
to their well-being and without disruption to the Respondent’s business 
operations at-home.

STATEMENTS OF FACT 
Below are the enumerated statements of fact with no genuine dispute of material fact 
that entitle the Respondent to this Partial Summary Judgement: 
1. The Petitioner has not provided any evidence of Family Violence.⁶ These claims
unjustly removed the Respondent from his home starting on January 16th, 2024
and significantly impaired his at-home business operations, and are the basis for
the current custodial arrangements which are unlawful and founded on false
claims.⁷
2. No basis exists for the current arrangements, as the Court has not considered the
best interests of the children throughout this case, but rather has operated solely
on the accusations of family violence, which are now non-suited.⁸
3. The deadline approaching March 1st to vacate, and the current custodial
arrangements are void of any lawful basis. Any custodial arrangements are
required to consider the best interests of the children involved.
4. Respondent’s parenting plan has been overlooked by the Court, filed January 6th,
2024.⁹
5. The Court’s basis for conservatorship was based solely on the claims of Family
Violence, which are now void.
6. The respondent is entitled to this Partial Summary Judgement as a matter of law,
which will rightfully restore the status quo ante given no genuine dispute of
material fact exists regarding family violence, which are the basis for the ongoing
and current orders.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Charles Dustin Myers, the Respondent herein, respectfully requests this 
Honorable Court to: 
1. Annul the current temporary custody and visitation arrangements premised on
allegations now proven to be baseless, taking into account the critical urgency
imposed by the Respondent’s work-from-home requirements and the ongoing
detriment to his familial relationships.
2. Recognize that the initial accusations of family violence, which underpinned
the imposition of these temporary measures, were not substantiated by
credible evidence. This failure has unjustly prejudiced the Respondent,
undermining his right to an equitable adjudication and rendering the imposed
measures legally untenable.
3. Acknowledge the absence of substantial evidence for the allegations levied
against the Respondent. Command a thorough reevaluation of both procedural
and substantive legal missteps observed in the prevailing proceedings, with a
view to rectifying the inequitable temporary orders that have adversely
impacted the Respondent’s familial and professional life.
4.
In accordance with Rule 166a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule
60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, award relief predicated on
identifiable mistakes, errors, and the conspicuous lack of evidential foundation
for the accusations faced by the Respondent.
5. Uphold Fairness and Due Process: Reorient the ongoing legal process to align
strictly with the principles of fairness, due process, and the paramount
interests of the children involved. This reorientation is essential to ensure the
administration of justice, uphold the Respondent’s inalienable right to a fair
trial, and ameliorate the unwarranted disruptions to his familial life.

EXHIBIT A: TEMPORARY VISITATION ADJUSTMENT PROPOSAL

Respondent: Charles Dustin Myers

Understanding the intricate nature of our family's current situation and the legal complexities involved, |,
Charles Dustin Myers, propose a thoughtful adjustment to the visitation schedule that aligns with our
cohabiting status and the abrupt changes brought about by the divorce announcement.

1. Co-habitation Acknowledgement:

It is acknowledged that both parents currently cohabit, which com plicates traditional custody
arrangements. Therefore, the immediate priority is to facilitate a transition where both parties can
establish their respective independent living and working arrangements without disrupting the children's
lives.

2. Transition Period:

Morgan's Employment: Provide Morgan with the necessary support and time to secure stable
employment, which is vital for her to contribute to the children's needs and establish her own residence.

Stable Housing for Charles: As | seek stable housing to maintain my significant role in our daughters'
lives, flexibility in visitation is essential to ensure | continue to fulfill my parental duties.

3. Work and Research Commitments:

The concurrent legal proceedings, particularly those based on unverified clai ms, demand a substantial
amount of my time for research and preparation to protect the children's wel l-being.

My ability to work has been affected by the proceedings, necessitating an adjustment in my day-to-day
routine to accommodate these new responsibilities.

4. Interim Custody Logic:

Continuity for Children: While we navigate these proceedings, it is critical to maintain stability and
continuity for our children. Any temporary custody arrangements should reflect the least disruptive path
for them.

Counseling and Mediation: | strongly advocate for counseling or mediation to reconcile and navigate the
divorce process, emphasizing the children's best interests rather than abrupt and contentious changes.

5. Court's Facilitation:

The court's facilitation in endorsing a temporary and flexible visitation framework is crucial. This
framework must account for the current living situation and the significant emotional and logistical
upheaval that the divorce proceedings have caused.

This proposal is made in the spirit of cooperation, with a focus on minimizing the impact of our marital
dissolution on our children. It is with a sincere hope that we can transition into a stable co-parenting
arrangement that keeps our children's welfare as the priority.

Petitioner, 
v. 
NOTICE AND UNSWORN DECLARATION 
Charles Dustin Myers, 
Respondent 
March 3, 2024 
Dear Clerk of the Court, 
This letter is submitted on behalf of the Respondent in the above-referenced case to 
provide the court with an update on the Respondent's efforts to uphold the well-being of 
the children under the current agreed arrangements pending review and to navigate the 
complexities of this case. The following reasons why it is impossible for the Respondent 
to vacate the family home under the current agreement pending review are as follows: 
1. Since the inception of the case, the Respondent's primary focus has been to reset
the status quo ante for the benefit of the children, ensuring their lives remain as
normal and uninterrupted as possible during this transitory period after it was
significantly disrupted beginning on January 16th, 2024. Despite the challenges
posed by the non-suited protective order and the dropped allegations of family
violence which were the foundations of all decisions made within this case, the
Respondent has respected the orders pending review, and has strived to provide a
stable and supportive environment for his children during his designated time, all
while planning a transition that best suits his children.
2. During the short amount of time the Respondent has been re-instated to his home,
the Petitioner has, on multiple occasions, entered the residence unannounced and
without prior consent, actions which stand in stark contrast to her prior requests
for protection which have governed this case.

3. The Petitioner has changed employers since the signing of the agreement.
4. Petitioner has relinquished custody of the children to the Respondent on multiple
days during her scheduled time, showcasing the Respondent’s ability to care for
his children at any time given his at-home work schedule specifically crafted to
ensure participation in every aspect of his children’s lives remains possible.
5. The Respondent must dedicate substantial time to researching and understanding
legal procedures to ensure compliance with court rules and to advocate effectively
for the best interests of his children. He is prepared to present all relevant facts
and evidence at the upcoming hearing on March 14th, should his partial summary
judgment not be accepted.

EMPLOYMENT HISTORY AND FAMILY DYNAMICS 
1. Throughout their marriage, both parents have alternated roles as stay-at-
home parents, adapting their employment status to meet the 
developmental needs and schedules of their children, now aged seven and 
five. This arrangement has enabled both the Petitioner and Respondent to 
maintain an active and consistent presence in their children’s lives, 
encompassing not only day-to-day care but also engagement in school 
activities and extracurricular events. This hands-on approach has been a 
testament to their dedication to the well-being and upbringing of their 
children, demonstrating a flexible yet committed stance towards 
balancing family responsibilities with personal and professional 
development opportunities as they arise. 
2. The Couple had lived paycheck to paycheck for most of the marriage, and
things began to look up when the Petitioner acquired a job as a Leasing 
Agent/Consultant near our home. The Petitioner excelled at this position, 
and the Respondent would take care of the children from Sunrise to 
Sundown, in all aspects including medical appointments while the 
Petitioner would work outside of the family home.

become the sales solution for the dealership during the COVID-19 
pandemic. 
8. In November of 2019, the Respondent created a YouTube channel
entitled Charlie and the Mazdas, where he began to use his self-
certification for internet sales to create personalized videos for internet 
clients during the pandemic, allowing them to see the features of their 
desired vehicle from the comfort of their own home. If the client decided 
to move forward, the Respondent would wrap the steering wheels in 
plastic wrap, wash the vehicles himself, and drive them to the client’s 
residence as a courtesy service during the pandemic. 
9. This approach was not only successful but lead to the Respondent
finishing second overall for the Southwest Region of the United States for 
Mazda sales for the year of 2020. 
10. The Couple also leased their first vehicle in November of 2019, which was
a Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring model, machine grey. 
11. As the year 2020 unfolded, the Respondent found himself increasingly
drawn to the stock market. This interest was sparked by the extraordinary 
market conditions of 2020, fueled by the Federal Reserve’s pivotal 
amendments to Regulation D and the Supplemental Leverage Ratio. 
These changes were instrumental in maintaining bank liquidity, enabling 
continued lending to high-risk companies amid the pandemic, presenting 
unique investment opportunities.

become the sales solution for the dealership during the COVID-19

pandemic.

8. In November of 2019, the Respondent created a YouTube channel
entitled Charlie and the Mazdas, where he began to use his self-
certification for internet sales to create personalized videos for internet
clients during the pandemic, allowing them to see the features of their
desired vehicle from the comfort of their own home. If the client decided
to move forward, the Respondent would wrap the steering wheels in
plastic wrap, wash the vehicles himself, and drive them to the client’s

residence as a courtesy service during the pandemic.

9. This approach was not only successful but lead to the Respondent
finishing second overall for the Southwest Region of the United States for

Mazda sales for the year of 2020.

10. The Couple also leased their first vehicle in November of 2019, which was

a Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring model, machine grey.

11.As the year 2020 unfolded, the Respondent found himself increasingly

drawn to the stock market. This interest was sparked by the extraordinary

market conditions of 2020, fueled by the Federal Reserve’s pivotal

amendments to Regulation D and the Supplemental Leverage Ratio.

These changes were instrumental in maintaining bank liquidity, enabling

continued lending to high-risk companies amid the pandemic, presenting

unique investment opportunities.

12. By January 2021, inspired by his burgeoning passion for financial
markets—and motivated by a desire to reclaim precious time with the 
Children—the Respondent made a conscientious decision to part ways 
with the dealership. This step was taken in good faith, driven by his 
commitment to both his family and his growing interest in financial 
markets, setting the stage for a new chapter in his professional and 
personal life since his employment began on July 1st, 2019. 
13. Shortly after starting this new chapter, the Respondent quickly realized
trading was going to be a lot more challenging than he had first realized, 
which lead to the evolution of his YouTube channel, renamed from 
Charlie and the Mazdas to Charlie’s Vids, where he turned his focus to 
SEC law, covering agency filings out of the Options Clearing Corporation, 
National Securities Clearing Corporation, Depository Trust Company, 
Depository Trust Clearing Corporation, FINRA, the Code of Federal 
Regulations, the Office of Financial Research, amongst other market 
agencies. 
14. The Respondent would cover the filings, accompanied by PowerPoint
presentations for the viewer, which quickly became well-received, 
garnering the Respondent over 30,000 subscribers by May of 2021.

__________________________________________________ 
To prioritize the children’s well-being and uphold the existing familial structure, 
while actively promoting a healthy and ongoing relationship between the children 
and both parents. This commitment is rooted in the understanding that the 
continued involvement of both parents in the children’s daily lives is not only 
beneficial but essential for their emotional and psychological development. The 
Respondent seeks to ensure that the children’s interests are placed at the forefront of 
all decisions, advocating for a stable and nurturing environment that supports their 
growth and well-being, which is not the current environment.

THE RESPONDENT’S EFFORTS 
1. Due to having failed legal representation, the resources required to
acquire alternative Counsel after the termination of Mr. Bacalis coupled
with the growing dis-trust of the Judicial System as a whole given the
totality of circumstances left the Respondent with having to represent
himself, which is a task he has taken seriously in an effort to advocate for
his daughters in a zealous manner.
2. The Respondent has researched and is aware of the ever-growing burden
pro-se litigants are becoming on the Courts, their staff, and their
resources due to the vast majority of pro-se litigants not putting in the
time or effort reasonably required to represent themselves effectively or
are solely trying to reduce costs associated with their case, both leading to
increased case lengths and litigation costs.
3. The Respondent in this case stands out from the stereotype as follows:

However, since December 2023, there has been a notable decline in the
reliability and efficiency of the service provided. This shift coincides with Mr.
Myers facing significant personal and legal challenges, including a divorce
proceeding that has drastically impacted his ability to operate his business
effectively. A particularly distressing development for Mr. Myers has been his
inability to access the physical location where his business equipment and
data connections are housed. This situation has not only disrupted the service
but has also imposed significant financial difficulties on Mr. Myers, threatening
the sustainability of the business and the quality of service that customers
have come to expect.

The repercussions of these challenges have been felt deeply by both Mr.
Myers and his clientele. While the community understands and sympathizes
with Mr. Myers’ personal struggles, the increasing service disruptions have
raised concerns among users about the future reliability and viability of the
service. We are hopeful for a resolution that will allow Mr. Myers to regain
access to his business infrastructure, thereby restoring the service quality and
reliability that we have valued highly. It is in the interest of both Mr. Myers and
his customers to find a solution that addresses these operational challenges
while supporting him through his personal difficulties, ensuring the long-term
success and sustainability of the service.

I subscribed for an extensive education program under Charles Myers to gain expertise in

reading and researching market data. Charles Myers, a dedicated father, teacher, and
mentor, has been instrumental in inspiring myself and numerous others to independently

pursue knowledge in the field of financial data. The instability in Charles Myers' living
situation has adversely affected his ability to fulfill his work commitments to the best of

his capacity. This instability has had a significant impact on my ability to efficiently learn

and absorb the subject matter, as Charles Myers is unable to work full time from his

home office. Charles Myers requires a meticulously crafted computer setup to efficiently

manage and process extensive data sets and resource-intensive programs essential for his

work in market research and education. The consequence of Charles Myers' restricted

My name is Nicholas Glen Morvan ;
| am of sound mind and capable of making this statement. | have personal knowledge of
the facts written in this statement. | understand that if | lie in this statement, | may be held

criminally responsible. This statement is true and correct.

| am a paying customer of Charles Myers for the past two years and four months. In this time, he has been

working exclusively out of his home office to run his business, and provide for his family.
Charles has worked very hard for the past two years to provide a quality experience that benefits
all of his customers. His ability to provide these services have been directly impacted by his inability to

access his home office. As a result, my experience as a customer has suffered, and | am not receiving

the level of service that | have been paying for. | understand that there are unfortunate circumstances

and | am patient while Charles resolves his situation. He has been incredibly apologetic that he cannot

provide the same level of quality, and uninterrupted service due to his inability to work out of his home

office. | do not question his integrity with regards to this situation, he has always been honest and upfront

with myself and others. My hope is that he may return to his home office in order to avoid shutting down

Christian Michael Vroom

| am of sound mind and capable of making this statement. | have personal knowledge of
the facts written in this statement. | understand that if | lie in this statement, | may be held

criminally responsible. This statement is true and correct.

I'm signing this affidavit to attest to the work ethic and
dedication of Charles Myers. I've come to rely on the
services he provides in order to gather the required data to
make educated decisions on what and when to enter/exit
options positions. Recently due to him not being at his
normal location of operations the services have had multiple
down times in which Charles was not in a position to be able
to remedy. Some of these down times have led to significant
losses due to making decisions without the necessary data
after already being entered in a position.

Charles' work ethic is unlike anything I've seen in anyone
ver met and h verything for the future of hi
family. I'm constantly amazed at the feats he is able to pull
off as a one man show. Some things he is able to create

| didn't think were possible but he figures it out through

his endless research and personal development efforts.
Again, everything I've seen him do, he does to give his

irls the best life he can and wants the world for them.
I've seen videos of him with his children out at man |
different parks/recreational areas and | can tell that the |

;

love their father to death and that he would die for them.
| hope his situation is resolved for not only my benefit but
for the sakes of his children and the life he is trying to

provide them with. Charles Myers is both a good person and

amazing father and | would hate to see him and his daughters
robbed of the life he is building that they need and deserve.
