ISSUES PRESENTED 
1. Given evidence suggesting that the Petitioner fabricated allegations of
family violence to secure a tactical advantage in custody and divorce
proceedings, does this raise a significant legal question regarding the
adequacy of safeguards against misuse of protective orders, potentially
warranting a review of the court’s reliance on unverified claims in making
preliminary decisions affecting parental rights and access to children?
2. Considering the absence of concrete evidence indicating an immediate
risk of harm or abuse towards the Petitioner or minor children, did the
Court’s initial decision to issue Temporary Orders on January 16th, 
followed by January 22nd, and February 1st—thereby excluding the 
Respondent from the family residence and severing his relationship with 
his children—constitute an abuse of discretion lacking clear evidence of 
danger for such emergency action, ultimately leading to a violation of the 
Respondent’s due process and infringement of constitutional and parental 
rights, while also disregarding the children’s best interests? 
3. How can the Court remove one parent from the home without following
the mandated process required by law, resulting in the destruction of the
status quo of the minor children, and further uphold this decision when
no finding of facts has taken place?

EMPLOYMENT HISTORY AND FAMILY DYNAMICS 
1. Throughout their marriage, both parents have alternated roles as stay-at-
home parents, adapting their employment status to meet the 
developmental needs and schedules of their children, now aged seven and 
five. This arrangement has enabled both the Petitioner and Respondent to 
maintain an active and consistent presence in their children’s lives, 
encompassing not only day-to-day care but also engagement in school 
activities and extracurricular events. This hands-on approach has been a 
testament to their dedication to the well-being and upbringing of their 
children, demonstrating a flexible yet committed stance towards 
balancing family responsibilities with personal and professional 
development opportunities as they arise. 
2. The Couple had lived paycheck to paycheck for most of the marriage, and
things began to look up when the Petitioner acquired a job as a Leasing 
Agent/Consultant near our home. The Petitioner excelled at this position, 
and the Respondent would take care of the children from Sunrise to

Petitioner would work outside of the family home.

pandemic. 
 
8. In November of 2019, the Respondent created a YouTube channel 
entitled Charlie and the Mazdas, where he began to use his self-
certification for internet sales to create personalized videos for internet 
clients during the pandemic, allowing them to see the features of their 
desired vehicle from the comfort of their own home. If the client decided 
to move forward, the Respondent would wrap the steering wheels in 
plastic wrap, wash the vehicles himself, and drive them to the client’s 
residence as a courtesy service during the pandemic. 
 
 
 
9. This approach was not only successful but lead to the Respondent 
finishing second overall for the Southwest Region of the United States for 
Mazda sales for the year of 2020. 
 
 
10. The Couple also leased their first vehicle in November of 2019, which was 
a Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring model, machine grey.  
 
 
11. As the year 2020 unfolded, the Respondent found himself increasingly 
drawn to the stock market. This interest was sparked by the extraordinary 
market conditions of 2020, fueled by the Federal Reserve’s pivotal 
amendments to Regulation D and the Supplemental Leverage Ratio. 
These changes were instrumental in maintaining bank liquidity, enabling 
continued lending to high-risk companies amid the pandemic, presenting

markets—and motivated by a desire to reclaim precious time with the 
Children—the Respondent made a conscientious decision to part ways 
with the dealership. This step was taken in good faith, driven by his 
commitment to both his family and his growing interest in financial 
markets, setting the stage for a new chapter in his professional and 
personal life since his employment began on July 1st, 2019. 
 
 
13. Shortly after starting this new chapter, the Respondent quickly realized 
trading was going to be a lot more challenging than he had first realized, 
which lead to the evolution of his YouTube channel, renamed from 
Charlie and the Mazdas to Charlie’s Vids, where he turned his focus to 
SEC law, covering agency filings out of the Options Clearing Corporation, 
National Securities Clearing Corporation, Depository Trust Company, 
Depository Trust Clearing Corporation, FINRA, the Code of Federal

amount of data, making cloud storage or hosting impractical for his needs

due to the costs associated with it.

23.Around this same time, the Petitioner acquired a part-time job in the City
of Watauga, where she would work primarily evenings and on Saturdays,

frequently visiting the residence of her friends after work.

24.From the end of July to mid-November 2023, the Respondent dedicated
himself to optimizing his setup. By November 24", 2023, he launched his
own web service from home, elevating his client offerings by integrating
marketing efforts directly with his services, setting a new benchmark for

his business model.

25. During the beginning of September, 2023, the Couple upgraded their

internet speed to meet the evolving demands of the at-home business.°

26. Throughout the rest of the months of September 2023 and November
2023, the Couple continued their daily routines, looking forward to the

upcoming holiday season with the Children.

6 Petitioner excited and aware of my needs for at-home work just 3 months prior to the Divorce

2. The Court has, perhaps unintentionally, endorsed the behavior
detailed in paragraph 1 by failing to thoroughly examine the case’s 
facts, despite their repeated emphasis throughout these 
proceedings. 
3. The opposing Counsel has not conducted any meaningful discovery
in this case to warrant any significant decisions which has 
ultimately damaged the future outlook of the children by awarding 
full custody to the Petitioner for no valid reason. The only 
discovery conducted in this case amounts to financial disclosures 
which have since significantly changed, as the Petitioner has

2. The Court has, perhaps unintentionally, endorsed the behavior

detailed in paragraph 1 by failing to thoroughly examine the case’s
facts, despite their repeated emphasis throughout these

proceedings.

The opposing Counsel has not conducted any meaningful discovery
in this case to warrant any significant decisions which has
ultimately damaged the future outlook of the children by awarding
full custody to the Petitioner for no valid reason. The only
discovery conducted in this case amounts to financial disclosures
which have since significantly changed, as the Petitioner has
changed employment, and the Respondent has been unable to

work to full capacity since March 6", 2024.

RESPONDENT’S PARENTAL INDEX 
The Respondent has had one objective throughout this case: 
__________________________________________________ 
To prioritize the children’s well-being and uphold the existing familial structure, 
while actively promoting a healthy and ongoing relationship between the children 
and both parents. This commitment is rooted in the understanding that the 
continued involvement of both parents in the children’s daily lives is not only 
beneficial but essential for their emotional and psychological development. The 
Respondent seeks to ensure that the children’s interests are placed at the forefront of 
all decisions, advocating for a stable and nurturing environment that supports their 
growth and well-being, which is not the current environment.

TIMELINE13

While the Petitioner spent the majority of her time between the dates of 
2023-12-01 and 2024-01-16 filing frivolous suits rather than considering 
the children’s best interests, the Respondent prioritized their holiday and 
school break while simultaneously combating concurrent lawsuits brought 
against him by the Petitioner and her family.

THE RESPONDENT’S EFFORTS 
1. Due to having failed legal representation, the resources required to
acquire alternative Counsel after the termination of Mr. Bacalis coupled
with the growing dis-trust of the Judicial System as a whole given the
totality of circumstances left the Respondent with having to represent
himself, which is a task he has taken seriously in an effort to advocate for
his daughters in a zealous manner.
2. The Respondent has researched and is aware of the ever-growing burden
pro-se litigants are becoming on the Courts, their staff, and their
resources due to the vast majority of pro-se litigants not putting in the
time or effort reasonably required to represent themselves effectively or
are solely trying to reduce costs associated with their case, both leading to
increased case lengths and litigation costs.
3. The Respondent in this case stands out from the stereotype as follows:
a. Since the removal of his home on January 16th, 2024, the Respondent

ARGUMENT 
I. Best Interests of the Children
1. In the case concerning the unjust removal of a father from his
residence on January 16, 2024, without prior notice, which abruptly 
ended his meaningful relationship with his daughters and significantly 
impacted his livelihood due to his home-based business operations, the 
Court notably failed to comply with the essential legal principles set forth 
in Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367 (Tex. 1976). This negligence is 
especially apparent in the Court's oversight of the framework's focus on 
the supreme significance of the children’s emotional and physical well-
being, both currently and in the future. 
2. The decision in Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367 (Tex. 1976),
emphasizes the importance of conducting a comprehensive analysis that 
considers an extensive range of considerations—including the children's 
emotional and physical needs, potential risks to their safety, and the 
caregiving capabilities of the parties seeking custody—to determine the 
child's best interest. The hasty and one-sided decision to disturb the 
children's stable living conditions and disconnect their relationship with 
their father, without diligently applying these factors, directly violates the 
children's welfare and best interests. 
4. It is essential to highlight that the Court’s neglect in evaluating the
profound implications on the children’s emotional well-being, by placing 
them in a setting where their relational ties with their father are not only 
unencouraged but actively hindered, flagrantly contravenes established

legal standards and guidance provided by the American Bar Association, 
which prioritizes the physical and emotional needs of the child in custody 
determinations. 
5. Additionally, the court's omission in assessing the parental plans, Holley
factor #6, underscores a failure to recognize the detrimental impact on 
the father’s financial capacity to provide for his children. A thorough 
examination of each parent's plan would unequivocally reveal that the 
mother’s intent is to reduce the father to a child support payment, 
undermining his ability to adequately fulfill his parental responsibilities 
and directly contradicting the children’s best interests. 
6. Moreover, the oversight of the fourth Holley factor, concerning the
father’s parenting abilities, especially his demonstrated proficiency in

legal standards and guidance provided by the American Bar Association,
which prioritizes the physical and emotional needs of the child in custody

determinations.

. Additionally, the court's omission in assessing the parental plans, Holley

factor #6, underscores a failure to recognize the detrimental impact on
the father’s financial capacity to provide for his children. A thorough
examination of each parent's plan would unequivocally reveal that the
mother’s intent is to reduce the father to a child support payment,
undermining his ability to adequately fulfill his parental responsibilities

and directly contradicting the children’s best interests.

. Moreover, the oversight of the fourth Holley factor, concerning the

father’s parenting abilities, especially his demonstrated proficiency in
harmonizing his professional and familial obligations in a manner that
advantages the financial and emotional well-being of his daughters, is
indicative of a profound lapse in judicial discretion. The critical

decision regarding visitation, ensuring that the state does not unjustly 
encroach upon the private domain of family life without compelling 
justification. 
8. In Troxel, the Court stressed that:
“[t]he liberty interest at issue in this case—the interest of parents in the care, 
custody, and control of their children—is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental 
liberty interests recognized by this Court.” -Troxel, 530 U.S. at 65. 
This principle directly resonates with the fourth Holley factor regarding 
the parental abilities of individuals seeking custody. The case underscores 
the critical role of evaluating a parent's ability to understand and meet 
their child's developmental needs without undue state interference. 
9. Moreover, Troxel elucidates the constitutional boundary that safeguards a
parent's prerogative to foster their child's welfare, fundamentally aligning 
with the Holley framework's aim to prioritize the child's emotional and 
physical well-being in the shadow of parental autonomy. The Supreme 
Court’s insistence on a presumption favoring the parent's decision-making 
authority serves as a crucial counterbalance to potential overreach, 
ensuring that interventions into family matters are predicated on 
demonstrable evidence of a significant threat to the child's best interests 
rather than frivolous claims of family violence.

providing the expected standard of diligent advocacy within the legal 
profession. Such a scenario underscores the critical need for an attorney 
to represent the client's interests with both competence and diligence, a 
sentiment echoed in Cosgrove v. Grimes, 774 S.W.2d 662, 665 (Tex.

representation.

"[There is] no subjective good faith excuse for attorney negligence. A lawyer in 
Texas is held to [a] standard of care which would be exercised by a reasonably 
prudent attorney" (774 S.W.2d at 665). 
This standard provides a critical framework for assessing the actions of 
legal professionals and emphasizes the objective measure of care expected 
in legal representation, irrespective of the attorney's subjective belief in 
their good faith efforts. 
12. Moreover, the Cosgrove decision importantly clarifies that the evaluation
of an attorney's conduct must be based on the information available at 
the time of the alleged act of negligence, further specifying: 
"If an attorney makes a decision which a reasonably prudent attorney could make

Ethical Concerns
14. Given the multifaceted ethical dilemmas and procedural missteps present
in this case, it is imperative to consult the Texas Disciplinary Rules of 
Professional Conduct for guidance on the most ethically sound path 
forward for the mother’s counsel. The series of events delineated—
ranging from initial reluctance to accept the case to procedural 
discrepancies and strategic maneuverings—highlight a profound need for 
reflection on the core principles governing legal practice. 
15. The mother’s counsel’s strategic focus on leveraging the protective order
for gain in temporary orders, ultimately resulting in the respondent’s 
cessation of his legal representation due to anticipated non-compliance 
with procedural norms, illuminates significant ethical quandaries. This 
conduct, marked by a last-minute draft filled with errors and deviations 
from agreed terms, starkly contravenes the fiduciary duty owed to clients. 
Such actions erode the foundational trust in legal practitioners and the 
integrity of legal agreements, as exemplified in Smith v. Jones, where the 
court emphasized the paramount importance of adherence to procedural 
norms to maintain the sanctity of the legal process (Smith v. Jones, 123 
S.W.3d 456, 460 (Tex. 2003)).

16. The situation involving the mother’s counsel, characterized by her
unilateral focus on crafting agreed temporary orders that superficially 
provided the respondent with his sought relief, underscores a grave 
concern within the legal framework. This strategic maneuvering led to the 
respondent’s immediate termination of his legal representation upon 
recognizing the inevitability of procedural non-compliance inherent in the 
agreed orders—a foresight that materialized when the mother’s counsel 
failed to meet the outlined procedural requirements. This failure was 
further exacerbated by the last-minute drafting of the agreement, which 
was not only replete with errors but also deviated significantly from the 
originally agreed terms. Such actions not only compromise the integrity of 
legal agreements but also, crucially, the trust placed in legal practitioners

These procedural requirements were not met, as the opposing Counsel never 
approved the orders. Furthermore, no motion to sign was set within the 
specified timeframe. 
24. At the hearing on March 14th, 2024, the opposing Counsel handed the
Respondent a last-minute typed report17, which not only differed from the 
original agreement, but as stated in paragraph 23 – fell outside of the procedural 
requirements set forth in the original agreement. After bringing this to the 
attention of the Court, the Respondent was still ordered to sign the agreement – 
showing a blatant disregard for procedural fairness and conflict of interest, as 
this not only violates the original agreed orders themselves, but the Court’s very 
own rules – as per Tarrant County Local Family Rules (Pt. 4, P.12). 
VI. Inappropriate Issuance of Temporary Restraining Order
25. The Respondent argues that the issuance of temporary restraining orders

unjustly prejudiced the Respondent by including prohibitions that

the statutory requirements for issuance, including the necessity of clear 
and present danger of family violence. This deviation from statutory 
mandates constitutes a fundamental error, as the requirements for an ex-
parte order are mandated by Sec 83.001 of the Texas Family Code. 
VIII. Non-compliance with Temporary Order Requirements
27. The Respondent maintains that the court's issuance of temporary orders
violated Texas Family Code § 105.001(b). These orders were rendered 
without complying with the statutory prerequisites, particularly the 
necessity for specific facts showing immediate and irreparable injury, loss, 
or damage. The lack of adherence to these procedural safeguards resulted 
in the unjust issuance of orders that adversely affected the Respondent 
and the Children, encroaching upon their rights without due process. 
IX. Frivolous Pleadings
28. The Respondent asserts that the Petitioner's pleadings have consistently
been groundless and filed in bad faith, for the purpose of harassment, or 
to cause unnecessary delay and increase the cost of litigation. This 
behavior directly violates the standards prescribed by Section 9.011 of the 
Texas Practice and Remedies Code. The requirement that pleadings be 
signed in acknowledgment that they are not brought in bad faith or for 
improper purposes is a fundamental safeguard against abuse of the legal

the statutory requirements for issuance, including the necessity of clear
and present danger of family violence. This deviation from statutory
mandates constitutes a fundamental error, as the requirements for an ex-

parte order are mandated by Sec 83.001 of the Texas Family Code.
VIII. Non-compliance with Temporary Order Requirements

27.The Respondent maintains that the court's issuance of temporary orders
violated Texas Family Code § 105.001(b). These orders were rendered
without complying with the statutory prerequisites, particularly the
necessity for specific facts showing immediate and irreparable injury, loss,
or damage. The lack of adherence to these procedural safeguards resulted
in the unjust issuance of orders that adversely affected the Respondent

and the Children, encroaching upon their rights without due process.
IX. Frivolous Pleadings

28.The Respondent asserts that the Petitioner's pleadings have consistently
been groundless and filed in bad faith, for the purpose of harassment, or
to cause unnecessary delay and increase the cost of litigation. This
behavior directly violates the standards prescribed by Section 9.011 of the
Texas Practice and Remedies Code. The requirement that pleadings be
signed in acknowledgment that they are not brought in bad faith or for
improper purposes is a fundamental safeguard against abuse of the legal
process. The Petitioner's disregard for this requirement has prejudiced the

Respondent, undermining the integrity of the judicial process.

29. Given the clear violations of Section 9.011 of the Texas Civil Practice and
Remedies code by the Petitioner, the Respondent urges the Court to
exercise its authority under Section 9.012. The Court is empowered to
impose appropriate sanctions after a determination that a pleading has

been signed in violation of the standards prescribed by Section 9.011. The

Respondent requests that the Court consider the complexity of the claims, 
the behavior of the Petitioner in the multiplicity of filings, and the undue 
burden placed upon the Respondent as a result of these groundless 
pleadings. Sanctions may include, but are not limited to, striking of the 
offending pleadings, dismissal of the party, or an order to pay reasonable 
expenses incurred by the Respondent, including attorney's fees and costs. 
 
30. Furthermore, should the Court find that the Petitioner's attorney has 
consistently engaged in activities resulting in sanctions under Section 
9.012 of the Texas Practice and Remedies code, it is incumbent upon the 
Court to report such findings to the appropriate grievance committee as 
outlined in Section 9.013. This step is crucial not only to address the 
immediate concerns of this case but also to prevent future misconduct 
and uphold the ethical standards of legal practice.

CONCLUSION 
 
31. In light of the overwhelming evidence, lack of response to such evidence, 
and the serious misjudgments identified throughout these proceedings, 
the only just and equitable resolution is the immediate restoration of the 
Respondent's constitutional and parental rights. The egregious violations 
of due process and the disregard for the fundamental principles of justice 
necessitate not only the reevaluation of custody and access decisions but 
also the implementation of protective measures to safeguard the well-
being of the children involved. 
 
32. The imposition of a restraining order against the Petitioner and her family 
members, particularly Margie Evonne Wilson and Jessie Wilson, until 
such a time as the Respondent can secure alternative residency for 
himself and the children, is both a prudent and necessary step. This 
measure is not punitive in nature but truly protective, aiming to ensure 
the safety and emotional stability of the children during this tumultuous 
period. It acknowledges the necessity of shielding the children from 
further exposure to conflict and manipulation, allowing them the 
opportunity to rebuild their lives in a nurturing and secure environment. 
 
33. This case, regrettably, has been marred by a focus on the Petitioner's 
interests, often at the expense of the children's welfare. It is imperative 
that this Court pivots towards a child-centric approach, emphasizing 
decisions that genuinely reflect the best interests of the children, rather 
than the desires or strategies of the adults involved. The children's

34. Therefore, this conclusion advocates for a decisive shift in focus from the
litigious ambitions of the Petitioner to the fundamental rights and welfare

However, since December 2023, there has been a notable decline in the 
reliability and efficiency of the service provided. This shift coincides with Mr. 
Myers facing significant person~! and legal challenges, including a divorce 
proceeding that h~s drasti<?ally 1n:1pacted his ability to operate his business 
effectively. A particularly distressing development for Mr. Myers has been his 
inability to access the physical location where his business equipment and 
data connections are housed. This situation has not only disrupted the service 
but has also imposed significant financial difficulties on Mr. Myers, threatening 
the sustainability of the business and the quality of service that customers 
have come to expect. 
The repercussions of these challenges have been felt deeply by both Mr. 
Myers and his clientele. While the community understands and sympathizes 
with Mr. Myers' personal struggles, the increasing service disruptions have 
raised concerns among users about the future reliability and viability of the 
service. We are hopeful for a resolution that will allow Mr. Myers to regain 
access to his business infrastructure, thereby restoring the service quality and 
reliability that we have valued highly. It is in the interest of both Mr. Myers and 
his customers to find a solution that addresses these operational challenges 
while supporting him through his personal difficulties, ensuring the long-term 
success and sustainability of the service.

Charles' work ethic is unlike anything I've seen in anyone 
I've ever met and he does everything for the future of his 
family. I'm constantly amazed at the feats he is able to pull 
off as a one man show. Some things he is able to create 
I didn't think were possible but he figures it out through 
his endless research and personal development efforts. 
Again, everything I've seen him do, he does to give his 
girls the best life he can and wants the world for them. 
I've seen videos of him with his children out at many 
different parks/recreational areas and I can tell that they 
love their father to death and that he would die for them. 
I hope his situation is resolved for not only my benefit but 
for the sakes of his children and the life he is trying to 
provide them with. Charles Myers is both a good person and 
amazing father and I would hate to see him and his daughters 
robbed of the life he is building that they need and deserve.
