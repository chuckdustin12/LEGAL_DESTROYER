I. TEXAS PRESCEDENT REGARDING RECUSAL 
      
1. In Texas, courts operate under a foundational presumption of impartiality. 
However, this presumption can be overcome if a movant presents compelling evidence of 
bias that fundamentally threatens due process. The Texas Court of Appeals has emphasized 
this requirement: bias must be so severe that it denies the movant a fair and impartial 
hearing. In Interest of E.R.C., 496 S.W.3d 270, 280 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2016, pet. 
denied); Ex parte Ellis, 275 S.W.3d 109, 117 (Tex. App.—Austin 2008, no pet.). Simply 
put, due process mandates that all parties are heard by a neutral, detached judge. Brumit v. 
State, 206 S.W.3d 639, 644-45 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006). This is not just a procedural  
necessity; it’s enshrined in both the U.S. Constitution and the Texas Constitution. 
2. Texas courts use the "reasonable person" test to determine whether recusal is 
appropriate: Would a well-informed, impartial observer reasonably question the judge's 
impartiality based on the known facts? Hansen v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., 346 S.W.3d 
769, 776 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2011, no pet.) (quoting Sears v. Olivarez, 28 S.W.3d 611, 615 
(Tex. App.-Corpus Christi 2000, order) (en banc) (internal quotations and citations 
omitted). If the answer is yes, the movant bears the burden of proving that a recusal is 
warranted and satisfies that burden only if he shows bias or partiality to such an extent as 
to deprive him of a fair trial. See Abdygapparova v. State, 243 S.W.3d 191, 196 (Tex. App.-
San Antonio 2007, pet. ref'd). Bias sufficient to warrant a recusal commonly stems from an 
extrajudicial source. Id. When recusal is based on alleged biased rulings, they must display 
a deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make a fair judgment impossible. 
Ludlow v. DeBerry, 959 S.W.2d 265, 281 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1997, no pet.).

II. INTRODUCTION 
This case exemplifies a serious violation of core due process principles, particularly 
in the failure of the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County as a whole to substantiate its 
rulings with factual findings or evidentiary support. Such ungrounded decisions have 
resulted in substantial harm, indicating a concerning bias that jeopardizes a fair resolution. 
This bias has disrupted the parent-child relationship by unjustly favoring one parent, 
despite indications that this party has prioritized personal interests over the children’s 
welfare, while penalizing the other without lawful basis. 
Without any factual or legal justification for these decisions, the only reasonable 
inference is an underlying bias, likely fueled by either fraudulent pleadings submitted by 
the Petitioner or an extrajudicial influence not in the record. These circumstances call for 
recusal to restore impartiality and procedural integrity. The judges’ actions contravene their 
duties under the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct, disregarding fundamental protections 
enshrined in both the U.S. Constitution and Texas law. Given these considerations, 
Respondent CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS respectfully requests that the Court grant the 
Joint Motion to Recuse and, in the interest of judicial economy, issue judgment without a 
hearing given the egregious circumstances of this matter.  
For the reasons below, and notwithstanding the points raised in the Joint Motion to 
Recuse, the Respondent requests the court grant the recusal motion and enter judgement 
immediately in the interest of justice and judicial economy.

On the very same page at the bottom, the petition further goes on to state:

10. Waiver of Waiting Period Based on Family Violence (Check only if applicable.)

Here, before even finishing the Petitioner’s first pleading, the first question arises:

2. Why would the Petitioner file paperwork for a protective order on December 
14th, 2023, if there was already an active order with a finding of family violence in place? 
Perhaps her state of mind lead to harmless error. It would be reasonable to believe that 
this slip-up wouldn’t destroy the credibility of the Petitioner, however, by waiving the 60-
day waiting period due to an active order of protection, the Petitioner must file a copy of 
this order with the court before any hearing can take place pursuant to the Tex. Fam. 
Code 6.405(b) to protect the Respondent’s right from false or misleading allegations. 
B. THE APPLICATION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER 
 
3. After setting the first document down, the next document for review would be 
yet another application for a protective order. We already know that the Petitioner has 
filed for a protective order on December 14th, 2023, claimed to already have one active in 
her original petition for divorce on December 18th, 2023, and now is requesting an 
additional protective order on December 22nd, 2023. (See Exhibit 8 attached hereto.) 
 
4. In reviewing the document, we see the following: 
 
Allegations of family violence. The need for protection. The inability to pay costs. These 
are the foundation of the Petitioner’s case, and these actions occurred during the week of 
Christmas. Further down in the application for her third protective order, it goes on to

The petitioner claims family violence occurred on December 18th, 2023, which is when 
she filed for divorce claiming that she already requested an order of protection on 
December 14th, 2023, and already had an active order of protection in place. But here, in 
the application for a protective order, she declares under penalty of perjury that family 
violence has occurred and is continuously occurring. 
5. This repeated filing pattern raises critical questions about the consistency and 
sincerity of the Petitioner’s claims. According to the record: 
• 
The Petitioner first applied for a protective order on December 14, 2023. 
• 
Shortly after, in her December 18, 2023, divorce filing, she asserts that a 
protective order is already active, which presumably refers to the December 14 
application. 
• 
Yet again, on December 22, 2023, the Petitioner submits another application 
for a protective order, citing family violence that allegedly took place on 
December 18, 2023, the same day as her divorce filing. 
6. The Petitioner’s repeated applications for protective orders within such a short 
time frame create an impression of inconsistency or overstatement, especially considering 
the lack of new, escalating incidents documented in each application. If the December 14 
and December 18 filings sufficiently described her need for protection, the necessity for a 
third protective order application just four days later is questionable.

7. Furthermore, the Petitioner’s assertion in her December 18 divorce petition 
that an active protective order is already in place could be perceived as misleading. If the 
December 14 application had yet to be fully processed or formally issued as an order, her 
claim of an “active order” may have been premature or even intentionally misleading, 
potentially influencing the court’s perception of the case’s urgency and the Respondent’s 
character. 
8. Adding to these inconsistencies, the affidavit attached to the third application, 
dated December 22, 2023, states under penalty of perjury that family violence is 
continuously occurring. This raises another crucial point: if the Petitioner truly felt that 
she was in imminent, ongoing danger, why did she not seek immediate law enforcement 
assistance following the alleged incidents, instead of submitting repeated applications to 
the court? 
     
9. Now, we turn to the Respondent’s answer and subsequent pleadings for such 
claims. 
C. THE RESPONDENT’S ORIGINAL ANSWER 
 
10. The Respondent in his original answer, attached hereto as Exhibit 7, states the 
following in regard to the claims made against him: 
“The Plaintiff, Morgan Michelle Myers, intentionally lied about allegations of 
family violence to the court, as evidenced by the complete absence of any police 
reports, medical records, or credible witnesses to corroborate such claims. I assert 
that my personal history is devoid of any such incidents and my record remains 
unblemished. Please see attached EXHIBIT B.

These unfounded allegations have caused significant undue stress and threaten the 
well-being of my children and myself. The claim that I have a history of family 
violence is categorically false and is maliciously designed to obstruct my parental 
rights and access to my children. 
The timing and nature of these allegations suggest a strategic play to influence the

These unfounded allegations have caused significant undue stress and threaten the
well-being of my children and myself. The claim that I have a history of family
violence is categorically false and is maliciously designed to obstruct my parental
rights and access to my children.

The timing and nature of these allegations suggest a strategic play to influence the
outcome of concurrent legal proceedings—specifically an eviction case and our
ongoing divorce. It appears these claims were fabricated to leverage an advantage
in these matters, rather than to protect any party from harm.

The Plaintiff also requested for joint conservatorship in the divorce and seeks co-
parenting, which directly contradicts this order in and of itself.

“Lack of Evidence: The petitioner has failed to provide any credible evidence,

substantiate the allegations of family violence. My record is clear of any such 
incidents, underscoring the baseless nature of the allegations.” Click for reference.

Petitioner’s pleadings, any reasonable finder of fact would be able to discern from the

based on what has been presented so far. 
D. THE RESPONDENT’S MOTION TO CONSOLIDATE 
 
13. On January 3rd, 2024, the Respondent submitted a motion to consolidate the 
divorce suit with the protective order suit in the interest of judicial economy to provide 
the court with more information. Amongst this information was insight that on top of the 
petitions already filed by mother between December 14, 2023, and December 22, 2023, 
she also instigated an eviction suit against the Respondent. 
 
14. On top of this new information, the respondent specifically requests in this 
consolidation motion that: 
“Evidence provided suggests that there have been misrepresentations to the court, 
including the transfer of funds from the joint account and the plaintiff’s interaction 
with third parties, which could affect both the protective order and the divorce 
outcome. The protective order – which was based on claims of family violence – 
are entirely baseless as I have no record of family violence, and no evidence from 
the Plaintiff has been provided to substantiate these claims.”

And in the conclusion, the Respondent states: 
“Given the overlapping factual and legal issues in the divorce and protective order 
cases, consolidation would serve the interests of justice and efficiency. It would 
ensure that the court has a comprehensive understanding of the intertwined nature 
of the family's circumstances, which is vital for fair and equitable resolution of 
these matters. While the eviction case may not be directly consolidated due to 
jurisdictional differences, it should be considered in context with the other cases to 
provide a complete picture of the ongoing disputes and to keep the best interests of 
our children intact.” 
– Exhibit M, Joint Motion to Recuse 
E. THE RESPONDENT’S MOTION FOR CONTINUANCE 
 
15. On January 7th, 2024, the Respondent filed a motion of continuance with an 
accompanying brief, including a parenting plan that the Respondent provided to the court 
which, among other important facts, states: 
“Continuity for Children: While we navigate these proceedings, it is critical to 
maintain stability and continuity for our children. Any temporary custody 
arrangements should reflect the least disruptive path for them.” 
 
- Exhibit L, Joint Motion to Recuse 
As well as: 
“The court's facilitation in endorsing a temporary and flexible visitation 
framework is crucial. This framework must account for the current living situation 
and the significant emotional and logistical upheaval that the divorce proceedings 
have caused.”

It should have already been apparent from the fact finder that based on the pleadings

other submits a flurry of lawsuits in an attempt to discard the Respondent from his home.

21. There isn’t one. This is why since this decision has been made, nothing else 
has happened in the case outside of the Father seeking relief first in the form of a 
reconsideration motion followed by seeking relief in the Texas Court of Appeals. The 
ongoing deprivation without justification not only showcases an egregious disregard for 
the law, but a disregard for the Texas families that judicial officers are elected to protect. 
 
22. When considering that the Respondent has filed over 1,500 pages of 
information seeking relief without a single explanation from the court, has uncovered the 
Petitioner’s true motive for her initial pleadings, has shown she falsified her indigenous 
status, and that her actions have severely damaged not only the Respondent’s business 
and ability to provide for his Children, but the emotional stability they rely on for their 
development. 
 
23. As pointed out in the motion to reconsider evidence heard on March 14th, 
2024, the Petitioner texted two individuals outside of the marriage to the amount of 
16,500 times within the scope of a year, visited their residency 18 hours on average per 
week, admitted to defrauding the marital estate, admitted to receiving help filing her 
fraudulent pleadings, and has shown through her actions that she is not a fit parent, and 
the current arrangements remain in place solely because of the judge’s refusal to follow 
the law. 
 
24. When you consider the following information on top of how this case was 
founded, it’s clear that a willful deprivation of constitutional rights is taking place by the 
court, and the recusal of both judges must be granted as a matter of law.

13. The actions of Judges Munford and Judge Kaitcer demonstrate a clear 
departure from the standards of impartiality and integrity mandated by Canon 3 of the 
Texas Code of Judicial Conduct. The facts before this court reveal a pattern of procedural 
inconsistencies and biased decision-making that stem, in large part, from the Petitioner’s 
misleading filings—an influence that both judges have inadvertently allowed to impact 
their rulings. Even though such information may have been obtained during the 
proceedings, no findings have been made justifying the initial decision, which only leaves 
the appearance of impartiality, which is enough to warrant recusal. See Rogers v. Bradley, 
909 S.W.2d 872, 873 (Tex.1995) (“Declaration of Recusal” by Gammage, J.) (noting that 
issue is one of perception). (“[B]eyond the demand that a judge be impartial is the

the fairness or integrity of the court.”; see also Sears v. Olivarez, 28 S.W.3d 611, 613–14

Carter’s authority, one needs to look no further than the current temporary orders in 
place, which is attached as Exhibit I in the original joint motion to recuse filed on 
October 7, 2024. 
19. On page 1, the orders read: “On February 1, 2024, the Court heard Petitioner's 
motion for temporary orders.” A review of the record will show that no motion for 
temporary orders has been served to the Respondent in this matter, no notice of hearing 
was served to the parties regarding such a motion, and no hearing ever occurred 
regarding this motion. 
20. The orders move on to state that both parties “appeared by counsel and 
announced ready” and “signed an agreed associate judge’s report” when in fact, both 
parties appeared, but were rushed into a settlement agreement by the Respondent’s prior 
counsel due to his unwillingness to remain in the courthouse all day, leading to his 
termination. Steve Myers, a witness, was present in the conference room during this 
exchange. Neither party went before the judge on February 1st, 2024. See Exhibit 6.

a hearing scheduled to challenge their legal foundation.  
23. Notwithstanding the above, the mere fact that the orders state “[t]he parties 
have agreed to the terms of this order as evidenced by the signatures below.” and no 
signature from the Respondent is present showcases a pre-determined outcome, and a 
one-sided favoritism that warrants recusal. 
24. Finally, and most concerning, is the fact that Judge Jeff Kaitcer affixed his 
signature to this document which states that “[t]he Court, after examining the record and 
the agreement of the parties and hearing the evidence and argument of counsel, finds that 
all necessary prerequisites of the law have been legally satisfied and that the Court has 
jurisdiction of this case and of all the parties.” 
25. The foregoing statement can’t possibly be true for two reasons. 1) No evidence 
has been admitted into this case, and no argument from counsel was presented – only 
baseless objections without foundation. 2) The associate judge could not have possibly 
examined the record, because it is apparent that consent was not present at the time of

22. Given that an agreement was clearly not reached, the orders were reduced to

26. Expanding on point 2 above, the associate judge could not possibly have 
examined the record because in the original answer to the protective order filed by the 
Respondent, he claimed duress as an affirmative defense alongside fraud and illegality. 
See Exhibit 7.  
27. There can be no claim of duress unless the following elements are present: (1) 
a threat or action taken without legal justification; (2) the threat or action was of such a 
character as to destroy the other party's free agency; (3) the threat or action overcame the 
opposing party's free will, causing them to do something they would not otherwise have 
done and were not legally bound to do; (4) the restraint was imminent; and (5) the 
opposing party had no present means of protection (McMahan v. Greenwood, 108 S.W.3d 
467, 482 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2003, pet. denied)). 
28. The Petitioner’s actions—including seeking an emergency ex parte order, 
initiating an eviction, filing for divorce, and pursuing an additional protective order—
occurred within an 8-day span, representing actions taken without legal justification. 
29. These actions threatened the Respondent’s livelihood by removing him from 
the residence he needed to provide for his children, as well as from the home where his 
children had been raised with their father. This threat materialized on January 16, 2024, 
when the Respondent was ordered to vacate the residence without justification.

31. If the Respondent did not sign, he would have faced no alternative other than

proceeding to a hearing, leaving him without a viable means of protection at that time.

Why would Cooper Carter affix her signature to pleadings filed by Roderick Marx,

appearance before the court, such as a hearing or trial. Per Tex. R. Civ. P. 21(a), every 
pleading, plea, motion, or application to the court for an order—whether presented as a 
motion, plea, or other request—must be filed with the court clerk in writing, state the

Rules of Civil Procedure, including docketing all missing items listed in Exhibit 4 and 
following the service requirements in Rule 21a when scheduling the hearing. Informal 
notices via email only obscure the opportunity for an appeal and fail to comply with 
Texas Civil Procedure. The court cannot continue to overlook its duty to correct these 
oversights, nor can it ignore state laws to uphold decisions lacking any legal justification.

41. When such actions come from a vindictive parent willing to falsify their

IV. CONCLUSION 
Recusing Judges Munford and Kaitcer is the first step to restore the Respondent’s 
rights as all other state remedies have been exhausted. These are essential first steps this 
court can now take. These actions will not only uphold Canon 3(D)’s standards but will 
also correct procedural injustices, ensuring that the case can proceed in alignment with 
the highest principles of fairness and impartiality. Such measures will allow new judges 
to enter the case and review the facts unobscured by the intentional deceptions that have 
compromised these proceedings, ultimately protecting the children’s best interests as 
mandated by the Texas Family Code. 
Given the court’s decision to stop docketing pleadings at the time the recusal 
motion was filed, along with its handling of the matter outside established legal 
standards, any reasonable member of the public, fully informed of the facts, would 
reasonably question whether the judges were acting impartially in this case. 
Such impartiality has rewarded a mother that has fabricated not only her financial 
status to this court, but also a false need for protection that should be taken as serious 
violations that are apparent from the face of her pleadings. To continuously deprive a 
parent of his constitutionally protected rights to his children and residency despite being 
given every opportunity to correct the situation showcases a blatant refusal by the current 
judges to either fix the situation or provide legal justification for their decisions.

Texas. I am above 18 years of age, competent to make this affidavit, and have 
personal knowledge of the facts stated herein, which are true and correct. 
2. Procedural Violations and Due Process Concerns 
Since the initiation of this case, I have encountered numerous procedural 
irregularities that have obstructed my right to a fair hearing. I was removed from 
my residence and separated from my children on January 16, 2024, based solely 
on allegations made by the Petitioner, without any evidentiary findings or an 
opportunity to defend myself in a formal hearing. This deprivation of my rights 
was executed without adherence to the foundational principles of due process. 
3. Duress in Signing the February 1, 2024, Agreement 
On February 1, 2024, I was compelled to sign an agreement that I did not fully 
understand nor agree with. This agreement allowed me limited access back into 
my residence but resulted in the removal of my children from their home. My 
decision to sign was made under duress, as I was advised by my attorney to accept 
these terms rather than proceed to a hearing, due to the potential of further 
exclusion from my home and livelihood. I felt I had no other viable option to 
safeguard my ability to continue providing for my children. 
4. Bias and Lack of Impartiality 
I have serious concerns regarding the impartiality of Judges Munford and Kaitcer, 
as the procedural management of this case has shown a consistent disregard for 
my rights. My filings and objections have been met with resistance and have often

proceeded unchecked, despite containing misleading and unsubstantiated claims. 
This pattern of favoritism and procedural leniency towards the Petitioner has 
compromised the integrity of these proceedings. 
5. Misrepresentation and Lack of Consent in Orders 
The current orders on record falsely state that both parties appeared before the 
court on February 1, 2024, announced readiness, and signed an agreed associate 
judge’s report. In reality, there was no formal hearing or review of evidence on 
that date, and I did not give my consent to the terms as recorded. Furthermore, the 
orders assert that necessary legal prerequisites were met, when, in fact, no such 
procedural steps were observed. These inaccuracies directly impact my rights and 
the fairness of these proceedings. 
6. Unethical Conduct and Professional Misconduct 
The Petitioner’s counsel, Ms. Carter, signed and submitted pleadings containing 
false statements, misrepresenting my consent to the orders and claiming that a 
hearing had occurred when it had not. This conduct violates Rule 4.01(a) of the 
Texas Rules of Disciplinary Conduct and Canon 3(D)(2) of the Texas Code of 
Judicial Conduct. Such behavior not only misleads the court but also deprives me 
of a fair and just resolution. 
7. Need for Recusal 
Given these procedural irregularities, false representations, and lack of impartiality 
demonstrated by Judges Munford and Kaitcer, I respectfully request their recusal 
from this case. Their actions and the management of this case have created an

hearing had occurred when it had not. This conduct violates Rule 4.01(a) of the
Texas Rules of Disciplinary Conduct and Canon 3(D)(2) of the Texas Code of
Judicial Conduct. Such behavior not only misleads the court but also deprives me

of a fair and just resolution.

. Need for Recusal

Given these procedural irregularities, false representations, and lack of impartiality
demonstrated by Judges Munford and Kaitcer, I respectfully request their recusal

from this case. Their actions and the management of this case have created an

appearance of partiality, depriving me of my right to due process and casting 
doubt on the integrity of these proceedings. 
8. Request for Judicial Review and Corrective Action 
I request that this court take immediate action to address the procedural oversights, 
docket missing filings as per Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and ensure an 
impartial review of the facts in this case. I seek a fair hearing, free from bias, 
where the truth can be assessed without obstruction. In the interest of justice, I also 
urge the court to examine the Petitioner’s documented misrepresentations and their 
impact on the well-being of my children, M.E.M. and C.R.M. 
 
9. Conclusion 
This affidavit is submitted with sincere intent to restore fairness and procedural 
integrity to these proceedings, not out of malice or animosity toward any 
individual involved. My only goal is to reach a resolution that genuinely considers 
the best interests of my children and respects my constitutional rights as a parent. 
I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.
