to Petitioner in the presence of the children.

15. The court, at this point, is choosing to not grant relief despite having no reason 
to do so. 
16. This litigation has no possible means to an end, and it should be dismissed 
outright so that the SAPCR may continue. 
17. There has been no filed opposition, objection, or arguments made against the 
Respondent’s position in either suit. 
18. The Petitioner has wasted everyone’s time, caused significant damage, and 
remains hidden in fear of being held accountable. 
19. The Petitioner prioritized an extramarital affair over prosecuting the divorce, 
and the children and Respondent have been significantly harmed. 
Therefore, this case should be dismissed as a matter of law. Every day causes more 
irreparable harm, and this court has every ability and reason to rectify this situation immediately. 
Respondent already has the solution and has been the only party in this matter seeking relief. It is 
simply unacceptable to permit this to continue. 
 
Respectfully submitted,
