Statement of Facts 
Relator, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, is referred to herein as “Father.” 
Real Party in Interest, MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS, is referred to herein at 
“Mother”. Each record citation marked with (R. X-X) is referencing the separately 
filed FIRST AMENDED CONSOLIDATED MANDAMUS RECORD currently 
present within each case. 
A. 
The Precipitating Event and Background Facts 
The events giving rise to these proceedings began on December 12, 2023, 
when the father discovered a series of text message exchanges between the mother 
and two individuals outside the marriage—identified in the record as Damen 
Kazlauskas and Debbie Price (R. 253–711). This discovery occurred shortly after 
the mother’s abrupt announcement of her intent to divorce and raised concerns 
regarding the children’s well-being and emotional environment. In an effort to 
address the matter constructively, the father contacted the mother’s grandfather— 
who resides next door to the marital home—via text message to request a family 
meeting to discuss the situation (R. 717–720). 
The following day, however, when Father confronted Mother with the 
discovery—presenting his concerns in the form of data visualizations (R. 255– 
257)—she began distancing herself, starting by redirecting the planned family 
conversation into a private meeting solely between herself and her grandparents

Statement of Facts

Relator, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, is referred to herein as “Father.”
Real Party in Interest, MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS, is referred to herein at
“Mother”. Each record citation marked with (R. X-X) is referencing the separately
filed FIRST AMENDED CONSOLIDATED MANDAMUS RECORD currently
present within each case.

A. The Precipitating Event and Background Facts

The events giving rise to these proceedings began on December 12, 2023,
when the father discovered a series of text message exchanges between the mother
and two individuals outside the marriage—identified in the record as Damen
Kazlauskas and Debbie Price (R. 253-711). This discovery occurred shortly after
the mother’s abrupt announcement of her intent to divorce and raised concerns
regarding the children’s well-being and emotional environment. In an effort to
address the matter constructively, the father contacted the mother’s grandfather—
who resides next door to the marital home—via text message to request a family
meeting to discuss the situation (R. 717-720).

The following day, however, when Father confronted Mother with the
discovery—presenting his concerns in the form of data visualizations (R. 255—
257)—she began distancing herself, starting by redirecting the planned family

conversation into a private meeting solely between herself and her grandparents

(R. 1715). On December 14, 2023, Mother initiated text communication with her  
stepfather, Dan Branthoover, who resides in Yukon, Oklahoma (R. 274–278). Mr. 
Branthoover then contacted Father via text message, stating that he wanted to help 
both parties and requested a phone conversation (R. 1703-1704). That conversation 
resulted in an arrangement for Mother to travel to Mr. Branthoover’s residence 
over the weekend beginning December 15, 2023, where Mr. Branthoover later 
acknowledged that he would be assisting with the divorce paperwork (R. 1710). 
During this same period, Mother also sought an ex parte emergency protective 
order against Father from the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County, as 
referenced in her divorce petition (R. 78 at 9B). 
B. 
Travel, Influence and Conversion of Marital Assets 
While en route to, or upon arrival at, Mr. Branthoover’s residence, Mother 
withdrew the entirety of the funds from the joint marital bank account, totaling 
$1,576 (R. 723; 1716–1717). The transaction was facilitated by Mr. Branthoover, 
who used his PayPal account—identified as “dmb575” (R. 1707)—as an 
intermediary to transfer the funds. This identifier corresponds to the relevant 
December 2023 bank statement (R. 1706). Both Mr. Branthoover and Mother later 
admitted that the transaction had occurred (R. 1709, 1716). 
As a result, on December 16, 2023, Father was notified that the joint account 
had been overdrawn, which caused the suspension of his business’s advertising

services due to a failed payment (R. 726–727). Father subsequently contacted Mr.  
Branthoover in writing to request the return of the funds, explaining that the money 
was needed to cover essential family expenses and to purchase Christmas presents 
for the children (R. 728–729). During this exchange, Mr. Branthoover explicitly 
informed Father that Mother’s visit was for the purpose of receiving assistance 
with the preparation of divorce paperwork (R. 730). 
C. 
The Eviction Attempt 
The situation escalated further on December 17, 2023, when Father was 
served with an eviction notice by Mother’s grandmother, Margie Wilson. The notice 
cited a protective order and a divorce petition as the basis for eviction, despite those 
documents not having been formally filed at the time (R. 735). The case was later 
heard by the Honorable Judge Swearingin Jr. and was dismissed for lack of subject 
matter jurisdiction (R. 736–737) on January 17, 2024. 
D. 
The Divorce Petition 
On December 18, 2023, Mother formally filed for divorce (R. 71–81) and 
requested an “Uncontested Cases” form from the court (R. 101). In her divorce 
petition, she claimed that the parties had stopped living together as spouses on or 
around December 1, 2023 (R. 74 at 4). She also asserted financial indigence, 
stating that she had only $21 in her bank account (R. 91) while being responsible 
for $1,610 in monthly expenses (R. 92). Contradicting the timeline established by

requested an “Uncontested Cases” form from the court (R. 101). In her divorce
petition, she claimed that the parties had stopped living together as spouses on or

the eviction notice served the previous day, the petition further alleged that an   
active protective order was already in place against Father, and that a finding of 
family violence had been made during the marriage—thereby waiving the statutory 
60-day waiting period (R. 78 at 10). 
Mother further claimed that the marital property would be divided by 
agreement yet designated both family vehicles as her separate property (R. 79). 
She requested joint managing conservatorship (R. 75 at 6D) and sought standard 
visitation rights for Father (R. 76 at 6F), while simultaneously alleging that she 
and the children could face abuse or serious harm if Father were provided with her 
contact information (R. 81 at 15). 
E. 
The Protective Order 
Four days after filing for divorce, on December 22, 2023, Mother filed an 
application for a protective order (R. 103–109). In supporting documents, 
including an affidavit (R. 108) and an unsworn declaration, she alleged that family 
violence occurred on December 18, 2023—the same day she filed for divorce (R. 
109). 
However, evidence indicates that on that same day, Mother was present at 
the family home with Father, exhibiting no signs of being in a state of emergency 
(R. 1692). Mother continued to cohabit with Father intermittently following these 
filings, as evidenced by her presence at the family home on December 29, 2023,

participating in a typical evening with Father and the children (R. 1716). Father 
was formally served with the protective order suit on December 27, 2023 (R. 117-
118). 
Within the protective order application, Mother requested that Father be 
prohibited from approaching within 200 feet of the children’s school, that he cease 
all communication with her, and that he complete a battering intervention and 
prevention program (R. 105). She acknowledged the joint ownership of the 
matrimonial residence but nonetheless requested spousal support, child support, 
and Father’s immediate removal from the home (R. 106). Adding another layer to 
the situation, the day after the divorce was filed—on December 19, 2023—Mr. 
Branthoover contacted Father via text message, claiming to represent Mother in the 
legal proceedings (R. 1712). Despite these filings and allegations, Father continued 
to cohabit with Mother leading up to the first scheduled legal proceeding: a show 
cause hearing set for January 16, 2024. During this interim period, Father 
prioritized the children and spent time with them during their holiday break (R. 
826–829).

F. Father Prepares His Defense

In response to the series of legal actions initiated by Mother, Father waited

until after the children’s Christmas holiday to formally begin preparing his

defense. He first filed an original answer to the protective order application,

=== PAGE 11 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---

denying all allegations of family violence (R. 129–133).  
In his answer, Father raised the affirmative defenses of fraud, illegality, and 
duress, asserting that Mother was attempting to misuse the legal process (R. 131). 
To support his position, Father attached two exhibits: the first was a copy of his 
Texas Department of Public Safety (TxDPS) record, demonstrating no history of 
violence (R. 134–136); the second highlighted inconsistencies within Mother’s 
divorce petition (R. 137–140). Subsequently, on January 3, 2024, Father filed a 
motion to consolidate the protective order proceedings with the divorce case (R. 
142–145). He also submitted a background report intended to provide the court 
with context regarding the children’s familial circumstances (R. 146–148). Father

In his answer, Father raised the affirmative defenses of fraud, illegality, and
duress, asserting that Mother was attempting to misuse the legal process (R. 131).
To support his position, Father attached two exhibits: the first was a copy of his
Texas Department of Public Safety (TxDPS) record, demonstrating no history of
violence (R. 134—136); the second highlighted inconsistencies within Mother’s
divorce petition (R. 137-140). Subsequently, on January 3, 2024, Father filed a
motion to consolidate the protective order proceedings with the divorce case (R.
142-145). He also submitted a background report intended to provide the court
with context regarding the children’s familial circumstances (R. 146-148). Father

the matter temporarily. Judge Munford granted a continuance but also ordered 
Father to vacate the family residence effective immediately—without conducting 
an evidentiary hearing, making specific findings, or considering Father’s submitted 
pleadings or the children’s needs. This resulted in a de facto temporary termination 
of Father’s custodial rights, and the case was reset for January 22, 2024, to be 
heard by the Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer (R. 182–185). 
Faced with the sudden loss of his residence and access to his children, Father 
sought legal representation immediately and retained attorney Daniel R. Bacalis on 
January 19, 2024—just three days before the rescheduled hearing (R. 818 at 9).

At the third scheduled setting on February 1, 2024, both parties arrived with 
their respective counsel and announced they were ready to proceed.  However, 
instead of the matter being heard by Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer, father’s counsel, 
Mr. Bacalis, drafted an “Agreed Associate Judge’s Report” which was presented to 
father in the hallway outside the courtroom. (R. 228-234). This proposed 
agreement included terms to non-suit (dismiss) the protective order application, 
grant father residency in the family home only until March 1, 2024, and outline the 
division of financial responsibilities (R. 231-232). 
Father expressed significant reservations and initially refused to sign the 
agreed order, stating his desire to proceed to trial to address mother's allegations 
directly and hold her accountable, where he was told by his counsel, “I know the 
judge, this is the best we can get,” and felt pressured into signing the agreement as 
the only presented option, which is corroborated by father’s witness in an affidavit 
(R. 1367-1369). Feeling frustrated by this outcome, father paid particular attention 
to the procedural requirements highlighted in bold text within the agreement signed 
on February 1, 2024 (R. 233). The Father then realized that if he terminated his

Setting #4 – Emergency Motion to Vacate and Reconsider Evidence 
Father appeared for the scheduled hearing on his Emergency Motion (R. 
793).2  Upon entering the courtroom, he was handed a document titled “Temporary 
Orders,” which was a modified version of the February 1, 2024, agreement 
previously prepared by Father’s former counsel (R. 887). These orders were 
prepared by Cooper L. Carter after the 20-day deadline stipulated in the original 
agreement. No agreement had been reached, as evidenced by the parties’ presence 
in court to contest the matter, and no motion to sign had been set or filed—contrary 
to the judge’s prior directive (R. 233) and agreement of the parties. 
The proposed orders also claimed that a hearing had been held on February 
1, 2024, for “Mother’s Motion for Temporary Orders,”3  and that all parties were 
in agreement with the terms “as evidenced by the signatures below” (R. 888). In 
reality, the February 1 setting resulted only in an associate judge’s report, drafted 
informally in the hallway by Father’s prior counsel. Despite this, the proposed 
order stated that the court “heard evidence and argument”—a statement Father 
asserts was inaccurate (R. 888). At that time, the only other scheduled hearing was

Once the hearing began, Father’s Emergency Motion was denied without  
explanation, and he was ordered to sign the very agreement he had appeared in 
court to contest (R. 794-795). Notably, the order itself contained two distinct sets 
of handwriting, was prepared by the opposing counsel, and Father refused to sign 
the document because he did not agree to its terms (R. 795). Notably, Father also 
refused to sign the Temporary Orders claiming his consent (R. 925). No order was 
ever issued regarding Father’s Emergency Motion to Vacate. 
Following the setting, Father began exploring his appellate remedies and 
drafted a Preparatory Notice for Judicial Review, which he later amended twice 
(R. 797–846). The document provided a detailed account of the parties’ family 
background (R. 807), employment history, and household dynamics (R. 808–815). 
It included a statement of facts segmented into background facts (R. 816–817), 
procedural facts (R. 817–821), and undisputed evidentiary facts (R. 822–825). The 
pleading also contained video evidence of Father with the children during the 
Mother’s initial campaign to have him removed from the residence (R. 826-829). 
Appended to the filing were affidavits from Father’s business clients 
attesting to his need to remain in the marital residence for professional reasons 
pending the divorce (R. 850–852, R. 853–855, R. 856–858, R. 859–861, R. 862–

On May 9, 2024, Cooper L. Carter emailed Father requesting his signature

On August 30, 2024, this Court declined to hear Father’s mandamus
petition, and the trial court was notified (R. 1157-1162). Immediately following
the denial, Father prepared a Motion for Rehearing, which he submitted and later
amended in mid-September (R. 1135-1156). The court was notified of the
rehearing filing (R. 1163-1168).

O. Challenge to Opposing Counsel’s Authority Under Rule 12

After filing the Motion for Rehearing with this Court, Father served
discovery requests on the opposing party, including Requests for Production of
Documents (R. 1410-1411) and Requests for Admissions (R. 1411-1415). In
addition, Father filed a motion under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12,
challenging Cooper L. Carter’s authority to represent Mother in the trial court (R.
1169-1177).

This challenge was based on ambiguity surrounding Ms. Carter’s

employment status and the fact that her pleadings were being filed by Roderick D.

case (R. 219, R. 1016). 
P. 
Declining Resources and Exhaustion of Remedies 
Facing rapidly declining credit, reduced income (R. 1717–1718), and limited 
housing options, Father filed an Emergency Motion for Temporary Orders on 
September 24, 2024, requesting relief by October 1, 2024 (R. 1183–1195). When 
no relief was granted and no response was received from the opposing party, 
Father filed a motion seeking the joint recusal of Judge James Munford and 
Associate Judge Jeff Kaitcer. The motion asserted that the nature of Mother’s 
initial allegations had created an appearance of bias that could undermine fairness 
in the proceedings (R. 1196–1220). 
Q. 
The First Recusal – Procedural Abnormalities 
Two days after the recusal motion was filed, Judge James Munford declined 
to recuse himself without explanation and referred the matter to the Honorable 
David L. Evans, the 8th Administrative Regional Judge of Fort Worth (R. 1221– 
1243). Upon reviewing this referral, Father observed that the version of the motion 
submitted to Judge Evans differed significantly from the one he originally filed. 
Father’s original filing was a single, 20.21 MB hyperlinked PDF submitted via the 
re:SearchTX platform (R. 1253-1254). The version transmitted to Judge Evans was 
missing exhibits and the supporting affidavit. Father notified the court coordinator

of the discrepancy and noted that the file was approximately 18 MB smaller (R. 
1254–1255). Receiving no response, Father filed a formal notice with the court 
outlining these procedural irregularities (R. 1245–1252). 
The following day, Judge Munford issued an amended order of referral and again 
declined to recuse, without explanation (R. 1281–1283). This time, the recusal 
motion was divided into three separate files, with the court citing the "size of the 
motion" as justification (R. 1356-1357). Father objected to the handling of the 
recusal process (R. 1268–1280), noting that the Tarrant County District Clerk’s 
publicly available filing guidelines instruct litigants to compile all exhibits into a 
single document (R. 1272 at 9). He also noted that his original 20.21 MB file was 
well within the platform’s approximately 30 MB capacity and that fragmenting the 
submission contradicted the court’s standard electronic filing protocol (R. 1271 at 
6–7).

Activity paused until October 18, 2024, when the parties received postcard 
notification that Father’s Supreme Court Motion for Rehearing had been denied

video conference regarding the recusal motion for October 30, 2024 (R. 1298–

During the scheduled video conference, internet connectivity issues arose, 
and the hearing was rescheduled to November 7, 2024, to be held in person at the 
322nd District Court. In anticipation of possible objections from opposing 
counsel—who had not filed a response to the recusal motion—Father filed a Pre- 
Trial Motion in Limine to prevent unnecessary interruptions during his 
presentation and to reiterate key facts of the case (R. 1309-1315). 
Two days later, Father submitted a Request for Confirmation of Procedural 
Requirements, respectfully asking the district clerk to provide a certified copy of  
Justice Gabriel’s oath of office, in an effort to ensure procedural transparency (R. 
1319–1324).

The First Recusal – Dental Emergency 
On the morning of the rescheduled in-person hearing, November 7, 2024, 
Father awoke experiencing significant dental distress, which he promptly 
communicated to his father (R. 1391–1392), opposing counsel and the court 
coordinator via email (R. 1394), and to Mother directly (R. 1395). Opposing 
counsel agreed in writing to reschedule the hearing due to the emergency (R.

Father filed a Motion to Enter Judgment on November 13, 2024, in which he 
articulated objections to the procedural irregularities surrounding the recusal 
proceedings (R. 1325–1369). This motion was supported by an affidavit 
elaborating upon those irregularities (R. 1346–1349). 
Shortly thereafter, Father filed a Notice of Intent to Remove the case to 
federal court, citing exhaustion of state judicial remedies and setting forth 
jurisdictional grounds for removal to the U.S. District Court for the Northern 
District of Texas (R. 1371–1397).  
On November 18, 2024, Father also submitted a Motion to Compel 
Discovery (R. 1398–1407) pertaining to discovery requests initially served on 
Mother on September 17, 2024, attached as Exhibit A (R. 1408–1418). He 
requested that the court deem the requested admissions conclusively established by 
operation of law due to Mother’s failure to respond (R. 1405). 
The recusal proceedings concluded when the court formally documented and 
served the order denying Father’s recusal motion on November 19, 2024 (R. 1422–

T. 
Federal Removal, Remand, and Initiation of Proceedings Against Daniel 
Kenneth Branthoover 
Following the denial of the recusal motion, Father spent the next two weeks 
compiling the necessary record in preparation for federal removal. On December 2, 
2024, he filed a Notice of Removal with the state trial court (R. 1425–1444). Two 
days later, however, the United States District Court remanded the matter back to 
state court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.5 
On December 14, 2024, Dan Branthoover sent Father a threatening text 
message (R. 1719–1720). At that point, Father’s financial losses had exceeded 
$75,000 (R. 1460–1462), prompting him to initiate separate federal litigation 
against Daniel Branthoover in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of 
Oklahoma. That action sought damages arising from Mr. Branthoover’s 
involvement in the events underlying this case, and was later amended (R. 1450–
1464). 
Father provided notice of the related federal case to the state trial court on 
December 31, 2024 (R. 1445–1449). The federal complaint was filed pursuant to

The divorce case remained largely inactive until January 16, 2025, when 
Father submitted a comprehensive Case Memorandum and served copies upon 
Judges James Munford and Jeff Kaitcer of the 322nd Judicial District Court, 
Visiting Retired Justice Lee Gabriel, Regional Judge David L. Evans, and 
opposing counsel Cooper L. Carter (R. 1465–1519). On January 26, 2025, Father

case by the opposing party and the Court’s time standards for divorce proceedings 
(R.1526–1533). 
On January 29, 2025, facing the imminent repossession of his primary

requesting a ruling on his long-pending Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, 
which had remained unresolved since its original filing on February 22, 2024 (R. 
1636–1656), and which the court acknowledged during the March 14, 2024, 
hearing (R. 1369). Father also filed an Objection and Request for Judicial Notice,

rulings (R. 1659–1677). 
On February 28, 2025, Father filed a Request for Ruling on his outstanding

Information, documenting Watauga Police Department involvement regarding his 
personal property being placed at the curb by Mother (R. 1686–1695). On March 
12, 2025, Father filed a Notice of Continued Obstruction, itemizing pending, 
unopposed motions and emphasizing the ongoing lack of response from opposing 
counsel (R. 1929–1942). He reinforced these concerns on March 14, 2025, through

Affecting the Parent- Child Relationship (SAPCR) in the 233rd District Court of 
Tarrant County, submitting a cover letter explaining his need for immediate relief 
for himself and his minor children (R. 2259–2277). 
V. The SAPCR Suit and the Sudden Reappearance of Counsel 
On March 18, 2025, the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County accepted 
Father’s original SAPCR petition (R. 2053–2064). Shortly thereafter, Mother 
reappeared in the litigation after several months of inactivity and filed a general 
denial in response to the SAPCR petition (R. 2278–2282). This pleading was 
submitted on behalf of Cooper L. Carter by Roderick D. Marx (R. 2282). Mr. Marx 
subsequently filed a motion to consolidate the SAPCR matter back into the original 
divorce case in the 322nd District Court (R. 2283–2286), again purporting to act 
on Ms. Carter’s behalf (R. 2286). 
Father moved to strike both the general denial and the motion to consolidate 
(R. 1956–1965) and attached an exhibit showing that opposing counsel was 
registered under a different law firm than what appeared on her pleadings. (R. 
1962–1963). Father also filed a second Rule 12 Motion challenging Cooper L. 
Carter’s authority to represent Mother in the 233rd District Court, citing Ms. 
Carter’s continued failure to formally appear and the repeated filings by Mr. Marx 
in her name (R. 2287–2300). As of the date of this filing, no response has been

W. The Emergency TRO 
On March 24, 2025, Father filed an Objection to Consolidation in the 
second-filed case (R. 1880–1888) and an Emergency Motion for Temporary 
Restraining Order (TRO), seeking to prevent Mother from restricting his access to 
the family residence and to safeguard the children (R. 2301–2326). The TRO 
incorporated the same statement of facts that remains unopposed in multiple 
pleadings (R. 2304–2312). Father then coordinated with court staff to schedule the 
presentation of his emergency motion and documented all communications (R. 
2333–2365) regarding these interactions. 
In those communications, Father first inquired about the status of his request 
and informed the court that the opposing party had been notified of the substance 
of the relief sought (R. 2338). The clerk advised that in-person presentation was 
required, and Father requested to appear between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. on March 28, 
2025, again confirming that the opposing party had been served (R. 2339). Father

the scheduling notice to reflect that agreement (R. 2360-2361). Father then 
proceeded to present the motion to the Honorable Kate Stone, who summarily 
declined to even hear it based solely on a prospective objection communicated by 
Mother’s counsel—who was not even present in court (R. 2352). Even the 
coordinator acknowledged that the motion could have been heard on the spot and 
noted that it could have been transferred after the emergency was addressed (R. 
2356). Instead, the Associate Judge declined entirely to entertain the motion, 
ultimately triggering cause number 25-0367, now pending before this Honorable 
Court. 
On April 1, 2025, Father filed a Pre-Objection in the 322nd court addressing 
opposing counsel’s anticipated motion to consolidate (R. 1889–1915). He also 
submitted a Respondent’s Statement in the 322nd District Court (R. 1916–1919) 
and a separate Petitioner’s Statement in the 233rd District Court (R. 1920–1928). 
Father then filed a Petitioner’s Notice in the 233rd, presenting a side-by-side 
analysis of the children’s best interests and relevant procedural considerations (R. 
1995–2004). 
On April 3, 2025, Roderick Marx filed the Motion to Consolidate on behalf 
of Mother’s counsel that had been used to block the emergency hearing in the 
322nd District Court, which failed to acknowledge Father’s prior objection (R.

10, 2025, from the available dates provided (R. 2358). The coordinator initialed
the scheduling notice to reflect that agreement (R. 2360-2361). Father then
proceeded to present the motion to the Honorable Kate Stone, who summarily
declined to even hear it based solely on a prospective objection communicated by
Mother’s counsel—who was not even present in court (R. 2352). Even the
coordinator acknowledged that the motion could have been heard on the spot and
noted that it could have been transferred after the emergency was addressed (R.

2366–2369). In response, Father filed a Pre-Objection to Transfer in the 233rd 
District Court (R. 2084–2087) realizing that the case would need to be transferred 
at some point along with a Notice of New Information advising the court that 
Mother was now engaged to Damen Kazlauskas—the individual with whom she 
exchanged extensive messages at the outset of this case (R. 2019–2024). Father 
also submitted a Comprehensive Legal Analysis in Support of Dismissal in the 
322nd District Court, setting forth grounds to dismiss the original divorce matter so 
that the SAPCR could proceed independently (R. 1975–1994). 
X. Three Concurrent Mandamus Petitions 
A few days later, Father filed a Notice of Intent to File Mandamus in the 
233rd District Court (R. 2065–2083) and a Notice of Intent to File Prohibition in 
the 322nd District Court (R. 2005–2018). On April 10, 2025, Father filed an 
Emergency Motion for Declaratory Relief (R. 1775–1786) and a Petition for Writ 
of Mandamus in the Second Court of Appeals, naming the Honorable Kate Stone 
as Respondent under cause number 02-25-00164-CV (“the SAPCR Mandamus”) 
(R. 2025–2052). Directly after this mandamus was submitted to the Second Court 
of Appeals, District Judge Kenneth Newell from the 233rd District Court sua 
sponte granted Mother’s Motion to Consolidate in the 233rd District Court and 
then filed it with the 322nd District Court. (R. 2392-2395). The following day, the

the 322nd District Court (R. 2005-2018). On April 10, 2025, Father filed an
Emergency Motion for Declaratory Relief (R. 1775-1786) and a Petition for Writ
of Mandamus in the Second Court of Appeals, naming the Honorable Kate Stone
as Respondent under cause number 02-25-00164-CV (“the SAPCR Mandamus’’)
(R. 2025-2052). Directly after this mandamus was submitted to the Second Court

first-filed petition (“the SAPCR mandamus’’) was denied per curiam in the Second

Court of Appeals. 
On April 15, 2025, Father filed a Dominant Jurisdiction Analysis in the 
322nd District Court (R. 2088–2100), along with a second memorandum titled 
Procedural Irregularities with Temporary Orders realizing that he was dealing with 
three potential abuses of discretion from three separate judges (R. 2172– 2202). 
That same day, Father filed a second Petition for Writ of Mandamus in the Second 
Court of Appeals, this time naming the Honorable Jeff Kaitcer as 
Respondent under cause number 02-25-00166-CV (“the Void Order Mandamus”) 
(R. 2396–2447) and filed an Emergency Motion for Stay to halt the proceedings 
given the extraordinary circumstances of this matter. (R. 2106–2123). See No. 02- 
25-00166-CV 
The following day, Father filed a third Petition for Writ of Mandamus, 
naming the Honorable Kenneth Newell as Respondent under cause number 02-25- 
00171-CV (“the Consolidation Mandamus”) for his arbitrary grant of Mother’s 
contested motion without a hearing (R. 2223–2253). On the same day, Father’s 
second mandamus petition was denied per curiam. By April 17, 2025, all three 
mandamus petitions had been denied per curiam, and Father moved for 
reconsideration en banc in all three matters (R. 2448–2467; R. 2203–2217; R. 
2155–2171), thus giving birth to the “Dragon in Triplicate” – three separate judges 
implicated in three distinct abuses of discretion within the same family law matter.

Y. The Sudden Move to Final Trial 
On April 23, 2025, with all three mandamus petitions pending, Father 
received a Notice of Court Proceeding scheduling a conference for April 29, 2025, 
purposed for setting the matter for final trial (R. 1772–1772). That same day, 
Father filed a formal objection to the setting (R. 2218–2222). The following day, 
Father’s first filed en banc motion for reconsideration (the “Void Order” 
mandamus) was denied per curiam by the appellate court. 
To address the unresolved issues regarding subject-matter jurisdiction over 
these orders, Father filed a Plea to the Jurisdiction asking the Honorable James 
Munford to clarify the legal basis for the current orders (R. 2468–2479). In a 
further effort to protect his procedural rights, Father filed a Second Motion to 
Recuse Judge Munford on April 25, 2025 (R. 1787–1859). Later that same day, 
Mother notified Father that the emergency circumstance which had formed the 
original basis for Father’s urgent push for the Emergency TRO petition had now 
materialized (R. 1766–1771). 
With this new development, Father filed a Notice of Non-Appearance and 
Objection to Trial Setting (R. 2480–2486) and amended his pending Motion to 
Recuse (R. 2487–2608). Despite the allegations and the procedural defects raised, 
Judge Munford declined to recuse himself for a second time without any 
substantive explanation (R. 2609–2613).

Separately, the Honorable Jeff Kaitcer—though not named in the recusal 
motion—filed a voluntary recusal from the case (R. 2614–2618). In response, 
Father filed an Objection to Procedural Handling of the Recusal Proceedings, 
explaining that Judge Kaitcer’s referral order was improper and specifically 
objected to the court coordinator managing the recusal process (R. 2619–2625). 
On May 1, 2025, the appellate court denied Father’s two remaining en banc 
motions per curiam (R. 2626-2627; 2628-2629). That same day, Father filed his 
second Petition for Writ of Mandamus before this Court under cause number 25-

cause number 25-0367 (R. 2875-2943), followed by a fourth on May 7, 2025, 
under cause number 25-0378 (R. 3167-3201).

An Order of Assignment was forwarded by the coordinator from the 
Honorable David L. Evans appointing Senior Chief Justice John Cayce to oversee 
the recusal matters on May 6, 2025 (R. 3148-3150). Because the Order of

reiterating the need for an emergency stay of the trial court proceedings (R. 3488-

objections regarding the involvement of the court coordinator and the Hon. Kaitcer 
motion which was never filed (R. 3506-3508). The next day, Father filed an 
emergency notice with the Court reiterating that the date by which he requested 
relief was approaching, and he reiterated the need for an emergency stay and 
reminded the Court that no opposition to the relief being sought had been raised. 
(R. 3501-3505). 
AB. Mandamus #4 
On May 19, 2025, the Father filed a Petition for Writ of Mandamus before 
this Court as an Original Proceeding which was docketed as case number 25-0426 
on the grounds that the Regional Presiding Judge’s refusal to comply with Rule 
18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure was an abuse of discretion (R. 3509-

(R. 3837-3876). The next day, Father filed an Emergency Motion to Stay

compound. (R. 3877-3896).

(R. 3901-3904). The next day, Father filed a Notice of Intent to File Mandamus, 
raising the issue “…that the record, on its face, demonstrates a clear deviation from

I. Introduction 
In the halls of justice, where the rights of parents and the welfare of children 
hang in delicate balance, this Court stands as the final guardian of due process and 
fundamental fairness. This Third Amended Motion to Consolidate presents not 
merely procedural irregularities, but a profound breakdown in the administration of 
justice that threatens the very foundation of family law in Texas—a breakdown 
that reveals a troubling reality: one parent can baselessly discredit another to their 
detriment, and for fourteen months, the wronged parent can receive no answers 
despite exhausting every possible judicial avenue. The record before this Court 
reveals a disturbing sequence of events where a father's constitutional rights to 
parent his children and maintain his home were systematically dismantled through 
a series of procedural maneuvers that evaded meaningful judicial review. At each 
critical juncture, decisions affecting the most intimate aspects of family life—
where a father lives, when he sees his children, how he maintains his livelihood— 
were made without proper evidentiary hearings, without findings of fact, and 
without the deliberative process that our constitution demands. All the while, the 
responsible party for this ordeal remains silent, protected by a system that has

I. Introduction

In the halls of justice, where the rights of parents and the welfare of children
hang in delicate balance, this Court stands as the final guardian of due process and
fundamental fairness. This Third Amended Motion to Consolidate presents not
merely procedural irregularities, but a profound breakdown in the administration of
justice that threatens the very foundation of family law in Texas—a breakdown
that reveals a troubling reality: one parent can baselessly discredit another to their
detriment, and for fourteen months, the wronged parent can receive no answers
despite exhausting every possible judicial avenue. The record before this Court
reveals a disturbing sequence of events where a father's constitutional rights to
parent his children and maintain his home were systematically dismantled through
a series of procedural maneuvers that evaded meaningful judicial review. At each
critical juncture, decisions affecting the most intimate aspects of family life—
where a father lives, when he sees his children, how he maintains his livelihood—
were made without proper evidentiary hearings, without findings of fact, and
without the deliberative process that our constitution demands. All the while, the
responsible party for this ordeal remains silent, protected by a system that has
failed to require accountability.

The consolidation of these mandamus petitions is not merely a matter of

judicial efficiency. It represents this Court's unique opportunity to address a pattern

37

of procedural irregularities that, when viewed collectively, reveal systemic failures 
that extend beyond the immediate parties.  
The issues presented touch upon fundamental questions that lie at the heart 
of this Court's constitutional oversight role: When does expedience in family court 
proceedings cross the line into due process violations? What safeguards must 
remain inviolate even in the emotionally charged atmosphere of divorce and 
custody disputes? How can courts balance the need for swift action with the 
imperative of thorough and fair adjudication? And perhaps most critically: How 
can our judicial system prevent the weaponization of family court processes to 
erase one parent from a child's life without justification?  
At stake are not only the rights of this Relator, but the integrity of a judicial 
process that thousands of Texas families rely upon during their most vulnerable 
moments. The children at the center of this case—like all children in similar 
proceedings—deserve a process that honors the Texas Family Code's mandate that 
their best interests remain paramount, a mandate that can only be fulfilled when 
both parents receive the full measure of procedural protections guaranteed by our 
constitution, and when the fostering of parental bonds is prioritized over their 
erasure.

II. Reasons for Consolidation 
 
When deciding whether to consolidate mandamus petitions, the Supreme 
Court of Texas evaluates several key factors to determine if consolidation would 
serve judicial efficiency and the interests of justice. Primary considerations include 
the significance of the legal issues to both the parties involved and Texas 
jurisprudence as a whole, as demonstrated in Elec. Reliability Council of Tex., Inc. 
v. Panda Power Generation Infrastructure Fund, LLC (In re Panda Power 
Infrastructure Fund, LLC), 619 S.W.3d 628 (Tex. 2021). The Court also weighs 
the significance of the issues, whether the petitions have important implications for 
the State’s jurisprudence, and whether consolidation would promote the fair and 
efficient handling of the matters, and whether it would serve the convenience of 
parties and witnesses. 
1. Importance of Issues to the Parties and State Jurisprudence 
A primary reason for the Supreme Court of Texas to consolidate mandamus 
petitions is the significance of the legal issues to both the parties and the state's 
jurisprudence. This was clearly demonstrated in  In re Panda Power Infrastructure 
Fund, LLC, where the Court explicitly stated: "We granted review and 
consolidated the two causes because these issues—which include whether the 
Texas Public Utility Commission has exclusive jurisdiction over Panda's claims 
and whether sovereign immunity applies to ERCOT and protects it from Panda's

628 (Tex. 2021) 
This passage reveals that the Court considers two dimensions of importance 
when deciding to consolidate: (1) the significance to the specific parties involved 
in the litigation, and (2) the broader impact on Texas jurisprudence. When 
mandamus petitions raise questions that have far-reaching implications for Texas 
law or involve fundamental jurisdictional questions, the Court may be more 
inclined to consolidate them to ensure consistent, comprehensive treatment of these 
significant legal issues. 
2. Constitutional Oversight of the Administration of Justice 
The Supreme Court's constitutional role in overseeing the administration of 
justice in Texas is another factor that may influence its consolidation decisions. 
In In re McAllen Medical Center, Inc., 275 S.W.3d 458 (Tex. 2008), the Court 
recognized that "harm to the judicial system, affecting our constitutional obligation 
to oversee the administration of justice and the rights of all Texans to a fair and 
efficient judicial system, is a basis for acting by mandamus."

III. Application of Key Consolidation Factors 
 
The matters before this court, in totality, highlight a rare, and perhaps 
historic, opportunity to showcase the integrity of the Judicial system in Texas. As 
mentioned in the Hon. Stone Mandamus:  
“This Court's intervention is necessary not only to rectify the specific 
injustice suffered by Relator and his children but also to reaffirm the 
fundamental principle that Texas courts must provide a meaningful forum 
for litigants, especially in emergencies involving child safety, and must 
perform their ministerial duties without bias or arbitrary refusal.” 25-0367 at 
p. 16-17. 
A. Importance of Issues to the Parties and State Jurisprudence  
The five mandamus petitions raise issues of profound importance both to the 
parties involved and to Texas jurisprudence as a whole. As articulated in In re 
Panda Power Infrastructure Fund, LLC, 619 S.W.3d 628 (Tex. 2021), the 
Court considers "issues... important to the parties and to our state's 
jurisprudence" as primary factors favoring consolidation. For the Relator, these 
petitions collectively represent his only pathway to meaningful judicial review 
after fourteen months of procedural obstacles. Each petition addresses a distinct 
but interconnected procedural irregularity that has prevented adjudication on the 
merits: The 25-0426 mandamus addresses improper recusal procedures that 
violated Rule 18a; the 25-0367 challenges judicial inaction on emergency

motions affecting parental rights; the 25-0361 mandamus questions the 
authority of an associate judge to issue orders without written agreement or 
unrevoked waiver; the 25-0378 mandamus challenges improper case 
consolidation conducted without notice or hearing and in violation of local 
rules; and the 25-0458 mandamus addresses summary denial of recusal through 
the selective use of Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.  
These issues transcend the individual case and implicate fundamental 
questions of Texas jurisprudence, including: The proper implementation of 
recusal procedures under Rule 18a; The ministerial duty of courts to hear 
properly filed emergency motions; The scope of associate judge authority under 
Texas Family Code; The requirements for proper consolidation under local 
rules; and The protection of fundamental parental rights in Texas family courts. 
As noted in the Stone Mandamus, these issues reflect broader systemic 
concerns in Texas family courts, where a 2020 Texas Home School Coalition 
analysis found courts "failed to protect parents' constitutional rights more than 
78% of the time" in certain contested suits. This statistical evidence elevates 
these petitions beyond individual grievances to matters of statewide 
jurisprudential significance.

B. Constitutional Oversight of the Administration of Justice

The Supreme Court's decision in McAllen "constitutional obligation to

oversee the administration of justice and the rights of all Texans to a fair and 
efficient judicial system" provides another compelling reason for consolidation. 
The five mandamus petitions collectively reveal a pattern of procedural 
irregularities that have effectively denied the Relator access to meaningful 
judicial review for fourteen months. As noted in the Stone Mandamus, recent 
signals point to declining public confidence in Texas courts, with polls 
suggesting "current trust/satisfaction is significantly lower – in the mid-40s to 
50s percentage range." See 25-0367 mandamus at p. 10.  
Addressing these interconnected procedural issues through consolidated 
review would serve the Court's constitutional interest in maintaining public 
confidence in the judiciary. The five mandamus petitions share a common 
factual background, involving the same parties and underlying family law 
dispute, and all stem from the same litigant seeking un-opposed relief. 
If mandamus were ever appropriate – it is here that at the very least, proper 
legal analyzation should occur given the extraordinary circumstances before 
this Court. Below are some visual maps, including FIGURE 1 that highlights 
each issue raised across all five mandamus petitions, and how they all share two 
common threads: the lack of an appellate remedy, and an abuse of discretion 
through due process concerns.

IV. Silence as the Opponent
In addition to the overlapping factual context and legal standards at issue, 
these proceedings share another unifying feature: a complete lack of opposition. At 
every level—trial, appellate, and now before this Court—the Real Party in Interest 
has failed to file a single substantive response disputing the factual record or 
contesting the relief sought. This prolonged and unexplained silence, despite 
repeated service and opportunity, underscores the procedural breakdown at issue 
and heightens the urgency of a coordinated judicial response. Consolidation would 
allow the Court to address these unanswered legal questions comprehensively, 
ensure consistent treatment, and safeguard the fundamental rights at stake without 
risking fractured outcomes or duplicative rulings. 
This silence is not merely procedural—it is constitutional in consequence. 
For more than a year, the Real Party in Interest has prosecuted no claims, 
responded to no motions, and filed no evidence in rebuttal to the numerous, well-
documented pleadings presented by the Relator. Despite being served with 
dispositive motions, sworn declarations, discovery requests, and appellate filings, 
there has been no meaningful participation in the adversarial process. Such a 
lopsided posture, absent corrective review, risks normalizing default governance 
without due process—a result that the Texas Constitution does not permit and this 
Honorable Court has the exclusive power to rectify.

IV. Conclusion 
 
The consolidation of these mandamus petitions presents this Court with an 
opportunity to address a pattern of procedural irregularities that, when viewed 
collectively, reveal systemic failures in the administration of justice and raise 
questions of substantial importance.  
The party responsible for this ordeal remains silent, but this Court need not 
be. It can speak clearly to affirm that in Texas, justice requires more than 
procedural expediency—it requires meaningful hearings, evidentiary findings, and 
the preservation of parental bonds absent clear and convincing evidence that those 
bonds should be severed. The abuse of protective orders should not be taken lightly 
by this Court. Does an intentional disruption of the parent-child bond constitute 
family violence? In this instance, the Relator contends that it does. 
For these reasons, Father respectfully requests that this Court grant the 
Motion to Consolidate these mandamus petitions and provide the emergency relief 
necessary to protect the fundamental rights at stake while these important issues 
are considered, such as granting the pending motion(s) to stay in cases 25-0361 
and 25-0426. 
The Relator, at the very least, deserves to regain what was taken from him – 
his home, his children, his business – and be provided with an equal say in the 
dissolution of his marriage that will serve the best interests of his children.

If there were ever a time for this Court to grant relief, it is now—before the 
Court's recess and during the children's summer break. This timing is not merely a 
matter of convenience but of profound significance for this family's healing. 
Granting relief now would allow Father to return home and be with his children 
every day while Mother works. If Mother chooses to reside elsewhere, that is her 
prerogative, but she should not be rewarded for manipulating the legal process, 
making no opposition to Father's legitimate concerns, and then benefiting from that 
silence. The judicial system must not incentivize such tactics, which undermine the 
very foundation of adversarial proceedings designed to uncover truth. 
V. Prayer
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Relator Charles Dustin Myers 
respectfully prays that this Honorable Court: 
1. GRANT this Third Amended Motion to Consolidate the five pending 
mandamus proceedings (Cause Nos. 25-0361, 25-0367, 25-0378, 25-0426, 
and 25-0458) into the first filed case of 25-0361;
2. ISSUE an emergency stay as soon as possible pursuant to Texas Rule of 
Appellate Procedure 52.10(a) to preserve the status quo while this Court 
considers the consolidated petitions;
3. GRANT such other and further relief to which Relator may show himself 
justly entitled.
