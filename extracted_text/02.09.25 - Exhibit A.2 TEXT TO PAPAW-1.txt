Hey.. we need to talk tomorrow.
All of us.

Our kids lives and stability are at risk

been deeply remorseful, and thought
everything was fine.

| was finally going to be ready to pay you all a fair amount
of rent as I'm grateful for the help you've provided over the
years, and have always anticipated paying it forward.

Morgan told me the things she wanted the most were to
move away from the house and be a stay at home mom...
she's always said this house is "cursed" and empowered me
to work hard to "get us out" although | never really knew how
that would.happen - because the kids are blessed with their
great grandparents next door and their two parents at home.

0.75% of all kids on Earth have it this good
| Know | haven't been the most active guy in the family

| know i may be alittle weird, and sometimes may do things
or not do things that Morgan needs.

But | know for certain that | love those two kids, you and your
family, and have always wanted to provide- something that
I've struggled with up until recently.

Sorry for the novel. | felt you deserved to know.

I'm not going to involve anyone but family in this.. and

you're the first person that knows what's going on outside of
Morgan and her friends.. and possibly Caitlin but I'm not sure
100%.

Again, felt you deserved to know because if it doesn't end

up being resolved, then | want to ensure we do everything
the right way and in a way that has as little effect on the little
ones as possible.

But yeah- just a heads up. Morgan may try to come and tell
you all what's going on tomorrow.

It's breaking my heart what's going on and how she's saying
she's been feeling.

If | would have known earlier - and not felt everything
was OK based on everything.. | would've worked on it. |
recommended counseling - she shot it down.

Hey.. we need to talk tomorrow.

All of us.

Our kids lives and stability are at risk here.

Morgan blindsided me with a divorce the other day.

She said she hasn't been happy. I've been deeply remorseful,
and thought everything was fine.

She's being very mean, and I'm not sure what's going on with
her.

I'm really worried about her, and have told her I'd do anything
to work on what's needed but she won't have any of it.

She's done and has no plan.. and all I'm doing is sitting here
thinking.. ok.. how will you get to work? (I would have to
return the lease cause | wouldn't be able to afford two car
payments)

she'd have to pick up more hours.. losing precious time
with the kids.. the kids wouldn't have mommy and daddy in
the same house.. something that we both vowed we would
always try to work on before calling it quits.

She's completely dead set on this and if this is what she
really wants.. at least do.it the right way and let me help her
get a car, wait for her to get a full time Job.. and be civil and
try to work on ourselves in the process.. and if it works out
great but if not at least we can say we tried for our kids sake.

I've said exactly what I've told you to her.. but she just comes
back with anger and doesnt believe I'll change the things that
are making her feel this way.. which seems to change every
day.

I'm willing to fight for us, for the kids. Always. She really had
me thinking everything was fine and then boom... its all at
risk right here when we should.be planning our Christmas
together.

| just am worried and hope she will slow down a bit and work
with me here.

This is all too beautiful to throw away.

I'm willing to do my part.
