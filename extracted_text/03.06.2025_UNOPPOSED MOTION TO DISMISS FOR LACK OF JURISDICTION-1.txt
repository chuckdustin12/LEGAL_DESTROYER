TO THE HONORABLE COURT:
COMES NOW, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, Respondent, appearing pro se, and

files this Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction, respectfully stating as follows:

I. STATEMENT OF FACTS

1. Respondent removed this case to the United States District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
§$1446(d) on December 2, 2024, immediately suspending state court jurisdiction upon

removal.

2. Following subsequent remand from the federal court, jurisdiction would only resume in

state court upon filing a certified Notice of Remand pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1447(c).

3. No such certified Notice of Remand has been filed with the Clerk of this Court as

required by federal law, nor has Respondent been properly served with such notice.

4. Petitioner and her counsel are procedurally unable to file or serve the required certified
Notice of Remand electronically through the mandated Electronic Filing Manager
("EFM"), violating mandatory filing and service procedures as required by Texas Rule of
Civil Procedure 21(f).
5. Additionally, current judicial recusal proceedings under Texas Rules of Civil Procedure
18a and 18b place jurisdictional authority for administrative issues with the Regional
Presiding Judge, suspending any substantive authority by the trial court pending
resolution.
6. Due to these facts, state court jurisdiction remains suspended and cannot lawfully
proceed.
7. Because COOPER L. CARTER cannot properly serve documents via the electronic filing
manager as required by law, she is unable to fulfill her obligations pursuant to Tex. R.
Civ. P. 237a.
8. Because COOPER L. CARTER cannot oppose this motion, it should be granted
immediately and without the necessity of a hearing given all facts presented herein are
undisputed.
REQUEST FOR RELIEF 
WHEREFORE, Respondent respectfully requests that this Court: 
1. GRANT this Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction, without hearing, as the
jurisdictional facts and law are undisputed and clearly evidenced in the existing record;
2. Dismiss all current actions and filings due to suspended jurisdiction; and
