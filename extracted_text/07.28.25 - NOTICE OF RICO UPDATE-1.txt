TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT:

Respondent CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS respectfully submits this RICO UPDATE to
this Court to provide recent updates regarding concurrent Federal litigation closely related to the
instant proceedings and shows this Court the following:

I. Introduction
1. As an initial reminder, this divorce matter was initiated on December 18, 2023, and an

application for a protective order followed on December 22, 2023.

2. On January 16, 2024, the parties named herein appeared before the Court, where the
Respondent was ordered to vacate the family residence prior to any evidentiary hearing taking
place, and the setting concluded without the required findings mandated by the Texas Family

Code.

3. As this Court and staff are well aware – a litigant cannot be deprived of fundamental 
rights prior to being afforded an equal opportunity to be heard, and all custody determinations 
must be in the best interests of the Children involved.  
 
4. Despite these prohibited actions, this Court shelved both of these requirements, and 
helped participate in the destruction of the status quo and the emotional and financial stability of 
the two minor children involved. 
 
5. With nothing other than the claims of the Petitioner to go off of, this Court and its’ staff 
continues to disregard basic principles of Texas law for reasons that cannot be determined from 
the case documents itself. 
 
6. This has lead to the Respondent seeking answers throughout the Texas Judiciary for the 
prior 18 months only to received unexplained denials and refusals to take action by our State’s 
highest Court.  
 
7. Notably, these denials do not disprove the Respondent’s legal position, or imply that he 
is incorrect in his claims. 
 
8. Due to this Court and the opposing counsel’s inaction, Respondent has taken matters 
into his own hands and seeks to hold the Petitioner accountable for her actions leading up to the 
initiation of this divorce suit, which is being prosecuted in the Western District of Oklahoma. 1 
 
9. This case must be dismissed as it has no path towards a lawful resolution.

II. RICO Developments 
 
10. On July 24, 2025, Petitioner Morgan Michelle Myers filed a pro-se Motion to 
Dismiss in federal court, claiming that the allegations raised in the complaint are domestic issues, 
and requested the case be dismissed. 
 
11. At the same time, Petitioner hides behind her alleged attorney here in this matter, and 
has not prosecuted the case in over 12 months. This Court and its’ reviewing staff must ask 
themselves: why can she participate pro-se in federal court, but remains absolutely silent here in 
this Court? 
 
12. The answer is simple: because she has no valid legal representation, and this Court 
knows that. 
III. Analysis 
 
13. In a normal case with a fair and impartial tribunal, the consequences for an attorney 
not prosecuting a divorce case for over 12 months can be severe. Under Rule 165a of the Texas 
Rules of Civil Procedure, courts have authority to dismiss cases that are not disposed of within 
the Supreme Court's time standards. Additionally, courts possess inherent power to dismiss cases 
not prosecuted with due diligence. When a case has been dormant for an extended period without 
reasonable explanation, courts may presume abandonment and dismiss the case for want of 
prosecution, though the attorney may have an opportunity to reinstate the case by showing good 
cause for the delay. 
 
14. Not only has Respondent repeatedly brought this to the Court’s attention, but he has 
also filed a Motion to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution which this Court has the inherent power 
to set at any time given the delay in prosecution by our friends on the other side.

15. Courts in Texas have authority to dismiss cases for want of prosecution from two 
primary sources: Rule 165a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and the court's inherent power. 
A. Rule 165a Dismissal 
 
16. Rule 165a explicitly authorizes courts to dismiss cases that are not disposed of within 
the time standards promulgated by the Supreme Court. According to Villarreal v. San Antonio 
Truck & Equip., 994 S.W.2d 628, 42 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 662 (Tex. 1999), "A trial court may dismiss 
under Rule 165a on 'failure of any party seeking affirmative relief to appear for any hearing or 
trial of which the party had notice,' TEX. R. CIV. P. 165a(1), or when a case is 'not disposed of 
within the time standards promulgated by the Supreme Court....'". This latter provision, found in 
Rule 165a(2), is particularly relevant to cases that have been dormant for extended periods, such 
as those not prosecuted for over 12 months, which is the case here. 
17. Furthermore, Whallon v. Candlelight Trails I Ass'n, NO. 01-18-00493-CV (Tex. App. 
Nov 14, 2019) reiterates this authority: "A trial court may dismiss a suit under Rule 165a if (1) a 
party seeking affirmative relief fails to appear for any hearing or trial of which the party had 
notice or (2) the case is not disposed of within the time standards promulgated by the Texas 
Supreme Court under its administrative rules." The question remains: why does this Court 
continue to permit this behavior to continue, and what incentive is the Court operating under that 
is permitting such blatant misconduct to persist, and why has it not utilized its’ inherent power to 
restore justice to these proceedings? 
B. Inherent Power to Dismiss 
 
18. In addition to the explicit authority granted by Rule 165a, courts also have inherent 
power to dismiss cases that are not prosecuted with due diligence. Whallon v. Candlelight Trails 
--- OCR TEXT ---
15. Courts in Texas have authority to dismiss cases for want of prosecution from two

primary sources: Rule 165a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and the court's inherent power.

A. Rule 165a Dismissal

16. Rule 165a explicitly authorizes courts to dismiss cases that are not disposed of within
the time standards promulgated by the Supreme Court. According to Villarreal v. San Antonio
Truck & Equip., 994 S.W.2d 628, 42 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 662 (Tex. 1999), "A trial court may dismiss
under Rule 165a on 'failure of any party seeking affirmative relief to appear for any hearing or
trial of which the party had notice,' TEX. R. CIV. P. 165a(1), or when a case is ‘not disposed of
within the time standards promulgated by the Supreme Court...."". This latter provision, found in
Rule 165a(2), is particularly relevant to cases that have been dormant for extended periods, such

as those not prosecuted for over 12 months, which is the case here.

17. Furthermore, Whallon v. Candlelight Trails I Ass'n, NO. 01-18-00493-CV (Tex. App.
Nov 14, 2019) reiterates this authority: "A trial court may dismiss a suit under Rule 165a if (1) a
party seeking affirmative relief fails to appear for any hearing or trial of which the party had
notice or (2) the case is not disposed of within the time standards promulgated by the Texas
Supreme Court under its administrative rules." The question remains: why does this Court
continue to permit this behavior to continue, and what incentive is the Court operating under that
is permitting such blatant misconduct to persist, and why has it not utilized its’ inherent power to

restore justice to these proceedings?

B. Inherent Power to Dismiss

18. In addition to the explicit authority granted by Rule 165a, courts also have inherent

power to dismiss cases that are not prosecuted with due diligence. Whallon v. Candlelight Trails

=== PAGE 5 ===

I Ass'n, NO. 01-18-00493-CV (Tex. App. Nov 14, 2019) states that "A trial court's authority to 
dismiss a suit for want of prosecution arises from: (1) Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 165a and 
(2) the trial court's inherent authority to control its own docket." This inherent power exists 
independently of the procedural rules. 
19. Villarreal v. San Antonio Truck & Equip., 994 S.W.2d 628, 42 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 662 
(Tex. 1999), a seminal case on this issue, clearly establishes that "The trial court's authority to 
dismiss for want of prosecution stems from two sources: (1) Rule 165a of the Texas Rules of 
Civil Procedure, and (2) the court's inherent power." 
20. Jimenez v Transwestern Property Co., 999 S.W.2d 125 (Tex. Ct. App. 1999) further 
explains: "Trial courts possess inherent and express power to dismiss cases that have not been 
prosecuted with diligence. See Rotello, 671 S.W.2d at 509. In a dismissal for want of 
prosecution, the test is not abandonment; the test is due diligence." This highlights that the key 
consideration is whether the attorney has demonstrated due diligence in prosecuting the case, not 
whether the case has been explicitly abandoned.  
21. When a case has been inactive for an extended period, courts may presume that the 
plaintiff has abandoned the suit. Roush v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., No. 07-17-00458-CV (Tex. App. 
Feb 26, 2019) explains that "A delay of unreasonable duration, if not reasonably explained, will 
give rise to a conclusive presumption that the plaintiff abandoned the suit." This presumption 
then justifies dismissal under either Rule 165a or the court's inherent power.  
22. Despite this capability, this Court only seems interested in prolonging the matter 
indefinitely, allowing the non-prosecution to leave the parties in legal limbo, and refuses to 
require any form of written participation from the other side.

III. Conclusion 
 
23. In the beginning, this Court reversed the burden of proof and placed the burden on the 
Respondent to show why he should not have a protective order issued against him. Now, rather 
than the opposing counsel having the burden of showing good cause for the unreasonable delay in 
this case, the Court continues to sit on its’ hands, allowing more precious time to be wasted, judicial 
resources to be consumed, and with no final resolution possible that would comport with Texas 
Law. 
 
24. As the case continues to languish, this notice is a reminder that despite the inaction 
here, the Respondent is doing everything he can – in every forum that he can – to ensure that justice 
is served to himself, his children, and that the Petitioner is held accountable for her egregious 
actions that are the foundation of this case. 
 
Respectfully submitted.
