Affidavit

THE STATE OF _ Texas
COUNTY OF __Dalla

The person who signed this affidavit, appeared in person, before me, the

undersigned notary, and stated under oath:

Christian Michael Vroom

| am of sound mind and capable of making this statement. | have personal knowledge of
the facts written in this statement. | understand that if | lie in this statement, | may be held

criminally responsible. This statement is true and correct.

I'm signing this affidavit to attest to the work ethic and
dedication of Charles Myers. I've come to rely on the
services he provides in order to gather the required data to
make educated decisions on what and when to enter/exit
options positions. Recently due to him not being at his
normal location of operations the services have had multiple
down times in which Charles was not in a position to be able
to remedy. Some of these down times have led to significant
losses due to making decisions without the necessary data
after already being entered in a position.

My name is

a etttee,
setae eles,

Charles' work ethic is unlike anything I've seen in anyone
ver met and h verything for the future of hi
family. I'm constantly amazed at the feats he is able to pull
off as a one man show. Some things he is able to create

| didn't think were possible but he figures it out through

his endless research and personal development efforts.
Again, everything I've seen him do, he does to give his

irls the best life he can and wants the world for them.
I've seen videos of him with his children out at man |
different parks/recreational areas and | can tell that the |

;

love their father to death and that he would die for them.
| hope his situation is resolved for not only my benefit but
for the sakes of his children and the life he is trying to

provide them with. Charles Myers is both a good person and

amazing father and | would hate to see him and his daughters
robbed of the life he is building that they need and deserve.

Signed this 10th day of
