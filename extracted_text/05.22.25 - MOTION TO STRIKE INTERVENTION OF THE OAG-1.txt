As clarified in Guaranty Federal Sav. Bank v. Horseshoe Operating Co., 793 S.W.2d 652 
(Tex. 1990), "the party who opposed the intervention has the burden to challenge it by a motion 
to strike." Here, the Respondent is challenging the OAG’s involvement in this matter and 
requests clarification on their role in the litigation. By following clearly established Texas 
prescedent and utilizing the  
II. LEGAL ANALYSIS 
The right to intervene in Texas is governed primarily by Rule 60 of the Texas Rules of 
Civil Procedure. This rule provides that: "Any party may intervene by filing a pleading, subject 
to being stricken out by the court for sufficient cause on the motion of any party." In re R.M., No. 
05-18-01127-CV (Tex. App. May 24, 2019); Smith v. City of Garland, 523 S.W.3d 234 (Tex. 
App. 2017); R. Hassell & Co. v. Springwoods Realty Co., NO. 01-17-00154-CV (Tex. App. Apr 
19, 2018). 
This rule establishes that while intervention is permitted as a matter of right, it is not 
absolute and remains subject to judicial oversight. The Texas Supreme Court has clarified that 
Rule 60 "authorizes a party with a justiciable interest in a pending suit to intervene in the suit as 
a matter of right." In re Union Carbide Corp., 273 S.W.3d 152, 154 (Tex. 2008). However, this 
right is balanced against the court's obligation to ensure the efficient administration of justice. 
A. The Justiciable Interest Requirement 
For an intervention to be sustained, the intervenor must demonstrate a "justiciable 
interest" in the pending suit. This requirement serves as a threshold that must be met before a 
court will allow an outside party to join ongoing litigation. According to Texas courts, an 
intervenor has a justiciable interest in a lawsuit "when his interests will be affected by the 
litigation." Brown v. Freed, 03-21-00556-CV (Tex. App. May 10, 2023). This interest may be

"legal or equitable in nature." Brown v. Freed (Tex. App. Aug. 1, 2023) (citing Mendez v. 
Brewer, 626 S.W.2d 498, 499 (Tex. 1982)). 
B. Procedure for Challenging an Intervention  
An important procedural aspect of Rule 60 is that an intervenor is not required to secure 
the court's permission before intervening. Rather, "the party who opposed the intervention has 
the burden to challenge it by a motion to strike." Guaranty Federal Sav. Bank v. Horseshoe 
Operating Co., 793 S.W.2d 652 (Tex. 1990); Musick v. Zamora, 03-21-00555-CV (Tex. App. Apr 
27, 2023) (citing Guaranty Fed., 793 S.W.2d at 657). 
Once a motion to strike is filed, "the burden shifts to the intervenor to show a justiciable 
interest in the lawsuit." R. Hassell & Co. v. Springwoods Realty Co., NO. 01-17-00154-CV (Tex. 
App. Apr 19, 2018) (citing Union Carbide, 273 S.W.3d at 155); In re R.M., No. 05-18-01127-CV 
(Tex. App. May 24, 2019) (citing In re Union Carbide Corp., 273 S.W.3d 152, 155 (Tex. 2008)). 
C. Burden on the OAG 
Because a motion to strike has now been filed in this case, the burden would shift to the 
OAG to demonstrate a justiciable interest in the litigation sufficient to overcome concerns about 
delay or prejudice. As established in In re R.M., No. 05-18-01127-CV (Tex. App. May 24, 
2019) and R. Hassell & Co. v. Springwoods Realty Co., NO. 01-17-00154-CV (Tex. App. Apr 19, 
2018), "the intervenor bears the burden to demonstrate a justiciable interest in the pending suit." 
Here, the OAG would need to articulate how its interests will be affected by the litigation 
and why its continued involvement is necessary despite its lack of action. If the OAG cannot 
demonstrate a sufficient justiciable interest, or if the court determines that any such interest is 
outweighed by the delay or prejudice being caused, the court would have grounds to strike the 
intervention.

III. APPLICATION 
The three-pronged test established in Guaranty Federal Savings Bank v. Horseshoe 
Operating Co., 793 S.W.2d 652, 657 (Tex. 1990) provides a framework for this analysis. An 
intervenor must show that (1) it could have brought the same action, or any part thereof, in its 
own name, or if the action had been brought against it, it would be able to defeat recovery; (2) 
the intervention will not complicate the case by an excessive multiplication of the issues; and (3) 
the intervention is almost essential to effectively protect the intervenor's interest. 
This framework should be applied within the instant matter in the court’s determination 
of whether to strike the intervention of the Office of the Attorney General. In the interest of 
judicial economy, the Respondent objects to any settings on this matter until the Office of the 
Attorney General furnishes a written response.  
CONCLUSION AND PRAYER 
For all the reasons stated herein, the Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, 
respectfully requests that this Honorable Court: 
1. Request a response from Holly Hayes, and request that she demonstrate a justiciable 
interest in this matter and clarify the undue delay lack of participation in the 
proceedings; 
2. If a justiciable interest cannot be demonstrated or if a response is not filed by a future 
date deemed appropriate by the Court, order that the intervention pleading from the 
Office of the Attorney General naming Holly Hayes as counsel be stricken from the 
record; 
3. Grant any other relief that the Court deems just and proper under the circumstances. 
Respectfully submitted,
