Good Evening,
I have received communication from opposing party who is pro se that he will be walking through an Emergency TRO.
Our office has a hearing scheduled for tomorrow morning in Parker County and is unable to attend. However, I will be
available by cell phone regarding this matter if the Judge would like to speak to me regarding the Emergency TRO.
Please contact our office to patch me in for any calls that Judge would like to have.
Additionally, this case already is pending in the 322nd for a divorce proceeding regarding property and children matters.
We will be consolidating the case and walking it through the 322nd for signature next week.
Thank you,
Cooper L. Carter

Court staff,
Ms. Carter’s recent correspondence is improper for several reasons, and appears to be an attempt to delay or interfere
with proceedings in which she has otherwise failed to meaningfully participate in. The following reasons support this
statement:
1. An objection to consolidation is already on file and remains unopposed. It cites controlling Texas precedent. Any
suggestion that consolidation is agreed upon or inevitable is misleading. Instead, she should properly file with the court
why the consolidation is improper or at the very least argue against Petitioner's position.
2. Ms. Carter has not fulfilled her obligation under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 237a to file a Notice of Remand. Until
she does, she is prohibited from proceeding or filing anything in the 322nd District Court as they currently do not have
jurisdiction over this matter until this obligation is fulfilled.
3. Her authority to represent the Respondent remains under challenge pursuant to a Rule 12 motion filed September 20,
2024. No hearing has been held, no written statement of authority has been filed, and no ruling has been made. Until
resolved, Rule 12 bars her from participating in either proceeding.
4. Ms. Carter has not prosecuted the case in the 322nd District Court in over eight months. This inaction has prejudiced
the Petitioner and delayed resolution of urgent matters affecting the children.
5. She has failed to file any objections, responsive pleadings, or legal arguments opposing the relief requested—including
the Emergency TRO now pending.
6. Rather than reaching out to Petitioner to resolve any scheduling conflict, Ms. Carter improperly attempted to influence
the court by email. This violates the spirit of cooperation required by the rules, particularly where her participation is
procedurally barred.
7. Ms. Carter’s conduct appears designed to delay relief and subvert the best interest of the children, despite her failure to
oppose the requested relief in any meaningful way.
8. She has been provided with full notice of the Emergency TRO, the proposed order, supporting exhibits, and the time
and location of presentment. She has no legal basis to subvert Petitioner's due process rights.
In summary, Ms. Carter has not provided anything of substance in either Court, has not prosecuted the case, has not
argued on behalf of her client, or followed proper procedure.
Simply labeling the opposition as pro se and claiming that the consolidation will be filed without disclosing the above facts
is dishonest and should not be permitted as it will only cause further unnecessary delays to the relief being sought without
any substance being provided.
Again, all of these points have been argued in both courts, and it is her duty as counsel to handle these matters in
accordance with Texas Law.
These matters should be handled between the parties - not attempt to influence court staff after hours.
The reason we are here in the first place is due to the above unanswered facts. Ms. Carter has had ample time to file an
objection, response, or counter argument, but has chosen not to do so.
It would've been far more appropriate for Ms. Carter to have reached out to me directly to discuss scheduling conflicts.
Prior to the latest email, there was no indication Ms. Carter intended to participate at all despite being provided with all
relevant materials.

Mr. Myers appeared before me to schedule the hearing for the TRO; my apologies I did not realize this was that
