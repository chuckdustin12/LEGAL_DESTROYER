NO. 322-744263-23 
IN THE 322ND DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
FOREWORD 
On January 16th, 2024, amid inclement weather, the Respondent was 
ordered to vacate the residency at a show cause hearing for an order of protection 
where a continuance was granted, and cause number 322-744263-23 was 
consolidated with cause number 322-744538-23 on the court’s own motion, and 
the case was reset to January 22nd, 2024, and then again for February 1st, 2024, 
where a settlement agreement was quickly drafted and Respondent was advised 
to sign it by his former counsel.  
This led to the subsequent termination of counsel, leaving Respondent to 
request an emergency hearing to vacate the associate judge’s report for temporary 
orders, which was the only hearing to date in this case after eight months. 
The unusual circumstances surrounding the initiation of this case warrant 
the court's reconsideration of the Respondent's original answer and subsequent 
briefs1 filed before the initial setting. Given the evolving facts and the clear 
foresight demonstrated in these earlier submissions, Respondent respectfully 
urges the court to revisit these filings in the interest of ensuring a just resolution.

CONCLUSION 
The Petitioner appeared before this Court on December 14, 2023, 
requesting an ex-parte temporary order of protection, and subsequently filed a 
protective order on December 22, 2023. The Respondent contends that the 
Petitioner's narrative is an attempt to avoid accountability for her extramarital 
affairs which was discovered just prior to the initiation of her pleadings. 
While the Petitioner engaged in activities outside the marriage, the 
Respondent remained at home caring for the children. During the time the 
Petitioner pursued legal actions shortly before Christmas, the Respondent was 
preparing for the children's holiday. Since taking residence in the family home, the 
Petitioner has reportedly moved in her sister, reduced her employment to three 
hours per day, failed to complete the court-ordered parenting course, and is not 
contributing rent to her grandmother. The Respondent asserts that there is 
sufficient evidence on record to substantiate these claims, and predicted this exact 
outcome within his first pleadings within the clerk’s record, attached hereto. 
The Respondent believes that this case has been conducted in the best 
interest of the Petitioner rather than the children, a concern that has been 
repeatedly raised without response. The current orders in place are lack lawful 
foundation, and there has been minimal meaningful engagement from the 
Petitioner's attorney. The Respondent is concerned about the ongoing financial

erosion affecting the children's well-being and sees no logical basis to consider the 
existing arrangements as serving their best interests. 
Granting this motion would initiate a long-overdue healing process. The 
Petitioner should be required to explain her actions and be held accountable. The 
Respondent emphasizes the critical need for access to the residence to provide for 
the children while seeking alternative accommodations nearby. This need is

consequences of her own actions.

decision that genuinely serves the best interests of the children.

pay rent, hasn’t completed her responsibilities for the Children, and has reduced

So long as the Children are in Father’s care and he is given a fair amount of

prays that this Court will consider the totality of the case, and rule in his favor.

PRAYER FOR EXPEDITED RELIEF 
Respondent requests the following expedited relief: 
1.      Vacate the current orders, which were entered in violation of 
the Respondent's right to due process and a fair hearing. These 
orders were rendered as "agreed" without the Respondent's 
consent and are unsupported by any motion that was properly 
served on him. 
2.      Grant the Respondent's motion for temporary orders without 
notice or hearing to the Petitioner, restoring the status quo for the 
children and enabling the Respondent to meet his financial 
obligations related to the Children and allow healing to begin. 
3.      Provide a provision allowing the Respondent to return to the 
residence at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, TX 76148 where he was 
wrongfully removed including the option for Petitioner to reside 
there as well if she so chooses. 
4. Strike all pleadings from the Respondent other than the Rule 12 
motion to show authority and the summary judgement motion in 
the interest of judicial economy. 
5.      Grant any further relief that this Court finds equitable, just, 
and appropriate so that we may finally get this case headed 
in the right direction and in alignment with the Children’s 
best interest.

Background Report for Case Consolidation

Case Details:

Divorce Case (Cause No. 322-744263-23) in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County, filed on
December 18, 2023.

Protective Order Case (Cause No. 322-744538-23) in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County.

Reasons for Consolidation:

Interconnected Issues:

The divorce case and the protective order case involve overlapping issues concerning family violence
allegations, which are central to the divorce proceedings and directly affect custody and visitation rights.
The protective order case includes allegations of family violence, which are also a pivotal point in the
divorce case in determining the waiver of the standard waiting period for the divorce.

Consistency in Rulings:

Consolidating the divorce and protective order cases would ensure consistency in the court's findings,
particularly regarding any allegations of family violence and their impact on the dissolution of marriage,
custody, and visitation rights.

Judicial Economy:

Hearing both cases together would promote judicial economy by avoiding duplication of legal
proceedings, as both cases are likely to involve similar witnesses, evidence, and legal arguments.

Claims of False Statements:

There have been claims of false statements and perjury related to the protective order, which could have
significant implications for the divorce case. For instance, the claim that the plaintiff intentionally lied
about being unable to pay court fees and made false allegations of family violence to gain an advantage
in the divorce proceedings suggests that a single judge should hear both matters for a clear
understanding of the facts.

--- OCR TEXT ---
Evidence of Misrepresentation and False Statements:

Evidence provided suggests that there have been misrepresentations to the court, including the transfer
of funds from the joint account and the plaintiff's interaction with third parties, which could affect both
the protective order and the divorce outcome. The protective order — which was based on claims of
family violence — are entirely baseless as | have no record of family violence, and no evidence from the
Plaintiff has been provided to substantiate these claims.

Landlord-Tenant Relationship:

The eviction case, although not directly related to family law matters, stems from claims and actions that
are deeply intertwined with the divorce and protective order cases, suggesting that the alleged family
violence and the actions of the plaintiff have been used to justify an eviction that coincides with the
timing of the divorce and protective order filings.

Conclusion:

Given the overlapping factual and legal issues in the divorce and protective order cases, consolidation
would serve the interests of justice and efficiency. It would ensure that the court has a comprehensive
understanding of the intertwined nature of the family's circumstances, which is vital for fair and
equitable resolution of these matters. While the eviction case may not be directly consolidated due to
jurisdictional differences, it should be considered in context with the other cases to provide a complete
picture of the ongoing disputes and to keep the best interests of our children intact.

EXHIBIT A: TEMPORARY VISITATION ADJUSTMENT PROPOSAL

Respondent: Charles Dustin Myers

Understanding the intricate nature of our family's current situation and the legal complexities involved, |,
Charles Dustin Myers, propose a thoughtful adjustment to the visitation schedule that aligns with our
cohabiting status and the abrupt changes brought about by the divorce announcement.

1. Co-habitation Acknowledgement:

It is acknowledged that both parents currently cohabit, which com plicates traditional custody
arrangements. Therefore, the immediate priority is to facilitate a transition where both parties can
establish their respective independent living and working arrangements without disrupting the children's
lives.

2. Transition Period:

Morgan's Employment: Provide Morgan with the necessary support and time to secure stable
employment, which is vital for her to contribute to the children's needs and establish her own residence.

Stable Housing for Charles: As | seek stable housing to maintain my significant role in our daughters'
lives, flexibility in visitation is essential to ensure | continue to fulfill my parental duties.

3. Work and Research Commitments:

The concurrent legal proceedings, particularly those based on unverified claims, demand a substantial

amount of my time for research and preparation to protect the children's wel I-being.

My ability to work has been affected by the proceedings, necessitating an adjustment in my day-to-day

routine to accommodate these new responsibilities.

4. Interim Custody Logic:

Continuity for Children: While we navigate these proceedings, it is critical to maintain stability and
continuity for our children. Any temporary custody arrangements should reflect the least disruptive path

for them.

Counseling and Mediation: | strongly advocate for counseling or mediation to reconcile and navigate the
divorce process, emphasizing the children's best interests rather than abrupt and contentious changes.

5. Court's Facilitation:

The court's facilitation in endorsing a temporary and flexible visitation framework is crucial. This
framework must account for the current living situation and the significant emotional and logistical

upheaval that the divorce proceedings have caused.

This proposal is made in the spirit of cooperation, with a focus on minimizing the impact of our marital
dissolution on our children. It is with a sincere hope that we can transition into a stable co-parenting

arrangement that keeps our children's welfare as the priority.

Respectfully submitted,

Charles Dustin Myers

CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE 
 
Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS hereby certify that I did not serve a 
copy of the Motion for Temporary Orders on the opposing party or counsel prior 
to the hearing because I am invoking Texas Family Code § 105.001(b), which 
allows for the issuance of temporary restraining orders and injunctions without 
the necessity of notice or hearing for the following relief: 
1. Temporary support of the child under Subsection (2); 
2. Restraining a party from disturbing the peace of the child or another party 
under Subsection (3). 
Pursuant to Texas Family Code § 105.001(b), the motion did not require 
prior notice, nor did it require a verified pleading or affidavit showing immediate 
or irreparable harm before notice could be served and a hearing held. 
Accordingly, no service was made prior to the issuance of the order but will be 
served in accordance with the Tex. R. Civ. P. § 21(b) prior to the scheduled 
hearing.
