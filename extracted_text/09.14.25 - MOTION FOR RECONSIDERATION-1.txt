MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION 
The Court’s order granting dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) rested on the conclusion 
that the alleged RICO enterprise ceased to function once Plaintiff was ordered to vacate 
the home, treating the scheme as a single, narrow effort with a discrete goal and no 
ongoing threat. However, the First Amended Complaint specifically alleges that the 
divorce litigation is ongoing, the enterprise’s broader objective—fraudulent disposition of 
property and rights—remains unfulfilled, and there is a real risk of further predicate acts 
as the case proceeds to final trial. Under binding Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit 
authority, these facts plausibly support a claim of open-ended continuity and a pattern of 
racketeering activity, which the Court did not address. 
A motion for reconsideration is appropriate where the Court has overlooked 
material facts or controlling law, or where necessary to prevent manifest injustice. Here,

MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION

The Court’s order granting dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) rested on the conclusion
that the alleged RICO enterprise ceased to function once Plaintiff was ordered to vacate
the home, treating the scheme as a single, narrow effort with a discrete goal and no
ongoing threat. However, the First Amended Complaint specifically alleges that the
divorce litigation is ongoing, the enterprise’s broader objective—fraudulent disposition of
property and rights—remains unfulfilled, and there is a real risk of further predicate acts
as the case proceeds to final trial. Under binding Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit
authority, these facts plausibly support a claim of open-ended continuity and a pattern of
racketeering activity, which the Court did not address.

A motion for reconsideration is appropriate where the Court has overlooked
material facts or controlling law, or where necessary to prevent manifest injustice. Here,
the Court’s order did not fully address the ongoing nature of the enterprise, the risk of

further predicate acts, or the open-ended continuity required under RICO.

Reconsideration should be GRANTED to allow the case to proceed on the merits, 
as the well-pleaded allegations in the First Amended Complaint are sufficient to survive a 
motion to dismiss under the applicable legal standards. 
I. Background and Relevant Law 
A. RICO Pattern Requirement: Relationship and Continuity 
 
1. To state a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege that the defendant conducted 
the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, which requires at 
least two predicate acts that are both related and continuous (George v. Urban Settlement 
Servs., 833 F.3d 1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016); Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851, 858 (10th 
Cir. 2022)). The Supreme Court in H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229 
(1989) clarified that “continuity” can be either closed-ended (a series of related acts over 
a substantial period) or open-ended (a threat of continuing criminal activity into the 
future). The Tenth Circuit has consistently applied this “continuity plus relationship” test 
(Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993); Tal v. Hogan, 453 
F.3d 1244, 1267–68 (10th Cir. 2006)). 
 
2. The “relationship” prong is satisfied when the predicate acts have similar 
purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods, or are otherwise interrelated and not 
isolated events (Schrag v. Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543, 1556 (D. Kan. 1992)). The 
“continuity” prong is more stringent and can be established in two ways: (1) closed-
ended continuity, which requires a series of related predicate acts over a substantial 
period, or (2) open-ended continuity, which requires a threat of continued racketeering 
activity into the future (Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir.

I. Background and Relevant Law
A. RICO Pattern Requirement: Relationship and Continuity

1. To state a civil RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege that the defendant conducted
the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, which requires at
least two predicate acts that are both related and continuous (George v. Urban Settlement
Servs., 833 F.3d 1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016); Johnson v. Heath, 56 F.4th 851, 858 (10th
Cir. 2022)). The Supreme Court in HJ. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229
(1989) clarified that “continuity” can be either closed-ended (a series of related acts over
a substantial period) or open-ended (a threat of continuing criminal activity into the
future). The Tenth Circuit has consistently applied this “continuity plus relationship” test
(Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993); Tal v. Hogan, 453
F.3d 1244, 1267-68 (10th Cir. 2006)).

2. The “relationship” prong is satisfied when the predicate acts have similar
purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods, or are otherwise interrelated and not
isolated events (Schrag v. Dinges, 788 F.Supp. 1543, 1556 (D. Kan. 1992)). The
“continuity” prong is more stringent and can be established in two ways: (1) closed-
ended continuity, which requires a series of related predicate acts over a substantial
period, or (2) open-ended continuity, which requires a threat of continued racketeering

activity into the future (Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir.

1993); H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 241–42; Independent Drug Wholesalers Group, Inc. v. 
Denton, 833 F.Supp. 1507, 1512 (D. Kan. 1993)). 
 
3. Open-ended continuity may be shown by facts indicating that the predicate acts 
are part of an ongoing entity’s regular way of doing business or that there is a threat of 
repetition because the enterprise’s objective is unfulfilled (Watchous Enterprrises, LLC v. 
Pac. Nat'l Capital, LLC, Case No. 16-1432-JTM (D. Kan. Jul 25, 2018). The threat of 
continued criminal activity need not be speculative; it may be grounded in ongoing 
litigation or circumstances that make further predicate acts likely (Fisher Sand & Gravel 
Co. v. FNF Constr., Inc., No. 10-cv-0635 RB/SMV (D. N.M. Mar 27, 2013); Suddath v. 
Oklahoma Homebuilders, LLC, CIV-24-745-SLP (W.D. Okla. Nov 08, 2024)). 
 
4. The Tenth Circuit has repeatedly held that even where a scheme targets a single 
victim, if the plan contemplates open-ended fraudulent activity and does not have a single 
goal that, when achieved, will bring the activity to an end, continuity may be satisfied 
(Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925, 928 (10th Cir. 1987); Edwards v. First Nat. 
Bank, Bartlesville, Oklahoma, 872 F.2d 347, 351 (10th Cir. 1989); Condict v. Condict, 
826 F.2d 923, 927 (10th Cir. 1987)). Conversely, if the scheme is truly isolated and its 
objective is fully achieved, continuity is lacking. Id., 815 F.2d 579, 581 (10th Cir. 1987). 
 
5. At the motion to dismiss stage, the Court must accept all well-pleaded factual 
allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor (George v. 
Urban Settlement Servs., 833 F.3d 1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016)). The question is not 
whether the plaintiff will ultimately prevail, but whether the complaint states a plausible 
claim for relief.

II. Analysis 
B. The Court’s Order and Its Reasoning 
 
6. The Court’s order (Order at 5–7) concluded that Plaintiff failed to allege a 
pattern of racketeering activity because the “primary criminal objective” (removal from 
the home) was achieved within a month, and subsequent communications were not 
sufficiently related to the initial scheme or did not evidence criminal conduct. The Court 
found no open-ended continuity, reasoning that the scheme was complete and that later 
conduct was merely taunting or retaliatory, not a threat of continued racketeering. 
C. Ongoing Nature of the Enterprise and Unfulfilled Objective 
 
7. The First Amended Complaint (referred to herein as “FAC”) alleges that the 
enterprise’s broader objective—fraudulent disposition of property and rights through the 
divorce—remains unfulfilled, and that the divorce litigation is ongoing, with the final 
trial still pending (FAC ¶¶ 49–52, 86(ii)). The complaint details how the Defendants’ 
enterprise continues to operate, with the risk of further predicate acts (such as perjury, 
wire fraud, and manipulation of judicial proceedings) as the case proceeds toward final 
disposition (FAC ¶¶ 49–54, 86(ii), 101–102). The Court’s order did not address these 
allegations, instead treating the “primary objective” as complete upon Plaintiff’s removal 
from the home. However, under RICO, continuity is measured as of the time the suit is 
filed, and the risk of further predicate acts in ongoing litigation is highly relevant 
(Resolution Trust Corp. v. Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993); Fisher Sand & 
Gravel Co. v. FNF Constr., Inc., No. 10-cv-0635 RB/SMV (D. N.M. Mar 27, 2013)).

the home) was achieved within a month, and subsequent communications were not
sufficiently related to the initial scheme or did not evidence criminal conduct. The Court

C. Ongoing Nature of the Enterprise and Unfulfilled Objective

7. The First Amended Complaint (referred to herein as “FAC’’) alleges that the
enterprise’s broader objective—fraudulent disposition of property and rights through the
divorce—remains unfulfilled, and that the divorce litigation is ongoing, with the final
trial still pending (FAC 4 49-52, 86(ii)). The complaint details how the Defendants’
enterprise continues to operate, with the risk of further predicate acts (such as perjury,
wire fraud, and manipulation of judicial proceedings) as the case proceeds toward final
disposition (FAC ¥ 49-54, 86(ii), 101-102). The Court’s order did not address these
allegations, instead treating the “primary objective” as complete upon Plaintiff’s removal
from the home. However, under RICO, continuity is measured as of the time the suit is

D. What the Court Overlooked - Open-Ended Continuity: Threat of Continued 
Criminal Activity 
 
8. The Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit have made clear that open-ended 
continuity exists where the predicate acts pose a threat of continued criminal activity, 
especially where the enterprise’s business is not complete and further acts are likely (H.J. 
Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 241–42 (1989); Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 
1244, 1267 (10th Cir. 2006); Suddath v. Oklahoma Homebuilders, LLC, CIV-24-745-SLP 
(W.D. Okla. Nov 08, 2024)). The FAC alleges that the risk of further predicate acts is not 
speculative but grounded in the ongoing litigation, where Defendants have a continuing 
incentive and opportunity to commit further acts of perjury, wire fraud, or other 
racketeering activity to achieve their ultimate goal (FAC ¶¶ 49–54, 86(ii), 101–102). The 
order’s focus on the completion of the “primary objective” ignores the reality that the 
enterprise’s broader goal—fraudulent disposition of property through the divorce—
remains unachieved, and the litigation is still pending. The risk of further predicate acts is 
thus real and ongoing, supporting open-ended continuity (Resolution Trust Corp. v. 
Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993); Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF Constr., 
Inc., No. 10-cv-0635 RB/SMV (D. N.M. Mar 27, 2013). 
E. Relationship and Pattern 
 
9. The FAC also pleads that the predicate acts are related: they share the same 
purpose (fraudulent deprivation of Plaintiff’s property rights), involve the same 
participants (Myers and Branthoover), target the same victim, and employ similar 
methods (deception, misrepresentation, manipulation of legal processes) (FAC ¶¶ 49–54, 
--- OCR TEXT ---
D. What the Court Overlooked - Open-Ended Continuity: Threat of Continued
Criminal Activity

8. The Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit have made clear that open-ended
continuity exists where the predicate acts pose a threat of continued criminal activity,
especially where the enterprise’s business is not complete and further acts are likely (4.J/.
Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 241-42 (1989); Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d
1244, 1267 (10th Cir. 2006); Suddath v. Oklahoma Homebuilders, LLC, C1V-24-745-SLP
(W.D. Okla. Nov 08, 2024)). The FAC alleges that the risk of further predicate acts is not
speculative but grounded in the ongoing litigation, where Defendants have a continuing
incentive and opportunity to commit further acts of perjury, wire fraud, or other
racketeering activity to achieve their ultimate goal (FAC § 49-54, 86(11), 101-102). The
order’s focus on the completion of the “primary objective” ignores the reality that the
enterprise’s broader goal—fraudulent disposition of property through the divorce—
remains unachieved, and the litigation is still pending. The risk of further predicate acts is
thus real and ongoing, supporting open-ended continuity (Resolution Trust Corp. v.
Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993); Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF Constr.
Inc., No. 10-cv-0635 RB/SMV (D. N.M. Mar 27, 2013).
E. Relationship and Pattern

9. The FAC also pleads that the predicate acts are related: they share the same
purpose (fraudulent deprivation of Plaintiffs property rights), involve the same
participants (Myers and Branthoover), target the same victim, and employ similar

methods (deception, misrepresentation, manipulation of legal processes) (FAC ¥ 49-54,

85, 101). This satisfies the “relationship” prong of the RICO pattern requirement (George 
v. Urban Settlement Servs., 833 F.3d 1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016)). 
F.  The Law Does Not Require Multiple Victims or Schemes 
 
10. The Court’s order relied on the fact that the scheme was directed at a single 
victim and had a “single, narrow purpose.” However, the Tenth Circuit has recognized 
that even a scheme targeting one victim can satisfy the continuity requirement if it 
contemplates open-ended fraudulent activity and does not have a single goal that, when 
achieved, will bring the activity to an end. (Torwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925, 928 
(10th Cir. 1987); Edwards v. First Nat. Bank, Bartlesville, Oklahoma, 872 F.2d 347, 351 
(10th Cir. 1989); Condict v. Condict, 826 F.2d 923, 927 (10th Cir. 1987)). The ongoing 
divorce litigation and the risk of further predicate acts distinguish this case from those 
where the scheme is truly isolated and complete. 
G. The Totality of Circumstances 
 
11. Courts are to consider the totality of the circumstances, not just the timing of 
the initial predicate acts, in assessing continuity (Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF 
Constr., Inc., No. 10-cv-0635 RB/SMV (D. N.M. Mar 27, 2013)). Here, the FAC alleges a 
continuing enterprise, ongoing litigation, and a real risk of further racketeering acts, all of 
which support a finding of open-ended continuity.

85, 101). This satisfies the “relationship” prong of the RICO pattern requirement (George
v. Urban Settlement Servs., 833 F.3d 1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016)).
F. The Law Does Not Require Multiple Victims or Schemes

10. The Court’s order relied on the fact that the scheme was directed at a single
victim and had a “single, narrow purpose.” However, the Tenth Circuit has recognized
that even a scheme targeting one victim can satisfy the continuity requirement if it
contemplates open-ended fraudulent activity and does not have a single goal that, when
achieved, will bring the activity to an end. (Jorwest DBC, Inc. v. Dick, 810 F.2d 925, 928
(10th Cir. 1987); Edwards v. First Nat. Bank, Bartlesville, Oklahoma, 872 F.2d 347, 351
(10th Cir. 1989); Condict v. Condict, 826 F.2d 923, 927 (10th Cir. 1987)). The ongoing
divorce litigation and the risk of further predicate acts distinguish this case from those
where the scheme is truly isolated and complete.
G. The Totality of Circumstances

11. Courts are to consider the totality of the circumstances, not just the timing of
the initial predicate acts, in assessing continuity (Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. FNF
Constr., Inc., No. 10-cv-0635 RB/SMV (D. N.M. Mar 27, 2013)). Here, the FAC alleges a
continuing enterprise, ongoing litigation, and a real risk of further racketeering acts, all of

which support a finding of open-ended continuity.

H. Application to the Complaint and Order

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
 
12. The FAC alleges that the enterprise’s objective—fraudulent disposition of 
property through the divorce—remains unfulfilled, and the risk of further predicate acts is 
ongoing (FAC ¶¶ 49–54, 86(ii), 101–102). The order did not address these ongoing risks, 
instead treating the “primary objective” as complete and the scheme as isolated (Order at 
6–7). Under controlling law, the ongoing litigation and risk of further predicate acts 
support open-ended continuity and a pattern of racketeering activity (H.J. Inc. v. 
Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 241–42 (1989); Resolution Trust Corp. v. 
Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993); Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1267 (10th 
Cir. 2006)). 
IV. Standard for Reconsideration 
 
13. A motion for reconsideration under Rule 59(e) is appropriate where the court 
has overlooked material facts or controlling law, or where necessary to prevent manifest 
injustice (Servants of Paraclete v. Does, 204 F.3d 1005, 1012 (10th Cir. 2000), not in 
table but widely cited in Tenth Circuit). Here, the Court’s order did not fully address the 
ongoing nature of the enterprise, the risk of further predicate acts, or the open-ended 
continuity required under RICO. Reconsideration should be sought to allow the case to 
proceed on the merits, as the well-pleaded allegations in the First Amended Complaint 
are sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss under the applicable legal standards. 
I. Pleading Standard 
 
14. At the motion to dismiss stage, the Court must accept as true all well-pleaded 
allegations and draw all reasonable inferences in Plaintiff’s favor (George v. Urban 
Settlement Servs., 833 F.3d 1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016)). The Court’s order (Order at 5–

12. The FAC alleges that the enterprise’s objective—fraudulent disposition of
property through the divorce—remains unfulfilled, and the risk of further predicate acts is
ongoing (FAC {ff 49-54, 86(ii), 101-102). The order did not address these ongoing risks,
instead treating the “primary objective” as complete and the scheme as isolated (Order at
6-7). Under controlling law, the ongoing litigation and risk of further predicate acts
support open-ended continuity and a pattern of racketeering activity (HJ. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 241-42 (1989); Resolution Trust Corp. v.
Stone, 998 F.2d 1534, 1543 (10th Cir. 1993); Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1267 (10th
Cir. 2006)).

IV. Standard for Reconsideration

13. A motion for reconsideration under Rule 59(e) is appropriate where the court
has overlooked material facts or controlling law, or where necessary to prevent manifest
injustice (Servants of Paraclete v. Does, 204 F.3d 1005, 1012 (10th Cir. 2000), not in
table but widely cited in Tenth Circuit). Here, the Court’s order did not fully address the
ongoing nature of the enterprise, the risk of further predicate acts, or the open-ended
continuity required under RICO. Reconsideration should be sought to allow the case to
proceed on the merits, as the well-pleaded allegations in the First Amended Complaint
are sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss under the applicable legal standards.

I. Pleading Standard

14. At the motion to dismiss stage, the Court must accept as true all well-pleaded

allegations and draw all reasonable inferences in Plaintiff’s favor (George v. Urban

Settlement Servs., 833 F.3d 1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2016)). The Court’s order (Order at 5—

6) failed to do so, instead characterizing the ongoing conduct as unrelated or merely 
retaliatory, without crediting the FAC’s specific allegations that these acts are part of the 
same enterprise and serve the same fraudulent purpose. The Court also failed to recognize 
that the pattern requirement is not defeated simply because the initial dispossession 
occurred; the ongoing risk of further racketeering, as pleaded, is sufficient to establish 
open-ended continuity (Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d at 1267–68; RICO. 
V. Exceptions 
 
15. It is true that courts are cautious about finding RICO continuity in cases 
involving a single scheme and a single victim, especially where the scheme is short-lived 
and its objective is fully achieved (Skurkey v. Daniel, No. CIV-22-496-R, 2023 WL 
101946, at *6 (W.D. Okla. Jan. 4, 2023)). However, the key distinction here is that the 
FAC alleges the scheme is ongoing, the objective is unfulfilled, and the risk of further 
predicate acts is real due to the pending litigation. The facts alleged go beyond mere 
retaliation or taunting and plausibly support a threat of continued racketeering activity. 
 
16. It is noteworthy to mention the negative treatment of Condict v. Condict, 815 
F.2d 579 (10th Cir. 1987) in Maxwell v. Wilson, 766 P.2d 909 (N.M. 1988) does not affect 
the federal RICO analysis, as the Tenth Circuit’s approach to open-ended continuity 
remains consistent with Supreme Court precedent and has not been overruled. 
VI. Conclusion 
 
17. With the utmost respect, Plaintiff has shown that the Court’s order overlooked 
material allegations and controlling law regarding the ongoing nature of the enterprise 
and the real threat of continued racketeering activity. The FAC alleges that the

that the pattern requirement is not defeated simply because the initial dispossession

V. Exceptions

15. It is true that courts are cautious about finding RICO continuity in cases
involving a single scheme and a single victim, especially where the scheme is short-lived
and its objective is fully achieved (Skurkey v. Daniel, No. CIV-22-496-R, 2023 WL
101946, at *6 (W.D. Okla. Jan. 4, 2023)). However, the key distinction here is that the
FAC alleges the scheme is ongoing, the objective is unfulfilled, and the risk of further
predicate acts is real due to the pending litigation. The facts alleged go beyond mere
retaliation or taunting and plausibly support a threat of continued racketeering activity.

16. It is noteworthy to mention the negative treatment of Condict v. Condict, 815
F.2d 579 (10th Cir. 1987) in Maxwell v. Wilson, 766 P.2d 909 (N.M. 1988) does not affect
the federal RICO analysis, as the Tenth Circuit’s approach to open-ended continuity
remains consistent with Supreme Court precedent and has not been overruled.

VI. Conclusion

17. With the utmost respect, Plaintiff has shown that the Court’s order overlooked

material allegations and controlling law regarding the ongoing nature of the enterprise

and the real threat of continued racketeering activity. The FAC alleges that the

enterprise’s objective is unfulfilled, the divorce litigation is ongoing, and the risk of 
further predicate acts remains as the final trial approaches. Under Supreme Court and 
Tenth Circuit precedent, these facts plausibly support a claim of open-ended continuity 
and a pattern of racketeering activity. Reconsideration is warranted to address these 
material allegations and to prevent manifest injustice. Only if reconsideration is denied 
should the Plaintiff proceed to appeal, as the record will then clearly reflect that the 
district court was given the opportunity to address these controlling legal standards and 
material facts. 
VII. Prayer 
 
WHEREFORE, all promises considered, Plaintiff CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS 
respectfully asks this court to provide the following relief: 
1. Grant the motion for reconsideration; 
2. Vacate or set aside the order of dismissal signed on August 28, 2025; 
3. Require the defendants to file a response to the complaint; 
4. Allow the matter to proceed to discovery; 
5. Grant any further relief that the court deems necessary given the 
circumstances. 
 
Respectfully submitted,
