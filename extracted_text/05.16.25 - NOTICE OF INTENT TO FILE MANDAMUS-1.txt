CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, Notice of Intent to File Mandamus

Respondent.

2025-05-16

To the Honorable David L. Evans:
Respondent in the above styled cause, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS,

respectfully submits this notice of intent to file mandamus regarding the Order
Overruling Respondent’s Objection signed May 15, 2025, and in support thereof,

shows the following:

I. APPLICABLE LAW

1. Court Coordinators and Recusal

Pursuant to Texas Government Code Sec. 74.101, the provision that a court
coordinator serves at the pleasure of the appointing judge implies that a

coordinator assigned by a district judge is distinct from the administrative

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
judge. The statute clearly differentiates between the local administrative judge 
and each district or statutory county court judge, granting them separate 
authority to establish court coordinator systems and appoint court coordinators 
who serve at the pleasure of their respective appointing judges. 
      The statute specifically states that "the local administrative judge and each 
district or statutory county court judge" may establish a court coordinator 
system and appoint a court coordinator for their court. This language places the 
local administrative judge and other judges on equal footing with respect to 
coordinator appointments, with each having independent authority to appoint 
coordinators for their own courts. Furthermore, subsection (b) establishes that 
"each court coordinator serves at the pleasure of the judge who appointed him," 
creating a direct reporting relationship between the coordinator and their 
specific appointing judge. 
      The distinction between a court coordinator assigned by a district judge and 
the administrative judge is further supported by the broader statutory context. 
Texas Government Code Sec. 75.401, while addressing court administrator 
systems rather than court coordinators specifically, reinforces the concept of 
separate judicial roles in court administration. This complementary provision 
shows that Texas law establishes different administrative functions within the 
court system, with court administrators cooperating with various judges,

judge. The statute clearly differentiates between the local administrative judge
and each district or statutory county court judge, granting them separate
authority to establish court coordinator systems and appoint court coordinators

who serve at the pleasure of their respective appointing judges.

The statute specifically states that "the local administrative judge and each
district or statutory county court judge" may establish a court coordinator
system and appoint a court coordinator for their court. This language places the
local administrative judge and other judges on equal footing with respect to
coordinator appointments, with each having independent authority to appoint
coordinators for their own courts. Furthermore, subsection (b) establishes that
"each court coordinator serves at the pleasure of the judge who appointed him,"
creating a direct reporting relationship between the coordinator and their

specific appointing judge.

The distinction between a court coordinator assigned by a district judge and
the administrative judge is further supported by the broader statutory context.
Texas Government Code Sec. 75.401, while addressing court administrator
systems rather than court coordinators specifically, reinforces the concept of
separate judicial roles in court administration. This complementary provision
shows that Texas law establishes different administrative functions within the

court system, with court administrators cooperating with various judges,

including "regional, presiding, and local administrative judges." This 
cooperative relationship would be unnecessary if the court coordinator positions 
were not distinct from administrative judges. While Section 75.401 addresses 
court administrators rather than court coordinators directly, it provides valuable 
context for understanding the relationships between different judicial roles and 
court administrative staff in the Texas court system. 
        In this instance, the Respondent objected to the court coordinator handling 
the recusal proceedings who was appointed by the same District Judge subject 
to the recusal when the statute set forth in the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 
specifically designates duties to the clerk of the court, not the coordinator. 
II. 
ANALYSIS 
      In the order overruling the objection, it was stated that “[t]he court 
coordinators and clerks work together to assist the trial court judges and the 
administrative judges. Only the judges, not the litigants, have the authority to 
direct the activities of the court coordinators and clerks.” Here, the court 
misapplied the rule. As stated above, 75.401(b) of the code expressly states that 
“[e]ach court coordinator serves at the pleasure of the judge who appointed 
him.” Because the court coordinator in question was appointed by the 
Honorable Judge subject to recusal and based on the analysis of Texas

Government Code Sec. 74.101 and the supplementary context provided by 
Section 75.401, the provision that a court coordinator serves at the pleasure of 
the appointing judge strongly implies that a coordinator assigned by a district 
judge is distinct from the administrative judge. This conclusion is supported by 
multiple aspects of the statutory language: 
1. The statute separately identifies "the local administrative judge and each 
district or statutory county court judge" as authorities who may establish 
court coordinator systems and appoint court coordinators. 
2. Each judge may appoint a coordinator specifically "for his court," suggesting 
a one-to-one relationship between judges and the coordinators for their 
courts. 
3. Each court coordinator "serves at the pleasure of the judge who appointed 
him," creating a direct accountability relationship between the coordinator 
and the specific appointing judge. 
4. The complementary provisions regarding court administrators explicitly 
distinguish between administrative judges and the courts served by 
administrators, requiring cooperation between them.

might face competing demands, undermining the efficiency the system is designed 
to promote. 
    Furthermore, the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure governing recusal are 
unambiguous, and designate no responsibilities regarding recusal proceedings to be 
handled by the coordinator. See Id. 18a(e) (specifically designating duties to the 
clerk of the court) By permitting the involvement of the coordinator in the recusal 
proceedings when that coordinator was appointed by the district judge subject to 
recusal would be prejudicial. 
     Finally, regarding the reference to Judge Kaitcer in these proceedings, the order 
is also prejudicial – because no such motion was ever filed implicating Honorable 
Jeff Kaitcer in the current proceedings. To overrule this objection but permit the 
assigned judge to consider that issue on a motion not before the court would cause 
further delay, waste judicial resources, and effectuate the exact opposite purpose of 
the statute invoked and used to overrule the objection. (74.102(b)) By permitting 
the coordinator to ‘work together’ with the clerks would exceed the statutory 
authority set forth in the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.

III. 
CONCLUSION 
      In conclusion, the legal framework governing recusal motions in Texas courts 
requires the use of clerks, not coordinators, for handling these matters. 
Administrative judges must comply with these requirements and cannot substitute 
coordinators for clerks in the recusal process.  To obtain relief through a writ of 
mandamus, the relator must establish that (1) the act he seeks to compel is 
ministerial, rather than discretionary, in nature and (2) no other adequate remedy at 
law is available. Engle v. Coker, 820 S.W.2d 247 (Tex. App.—Beaumont 1991, no 
pet.). An act is ministerial if it constitutes a duty clearly fixed and required by law, 
without the exercise of discretion or judgment. Here, the act of following the Texas 
Rules of Civil Procedure regarding the recusal process is ministerial, and 
mandamus is the appropriate remedy to challenge the May 15, 2025, order 
overruling the Respondent’s objection for the reasons stated. The use of a 
coordinator instead of the statutory required clerk is a failure to perform a 
ministerial duty. As explained in In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006), 
mandamus relief may be available when a judge fails to follow mandatory 
procedural requirements related to recusal motions.

the Objection dated April 29, 2025 that were filed Charles Dustin Myers in the above-entitled
cause.

Mr. Myers complains of the court coordinator’s involvement in the recusal process. A
Court Coordinator’s duties include assisting the administrative judges. See Tex. Gov't Code Ann.
§ 74.102(b) which provides as follows:

To promote uniform and efficient administration of justice in this state, the court

The court coordinators and clerks work together to assist the trial judges and the
administrative judges. Only the judges, not the litigants, have the authority to direct the activities
of the court coordinators and clerks. Mr. Myers’ objections regarding the involvement are
overruled.

Mr. Myers also objects to the referral by Judge Kaitcer of a motion to recuse (Kaitcer

recusal motion) to the undersigned. This objection is overruled. However, the judge who hears

the Kaitcer recusal motion may take into consideration Mr. Myers’ claim that he did not file a

motion to recuse Judge Kaitcer.

The Court, having considered the objections is of the opinion that the objections should
be DENIED.
IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Objection to Order of Assignment Dated May

6, 2025 and the Objection filed on April 29, 2025 are DENIED.
