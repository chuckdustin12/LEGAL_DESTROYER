TO THE HONORABLE JAMES MUNFORD:

On January 16, 2024, we first met under notably peculiar circumstances.
Initially, the court had publicly announced its closure via Facebook. Exhibit 1. I'm
certain you were just as astonished to learn there were parties waiting outside
expecting a hearing, as we were to find ourselves standing in a courthouse with the
lights turned off.

I had been compelled to appear to show the court why a protective order
should not be ordered against me. I appeared with a white binder ready to do just
that — my daughter’s faces on the front cover to remind myself of what I was

fighting for.

Back then, this was all foreign to me. That had been my first time in a 
courtroom since I was a child going through the divorce process as an adolescent. 
Nonetheless, I did not come unprepared. I came ready to defend myself against the 
claims made against me. I came ready to defend the family that I had worked so 
hard to protect. 
If you recall, on that day my wife arrived accompanied by Debbie Price and 
Damen Kazlauskas, names familiar to this record. Although you undoubtedly 
witness countless individuals and cases, I am certain this one stands out vividly—
as it was perhaps the only time in your judicial career you sat as a District Judge 
presiding in the Associate Judge’s court, alone in an otherwise vacant courthouse. 
Since that moment, my life and my children’s lives have been completely upended, 
forcing me into an endless cycle of litigation and desperate attempts to uncover any 
justification for these events. For the past 13 months, I have diligently studied and 
sought answers, driven solely by necessity. However, upon reviewing the 
Petitioner's original pleadings, I realized you acted out of caution—and now I can 
clearly demonstrate why that caution was misplaced. The allegations made were 
not only exaggerated but entirely false, and the evidence I now present will 
decisively confirm this. With this clarity, I respectfully request that you reconsider 
the events of that day and rectify the resulting injustice, and the last fourteen 
months will become as clear to you as they now are to me due to the foregoing:

I. 
INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 
I have had one goal since January 16, 2024: get home so that I can plan for 
my children’s future, and my own future. While it’s true that my wife’s 
grandparents own the house at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148, the need 
for the residency is essential to ﬁnd a replacement. I agree with you: in a normal 
situation, who would want to live next door to their ex-wife’s grandparents? In my 
case, it’s not that I want to, I have to temporarily.  
A unique situation 
As stated throughout this litigation, I worked from inside the home. My line 
of work involves data analysis, web development, and working with financial 
market data. This requires a very high level of bandwidth that cannot be 
accommodated without specific internet connection with fiber connectivity. This 
means providers like charter spectrum are a no-go. To satisfy my client’s needs, I 
must have latency-free internet, or the services I provide (real-time market data, 
including stock options and database operations) are not adequate, and the clients I 
serve will seek alternate services. 
As my client-base grew in 2022, I took some time off work to be with the 
family and developed a plan to scale my operations effectively. This operation took 
roughly one year to complete and was finalized when switching over to AT&T 
fiber internet in September 2023, as shown in FIGURE 1.

I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND

I have had one goal since January 16, 2024: get home so that I can plan for
my children’s future, and my own future. While it’s true that my wife’s
grandparents own the house at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148, the need
for the residency is essential to find areplacement. I agree with you: in a normal
situation, who would want to live next door to their ex-wife’s grandparents? In my
case, it’s not that I want to, I have to temporarily.

A unique situation

As stated throughout this litigation, I worked from inside the home. My line
of work involves data analysis, web development, and working with financial
market data. This requires a very high level of bandwidth that cannot be
accommodated without specific internet connection with fiber connectivity. This
means providers like charter spectrum are a no-go. To satisfy my client’s needs, I
must have latency-free internet, or the services I provide (real-time market data,
including stock options and database operations) are not adequate, and the clients I
serve will seek alternate services.

As my client-base grew in 2022, I took some time off work to be with the
family and developed a plan to scale my operations effectively. This operation took
roughly one year to complete and was finalized when switching over to AT&T

fiber internet in September 2023, as shown in FIGURE 1.

Figure 1 reflects the growth arc and operational turbulence of my business. 
The peak in paid members occurred in July 2022, which corresponds directly to the 
point where I initiated a strategic scale-up of my infrastructure to accommodate 
rising demand. However, during this transition, the existing internet setup proved 
inadequate for the demands of live financial data services, database operations, and 
client-side analytics. The result was a noticeable drop in paid subscriptions, as the 
quality of service temporarily declined due to latency issues and inconsistent 
bandwidth.

The upgrade 
Determined to retain trust and stabilize operations, I paused active business 
development and invested in the long-term infrastructure needed to support client 
needs at scale. This culminated in the September 2023 installation of AT&T Fiber, 
a critical upgrade that provided the low-latency, high-throughput connectivity 
required for real-time stock and options data processing. The PETITIONER was 
aware of this:

any kind residency change would need to be carefully planned in order to 
accommodate my client base, and time would be needed to ensure a smooth 
transition occurred. Not only for my business, but more importantly, for our 
daughters. 
Family dynamics 
 
Once my home-based work environment was established, the greatest reward 
became clear: being present in my children's lives every single day. I was there for 
every meaningful moment—volunteering on school field trips, bathing them, 
assisting with homework, reading bedtime stories, preparing and sharing meals, 
caring for them when they were sick, walking them to and from school, taking them 
to dance class, playing outdoors, and creating cherished family memories on 
vacations. 
This privilege didn't come easily; it was the direct result of countless hours 
spent building my business from scratch, precisely so I could be an active, hands-on 
parent. To be clear, Petitioner was never an unfit parent; she loved our children 
deeply, actively participated, and shared in many of these same responsibilities and 
moments.  
This dream-like scenario manifested to prevent my children from having to 
live the unstable up-bringing I faced as a child, to give them what I never had, and 
to ensure that they never had to live through what I did as a young child: divorce.

THE DIVORCE AND EVENTS LEADING UP TO REMOVAL 
The divorce announcement 
On December 1st, 2023, Petitioner announced her desire for a divorce. This

Hi. THE DIVORCE AND EVENTS LEADING UP TO REMOVAL

The divorce announcement

On December 1*', 2023, Petitioner announced her desire for a divorce. This
announcement so close to the holidays was not only shocking, but it was also a
complete blindside. Even her grandfather, who I still get along with very well,

agreed with this fact:

oh wow that's really cool

Hey.. we need to talk tomorrow.
All of us

Our kids lives and stability are at risk

Morgan blindsided me with a divorce

be ok for us. Willing to do anything to
help.

The people closest to her had no clue that divorce was even a possibility, and
our biggest concern immediately became the girls. Unsure of what to do, I began to

investigate, and what I discovered unveils the true motive of the Petitioner.

The affair 
 
On December 12, 2023, just before sending the text message above to 
“Papaw”, her grandfather next-door, I discovered a concerning amount of text 
messages on our jointly owned AT&T account. The context of these messages is 
unknown, but sheer volume alone was enough to raise suspicion, which ultimately 
ended up being a valid suspicion indeed.  
 
Attached is EXHIBIT A, which is a CASE MEMORANDUM that I filed with 
the court and served on the opposing party on January 13, 2025. If you click the 
forthcoming exhibit reference, it will take you to the relevant section of the 
memorandum: EX. A, P.8 
 
This level of communication is not only concerning, but it’s the first sign that 
Petitioner’s priorities were shifting away from the children, and onto something else. 
The raw text messages with the timestamps have been served to the opposing 
counsel and can be found as EXHIBIT B attached hereto. 
 
My area of work involves aspects of data visualization, and when you plot the 
data from these messages as shown in EX. A, P.10 the exponential nature of this 
relationship grew substantially. In fact, the chart reveals that this relationship took

I. INTRODUCTION
1. A Year of Unjust Exile
On January 16, 2024, this Court authorized the removal of Respondent from his own 
home—a decision that, to this day (January 13, 2025), remains unexplained. Despite 
Respondent’s diligent pursuit of relief from multiple courts and encountering numerous judicial 
officers (including the Second Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court of Texas, the Honorable 8th 
Administrative Regional Judge, the Honorable Justice Lee Gabriel, the Northern District of 
Texas, and now the Western District of Oklahoma), not one venue has addressed the glaring 
inconsistencies and fraud underpinning the orders that separated a father from his children 
without justification.  
2. Complete Lack of Opposition or Defense
No one—neither the Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, nor her counsel—has bothered 
to dispute Respondent’s sworn allegations or offer any substantive defense. They have failed to 
participate in discovery, neglected to provide legitimate service, and have offered no rebuttal to 
the detailed factual record establishing fraud. This utter silence speaks volumes, particularly 
given the life-altering stakes for Respondent and the children who have lost a parent’s day-to-day 
presence in contrast to this State’s policy. See Tex. Fam. Code sec. 153.001.

I. INTRODUCTION

1. A Year of Unjust Exile

On January 16, 2024, this Court authorized the removal of Respondent from his own
home—a decision that, to this day (January 13, 2025), remains unexplained. Despite
Respondent’s diligent pursuit of relief from multiple courts and encountering numerous judicial
officers (including the Second Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court of Texas, the Honorable 8th
Administrative Regional Judge, the Honorable Justice Lee Gabriel, the Northern District of
Texas, and now the Western District of Oklahoma), not one venue has addressed the glaring
inconsistencies and fraud underpinning the orders that separated a father from his children

without justification.

2. Complete Lack of Opposition or Defense

No one—neither the Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, nor her counsel—has bothered
to dispute Respondent’s sworn allegations or offer any substantive defense. They have failed to
participate in discovery, neglected to provide legitimate service, and have offered no rebuttal to
the detailed factual record establishing fraud. This utter silence speaks volumes, particularly
given the life-altering stakes for Respondent and the children who have lost a parent’s day-to-day

presence in contrast to this State’s policy. See Tex. Fam. Code sec. 153.001.

3. Unprecedented and Ongoing Harm
Respondent has lost his family, his home, and his means of earning a livelihood. He has 
also lost precious, irreplaceable time in his children’s lives. This Court’s removal order 
effectively rewarded Petitioner’s deceptive pleadings—pleadings that all evidence shows were 
purpose-built to conceal her own misconduct and to deny Respondent even a semblance of due 
process or a say in the dissolution of his eight-year marriage. 
4. Urgent Appeal for Corrective Action
Respondent implores this Honorable Court—and any judicial authority reading this 
record—to immediately rectify this travesty. The legal system’s core responsibility is to 
protect children’s best interests and uphold fairness in family disputes. Here, neither principle 
has been honored. This matter demands an urgent remedy. See Tex. Fam. Code sec. 153.002 
II. DECEPTION UPON THE COURT
5. Four Filings in Rapid Succession
The Petitioner, MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS, approached the 322nd District Court of 
Tarrant County a total of three times between December 14th, 2023, and December 22nd, 2023, 
where she requested an ex-parte order of protection, filed an affidavit of inability to pay court 
costs, an original petition for divorce, and an application for a standard protective order. A true 
and accurate copy of these documents has been attached for reference. True and accurate copies 
of these documents have been attached hereto. 
6. Covert Preparations and Assistance
Immediately after the first filing (December 14, 2023), Petitioner opened a new bank 
account. She then traveled to Yukon, Oklahoma, where her relative, Dan Branthoover, admittedly 
assisted her in preparing subsequent filings designed to achieve the very result we see today—

Il. DECEPTION UPON THE COURT

5. Four Filings in Rapid Succession

The Petitioner, MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS, approached the 322™ District Court of
Tarrant County a total of three times between December 14", 2023, and December 224, 2023,
where she requested an ex-parte order of protection, filed an affidavit of inability to pay court
costs, an original petition for divorce, and an application for a standard protective order. A true
and accurate copy of these documents has been attached for reference. True and accurate copies

Respondent’s abrupt removal from his home. Mr. Branthoover is now facing a suit in the Western 
District of Oklahoma for his pivotal role in perpetuating the fraud that has so grievously harmed 
Respondent and the children and with clear malicious intent. 
FALSE REPRESENTATION OF THE CASE BEING UN-CONTESTED 
7. Illusion of Agreement from the Start
The first knowingly false document presented came in the form of a request for an 
attorney to review the Petitioner’s paperwork where she claimed that the case was uncontested. 
This only came after an emergency protective order request, calling into question her credibility 
from the start. 
AFFIDAVIT OF INABILITY TO PAY COURT COSTS 
8. Sworn Misrepresentations
The Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, declared under penalty of perjury that she 
could not afford the $400 filing fee for divorce and that the children “relied solely on her 
income.” Yet the record conclusively shows that Respondent was the primary provider. Further, 
Petitioner’s own texts confirm she had far more than enough funds at the time of filing. 
Specifically:  
1. On December 16, 2023, Petitioner and her relative, Dan Branthoover, both openly
admitted via text message that Petitioner moved marital funds into her personal
account. This is corroborated by statements from both Branthoover and Petitioner
acknowledging the transfer via text message.
2. Petitioner then proceeded to lie on the December 18, 2023, Affidavit of Inability to
Pay, claiming she had “only $20” in her bank account.
9. The Conversion of $1,576.00 and Additional Deceptions

Supported by bank statements and text message evidence, there is no doubt Petitioner had 
more than sufficient resources to cover court costs at the time she claimed indigency. These facts 
have been pleaded numerous times without any rebuttal from Petitioner. As such, the case should 
be dismissed under § 13.001 of the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code, because her affidavit 
was indisputably falsified. 
10. Fictitious Expenses
In her affidavit, Petitioner also represented to the Court that she personally paid for both 
car payments—a 2023 Mazda CX-5 and a 2020 Mazda3 as well as $800 in monthly rent plus 
utilities. These statements are demonstrably untrue. Bank records prove that Respondent, not 
Petitioner, was the primary financial manager covering these obligations. Moreover, Respondent 
is currently paying for these same vehicles that Petitioner claimed she alone was financing, one 
of which has been damaged by the Petitioner. Not only was Petitioner never solely responsible 
for these payments, but her own text messages show that on December 16, 2023, she withdrew 
or transferred significant funds to herself and then declared under oath—just two days later—that 
she was penniless and could not afford the $400 court costs. 
Taken together, these glaring contradictions demolish the veracity of Petitioner’s 
“indigency” claim and warrant dismissal. 
THE ORIGINAL PETITION FOR DIVORCE 
11. Petitioner’s Contradictory Statements
The divorce petition, filed on December 18, 2023, contained allegations that a protective 
order had been requested on December 14 but remained undecided, while simultaneously 
asserting that an “active” protective order existed finding family violence, thus justifying a 60-
day waiver. These allegations are inconsistent and should have alerted the Court to Petitioner’s

lack of credibility. Moreover, Texas Family Code § 6.405(b) requires attaching any protective 
order referenced in a divorce petition, which Petitioner failed to do. 6.405(b)’s protections were 
overlooked by the court, as no hearing should have ever taken place on January 16th, 2024, given 
this claimed order of protection was never could not ever have been presented to the court 
because it has never existed. 
12. Critical Misstep by the Court
Had the Court recognized these glaring inconsistencies—or merely reviewed the 
supporting documents—it would have avoided its own January 16, 2024, order expelling 
Respondent from the marital residence.  
THE APPLICATION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER 
13. The Second, Frivolous Request
On December 22, 2023, Petitioner pursued yet another protective order, despite having 
just claimed—four days earlier—that she already had one in effect. This confounding behavior 
shows that Petitioner was bent on amassing multiple orders to ensure Respondent’s removal, 
despite no demonstrable threat or legitimate need to do so. 
14. Contradictory Conduct That Undermines Credibility
 Text messages and photographs from December 22, 2023, depict Petitioner laughing and 
playing with the children in the marital home alongside Respondent—the very person she 
allegedly “feared.” No credible evidence has ever been presented to support her allegations of 
family violence. Instead, the protective-order filings clearly appear more like strategic 
maneuvers to lock in “temporary orders,” later, which is exactly what occurred. Perhaps most 
alarming is that the current orders are purported to be agreed, just as the case was first purported 
to be uncontested. The level of injustice here must be addressed.

THE CURRENT TEMPORARY ORDERS 
15. Mischaracterized “Agreed” Orders
These temporary orders cite a motion never served on Respondent and a hearing that 
never occurred. The orders erroneously state Respondent “agreed,” yet only Petitioner’s 
signature appears. This deficiency alone robs the orders of procedural validity. 
16. Lack of Substantive Participation by Petitioner’s Counsel
Petitioner’s counsel filed no substantive pleadings and participated minimally in court—
mainly through baseless objections blocking Respondent’s right to cross-examine Petitioner. 
Unsurprisingly, these “temporary” orders contain multiple factual inaccuracies and remain 
uncontested only because Petitioner and her counsel have refused to litigate the matter on the 
merits.  
17. An Engineered Narrative to Justify Removing Respondent
Respondent’s evidence—bank statements, text logs, phone records—reveals Petitioner’s 
true motive: to conceal her misconduct, secure the marital residence, and isolate Respondent 
from the children during the holidays, all while ignoring basic rules of discovery and honesty to 
live out a fantasy that had been culminating for over a year. 
III. PETITIONER’S MOTIVE
DEBBIE PRICE AND DAMEN KAZLAUSKAS 
18. Why Go to Such Extremes?
Why would a spouse fabricate claims of needing protection, systematically lie under oath 
about her finances, and manipulate the judicial system? The answer emerged on December 12, 
2023, when Respondent discovered over 16,500 text messages between Petitioner and two 
individuals outside the marriage, Debbie Price and Damen Kazlauskas. Faced with the imminent

embarked on a frantic quest to lock Respondent out of the marital home and silence any 
questions about her own wrongdoing. 
19. Sudden Divorce Announcement
On December 1, 2023, Petitioner abruptly told Respondent she intended to divorce him, 
without any prior discussion or warning. Initially, she claimed her dissatisfaction stemmed solely 
from how he “talked” to her, only to expand her grievances to the entire marriage—including 
family vacations once touted as joyful. This immediate about-face suggests Petitioner was 
already laying the groundwork for her broader scheme. 
20. The Phone Records and AT&T Data
By December 12, 2023, Respondent delved into the couple’s joint AT&T account, 
recalling Petitioner’s previous infidelity to seek answers given her unwillingness to 
communicate. The phone and text logs—registered under Petitioner’s grandmother’s name at the 
time—confirmed an enormous volume of messages with Price and Kazlauskas, rendering 
Petitioner’s evolving divorce rationales unconvincing.

The data from the text records are presented from a volume standpoint alone and does not

23. Astonishing Communication Volume
Over 10,000 messages with Debbie and more than 6,000 with Damen spell out a deeply 
involved relationship that overshadows all other contacts. In a typical marriage, one might expect 
the most communication to be with family, but here, it is with two outsiders—raising the strong 
inference of intimacy and influence. 
24. Disregard for Family Obligations
The slope of these lines proves that Petitioner’s daily communications revolved around

Petitioner hastened to block Respondent from accessing more evidence by obtaining a second

reserved for work or private time with one’s spouse. Repeated overnight messaging to the

dwarfs normal daytime communication with the spouse suggests secrecy or intimacy. This is

30. Identifying Key Spikes

In data analysis, an outlier is a data point that significantly differs from the rest of the

dataset. It represents an unusual or extreme event that stands out from typical patterns or trends.

Outliers often indicate anomalies, irregular behavior, or important events that warrant closer

examination.

Here, outliers in the data correspond to events critical to Petitioner’s agenda—such as

December 12 (Respondent’s discovery of these messages) and December 14 (her initial ex parte

request). These spikes illustrate reactionary upticks in communication designed to manage or

conceal her wrongdoing and appear in red and purple.

The evidence is clear and troubling. Data reveals a sustained and excessive pattern of

communication between the Petitioner and Debbie Price and Damen Kazlauskas, far exceeding

casual relationships. These interactions, often late at night and early morning, detracted from her 
family responsibilities and raises serious concerns about her priorities and judgment. 
31. Introducing Strangers to the Children
Adding to the concern, Kazlauskas is now frequently around the children and has taken 
them places alone—behavior that is unprecedented and raises questions about the 
appropriateness of his involvement, and is particularly sickening given he was rarely involved in 
their lives prior to this litigation commencing. 
32. Accountability in Silence
Petitioner’s refusal to address these factual allegations, and the failure of her counsel to 
defend the claims against her combined with her legal maneuvers evidences a strategy of 
obfuscation and evasion. This Court must not allow a litigant to exploit its processes for such 
improper ends. 
IV. RELIEF AS A MATTER OF LAW
Despite Respondent’s diligent, repeated pleas, the Court has yet to intervene. The record 
establishes a prima facie case for relief as a matter of law—no reasonable factfinder could view 
these undisputed facts and deny the injustice at hand. The current situation contradicts these 
mandates, as the children who once had continuous and frequent access to both parents now only 
have access to one.  
Texas law prioritizes frequent, meaningful contact between children and both parents. 
Currently, the children see Petitioner’s new associate (Kazlauskas) more than their own father, 
who has been shut out without any legitimate legal foundation. The Respondent urges the 
reviewing body of this document to swiftly restore justice and peace to the Children’s lives.

V. CONCLUSION
Respondent was the primary caregiver for his children, yet on January 16, 2024, he was 
summarily ousted from their lives—based on Petitioner’s fabricated affidavits and contradictory 
statements. The fiasco has destroyed the family’s financial stability and subjected the children to 
confusion and distress. The Petitioner has lied to the Court, her own family, and, worst of all, her 
children. She has leveraged erroneous judicial rulings to further her clandestine relationships 
with Debbie Price and Damen Kazlauskas, evidencing a profound disregard for her children’s 
needs. Time and again, Respondent has requested only transparency and proper procedure—yet 
time continues to pass, compounding the damage. The situation remains stuck where it began, 
with the Court’s unexamined orders fueling Petitioner’s unscrupulous agenda at the children’s 
expense. This court now possesses all of the facts necessary to restore what has been wrongfully 
taken. 
VI. PRAYER FOR EXPEDITED RELIEF
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Respondent Charles Myers respectfully 
requests this Court grant the following expedited relief, in line with the children’s best interests: 
1. Order Respondent’s return to 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148, with the option
for Petitioner to cohabit or move next door while Respondent transitions to nearby housing and 
re-establishes his business. This arrangement corrects the current unjust separation and ensures 
both parents remain available to the children during the pendency of the case. 
2. The respondent respectfully requests that the court take notice that Petitioner’s counsel
has, at no point, engaged in discovery, conferred properly, or produced substantive filings in 
contravention of fundamental procedural rules.

BRIEF

Me

3:54 PM, Dec 16

Dan, I'm going to need you to put the money back that i need
to pay our bills and clear my account deficit.

| move money around all the time, which is evident in the
transaction records and has always been in the best interest
of all of us.

This most recent move was malicious and manipulative, and
has negatively impacted our financial situation.

You should be trying to help resolve this - not further
complicate it.

| cant order any presents this weekend for the girls.

| cant work due to mental anguish - also not good for the
girls.

All I've done is try to explain that we should work on this -
especially when you look at the
facts versus the narrative.

Morgan needs insurance on the car. My own insurance is
now late. Water bill is late- which threatens our auto-pay
setup.

Despite not understanding any of this and none of it making
sense - | still have to do what's in the best interest for
Morgan and the girls, as | always have so long as | was
aware of what | needed to be working on.

There's still time to turn this around - hash it out, and realize
that this family and those two girls and everything we've
done are worth fighting for.

I'll keep trying until | can't.

We can still save Christmas.
