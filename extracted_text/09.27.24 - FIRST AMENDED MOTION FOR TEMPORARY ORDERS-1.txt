NO. 322-744263-23 
IN THE 322ND DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
FOREWORD 
On January 16th, 2024, amid inclement weather, the Respondent was 
ordered to vacate the residency at a show cause hearing for an order of protection 
where a continuance was granted, and cause number 322-744263-23 was 
consolidated with cause number 322-744538-23 on the court’s own motion, and 
the case was reset to January 22nd, 2024, and then again for February 1st, 2024, 
where a settlement agreement was quickly drafted and Respondent was advised 
to sign it by his former counsel.  
This led to the subsequent termination of counsel, leaving Respondent to 
request an emergency hearing to vacate the associate judge’s report for temporary 
orders, which was the only hearing to date in this case after eight months. 
The unusual circumstances surrounding the initiation of this case warrant 
the court's reconsideration of the Respondent's original answer and subsequent 
briefs1 filed before the initial setting. Given the evolving facts and the clear 
foresight demonstrated in these earlier submissions, Respondent respectfully 
urges the court to revisit these filings in the interest of ensuring a just resolution.

CONCLUSION 
i. The Petitioner appeared before this Court on December 14, 2023,
requesting an ex-parte temporary order of protection, and subsequently filed a 
protective order on December 22, 2023. The Respondent contends that the 
Petitioner's narrative is an attempt to avoid accountability for her extramarital 
affairs which was discovered just prior to the initiation of her pleadings. 
ii. While the Petitioner engaged in activities outside the marriage, the
Respondent remained at home caring for the children. During the time the 
Petitioner pursued legal actions shortly before Christmas, the Respondent was 
preparing for the children's holiday. Since taking residence in the family home, 
the Petitioner has reportedly moved in her sister, reduced her employment to 
three hours per day, failed to complete the court-ordered parenting course, and is 
not contributing rent to her grandmother. The Respondent asserts that there is 
sufficient evidence on record to substantiate these claims, and predicted this exact 
outcome within his first pleadings within the clerk’s record, attached hereto. 
iii. The Respondent believes that this case has been conducted in the best
interest of the Petitioner rather than the children, a concern that has been 
repeatedly raised without response. The current orders in place are lack lawful 
foundation, and there has been minimal meaningful engagement from the 
Petitioner's attorney. The Respondent is concerned about the ongoing financial

existing arrangements as serving their best interests. 
iv. Granting this motion would initiate a long-overdue healing process. The
Petitioner should be required to explain her actions and be held accountable. The 
Respondent emphasizes the critical need for access to the residence to provide for 
the children while seeking alternative accommodations nearby. This need is 
argued to take precedence over the Petitioner's desire to protect herself from the

for his Children financially while the case is pending, the status quo will be

notice or hearing to the Petitioner, restoring the status quo for the 
children and enabling the Respondent to meet his financial 
obligations related to the Children and allow healing to begin.

residence at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, TX 76148 where he was 
wrongfully removed including the option for Petitioner to reside 
there as well if she so chooses.

Background Report for Case Consolidation

Case Details:

Divorce Case (Cause No. 322-744263-23) in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County, filed on
December 18, 2023.

Protective Order Case (Cause No. 322-744538-23) in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County.

Reasons for Consolidation:

Interconnected Issues:

The divorce case and the protective order case involve overlapping issues concerning family violence
allegations, which are central to the divorce proceedings and directly affect custody and visitation rights.
The protective order case includes allegations of family violence, which are also a pivotal point in the
divorce case in determining the waiver of the standard waiting period for the divorce.

Consistency in Rulings:

Consolidating the divorce and protective order cases would ensure consistency in the court's findings,
particularly regarding any allegations of family violence and their impact on the dissolution of marriage,
custody, and visitation rights.

Judicial Economy:

Hearing both cases together would promote judicial economy by avoiding duplication of legal
proceedings, as both cases are likely to involve similar witnesses, evidence, and legal arguments.

Claims of False Statements:

There have been claims of false statements and perjury related to the protective order, which could have
significant implications for the divorce case. For instance, the claim that the plaintiff intentionally lied
about being unable to pay court fees and made false allegations of family violence to gain an advantage
in the divorce proceedings suggests that a single judge should hear both matters for a clear
understanding of the facts.

Evidence of Misrepresentation and False Statements:

Evidence provided suggests that there have been misrepresentations to the court, including the transfer
of funds from the joint account and the plaintiff's interaction with third parties, which could affect both
the protective order and the divorce outcome. The protective order — which was based on claims of
family violence — are entirely baseless as | have no record of family violence, and no evidence from the
Plaintiff has been provided to substantiate these claims.

Landlord-Tenant Relationship:

The eviction case, although not directly related to family law matters, stems from claims and actions that
are deeply intertwined with the divorce and protective order cases, suggesting that the alleged family
violence and the actions of the plaintiff have been used to justify an eviction that coincides with the
timing of the divorce and protective order filings.

Conclusion:

Given the overlapping factual and legal issues in the divorce and protective order cases, consolidation
would serve the interests of justice and efficiency. It would ensure that the court has a comprehensive
understanding of the intertwined nature of the family's circumstances, which is vital for fair and
equitable resolution of these matters. While the eviction case may not be directly consolidated due to
jurisdictional differences, it should be considered in context with the other cases to provide a complete
picture of the ongoing disputes and to keep the best interests of our children intact.

Respectfully submitted,
Charles Myers

EXHIBIT A: TEMPORARY VISITATION ADJUSTMENT PROPOSAL

Respondent: Charles Dustin Myers

Understanding the intricate nature of our family's current situation and the legal complexities involved, |,
Charles Dustin Myers, propose a thoughtful adjustment to the visitation schedule that aligns with our
cohabiting status and the abrupt changes brought about by the divorce announcement.

1. Co-habitation Acknowledgement:

It is acknowledged that both parents currently cohabit, which com plicates traditional custody
arrangements. Therefore, the immediate priority is to facilitate a transition where both parties can
establish their respective independent living and working arrangements without disrupting the children's
lives.

2. Transition Period:

Morgan's Employment: Provide Morgan with the necessary support and time to secure stable
employment, which is vital for her to contribute to the children's needs and establish her own residence.

Stable Housing for Charles: As | seek stable housing to maintain my significant role in our daughters'
lives, flexibility in visitation is essential to ensure | continue to fulfill my parental duties.

3. Work and Research Commitments:

The concurrent legal proceedings, particularly those based on unverified claims, demand a substantial

amount of my time for research and preparation to protect the children's wel I-being.

My ability to work has been affected by the proceedings, necessitating an adjustment in my day-to-day

routine to accommodate these new responsibilities.

4. Interim Custody Logic:

Continuity for Children: While we navigate these proceedings, it is critical to maintain stability and
continuity for our children. Any temporary custody arrangements should reflect the least disruptive path

for them.

Counseling and Mediation: | strongly advocate for counseling or mediation to reconcile and navigate the
divorce process, emphasizing the children's best interests rather than abrupt and contentious changes.

5. Court's Facilitation:

The court's facilitation in endorsing a temporary and flexible visitation framework is crucial. This
framework must account for the current living situation and the significant emotional and logistical

upheaval that the divorce proceedings have caused.

This proposal is made in the spirit of cooperation, with a focus on minimizing the impact of our marital
dissolution on our children. It is with a sincere hope that we can transition into a stable co-parenting

arrangement that keeps our children's welfare as the priority.

Respectfully submitted,

Charles Dustin Myers

However, since December 2023, there has been a notable decline in the
reliability and efficiency of the service provided. This shift coincides with Mr.
Myers facing significant personal and legal challenges, including a divorce
proceeding that has drastically impacted his ability to operate his business
effectively. A particularly distressing development for Mr. Myers has been his
inability to access the physical location where his business equipment and
data connections are housed. This situation has not only disrupted the service
but has also imposed significant financial difficulties on Mr. Myers, threatening
the sustainability of the business and the quality of service that customers
have come to expect.

The repercussions of these challenges have been felt deeply by both Mr.
Myers and his clientele. While the community understands and sympathizes
with Mr. Myers’ personal struggles, the increasing service disruptions have
raised concerns among users about the future reliability and viability of the
service. We are hopeful for a resolution that will allow Mr. Myers to regain
access to his business infrastructure, thereby restoring the service quality and
reliability that we have valued highly. It is in the interest of both Mr. Myers and
his customers to find a solution that addresses these operational challenges
while supporting him through his personal difficulties, ensuring the long-term
success and sustainability of the service.

I'm signing this affidavit to attest to the work ethic and
dedication of Charles Myers. I've come to rely on the
services he provides in order to gather the required data to
make educated decisions on what and when to enter/exit
options positions. Recently due to him not being at his
normal location of operations the services have had multiple
down times in which Charles was not in a position to be able
to remedy. Some of these down times have led to significant
losses due to making decisions without the necessary data
after already being entered in a position.

I subscribed for an extensive education program under Charles Myers to gain expertise in

mentor, has been instrumental in inspiring myself and numerous others to independently
pursue knowledge in the field of financial data. The instability in Charles Myers' living
situation has adversely affected his ability to fulfill his work commitments to the best of

his capacity. This instability has had a significant impact on my ability to efficiently learn

and absorb the subject matter, as Charles Myers is unable to work full time from his

Affidavit

THE STATE OF _Gatifornia

COUNTY OF Orange

The person who signed this affidavit, appeared in person, before me, the

undersigned notary, and stated under oath:

My name is Nicholas Glen Morvan ;

| am of sound mind and capable of making this statement. | have personal knowledge of
the facts written in this statement. | understand that if | lie in this statement, | may be held
criminally responsible. This statement is true and correct.

| am a paying customer of Charles Myers for the past two years and four months. In this time, he has been
working exclusively out of his home office to run his business, and provide for his family.

Charles has worked very hard for the past two years to provide a quality experience that benefits

all of his customers. His ability to provide these services have been directly impacted by his inability to

access his home office. As a result, my experience as a customer has suffered, and | am not receiving

the level of service that | have been paying for. | understand that there are unfortunate circumstances

and | am patient while Charles resolves his situation. He has been incredibly apologetic that he cannot

provide the same level of quality, and uninterrupted service due to his inability to work out of his home

office. | do not question his integrity with regards to this situation, he has always been honest and upfront

with myself and others. My hope is that he may return to his home office in order to avoid shutting down
