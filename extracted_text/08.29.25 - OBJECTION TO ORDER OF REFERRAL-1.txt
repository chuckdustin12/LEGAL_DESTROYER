TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THIS COURT:
Respondent, Charles Dustin Myers, respectfully OBJECTS to the

order of referral signed on August 29, 2025, and in support there of, shows the

court the following:

I. Summary

1. It is procedurally improper for a court coordinator to forward an order of
referral for recusal based solely on a notice of intent to file a recusal, as Texas law
requires a formal, verified motion to trigger the recusal process, and the
coordinator has no statutory authority to act in this capacity. The continued

involvement of the coordinator in recusal matters undermines the integrity of the

process and deviates from the mandatory procedures established by Texas statutes 
and case law. 
 
2. Under Texas law, the recusal process is strictly governed by statute and 
rule, requiring a formal, verified motion to be filed before any judicial or 
administrative action is taken. A mere notice of intent to file a recusal does not 
initiate the recusal process, and the court coordinator has no legal authority to 
forward orders of referral or otherwise participate in the assignment of judges for 
recusal motions. 
 
3. The responsibility for handling recusal motions lies exclusively with the 
judge and, upon referral, the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district. 
The involvement of a court coordinator in forwarding orders of referral—
especially in the absence of a formal motion—contravenes both the letter and spirit 
of the law, as confirmed by controlling statutes and appellate decisions. This 
improper involvement risks undermining the impartiality and public confidence in 
the judiciary that the recusal process is designed to protect. 
II. Background and Relevant Law 
 
4. The Texas Government Code and Texas Rules of Civil Procedure set out a 
detailed and mandatory process for judicial recusal. Under Tex. Gov't. Code § 
25.00255, the presiding judge of the administrative judicial region is vested with

process and deviates from the mandatory procedures established by Texas statutes

and case law.

2. Under Texas law, the recusal process is strictly governed by statute and

II. Background and Relevant Law

4. The Texas Government Code and Texas Rules of Civil Procedure set out a
detailed and mandatory process for judicial recusal. Under Tex. Gov't. Code §

25.00255, the presiding judge of the administrative judicial region is vested with

the authority to hear or assign a judge to hear a referred motion for recusal or 
disqualification. The statute does not mention or authorize any role for a court 
coordinator in this process, underscoring that the responsibility is judicial, not 
administrative. 
 
5. Similarly, Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 30.016 addresses the procedure 
for tertiary recusal motions, requiring the judge to continue presiding over the case 
but to comply with all applicable rules for recusal and disqualification. Again, 
there is no provision for a court coordinator to act in this context. 
 
6. The Texas Administrative Code, at 1 Tex. Admin. Code § 155.152, further 
clarifies that a motion to recuse must be verified, state particular grounds, and be 
based on personal knowledge. Only upon the filing of such a motion do the 
procedural requirements for recusal arise. 
III. Analysis 
A. The Legal Effect of a Notice of Intent to File Recusal 
 
7. A notice of intent to file a recusal is not a recusal motion. The Texas Rules 
of Civil Procedure, specifically Rule 18a, and the Texas Administrative Code 
require that a motion to recuse be verified, state with particularity the grounds for 
recusal, and be based on personal knowledge. Only upon the filing of such a 
motion do the procedural requirements for recusal arise . See Tex. Admin. Code §

the authority to hear or assign a judge to hear a referred motion for recusal or
disqualification. The statute does not mention or authorize any role for a court
coordinator in this process, underscoring that the responsibility is judicial, not

7. A notice of intent to file a recusal is not a recusal motion. The Texas Rules
of Civil Procedure, specifically Rule 18a, and the Texas Administrative Code

155.152; In re Marriage of Samford, 173 S.W.3d 887 (Tex. 2005); In re Johnson, 
No. 14-04-00519-CV (Tex. 2004)). A notice of intent does not satisfy these 
requirements and does not trigger the judge's duty to recuse or refer. 
B. The Role of the Court Coordinator 
 
8. The statutory and procedural framework for recusal is explicit in 
assigning responsibility to the judge and, upon referral, the presiding judge of the 
administrative judicial district (Tex. Gov't. Code § 25.00255; In re Alpert, 276 
S.W.3d 592 (Tex. App. 2008)). The court coordinator is not mentioned in any 
statute or rule as having authority to forward orders of referral or otherwise 
participate in the recusal process. The coordinator's involvement, especially in the 
absence of a formal motion, is therefore unauthorized and improper.  
 
9. This is not a mere technicality. The recusal process is designed to ensure 
impartiality and public confidence in the judiciary. Allowing a court coordinator—
who is not a judicial officer and may be perceived as aligned with the sitting 
judge—to participate in the process risks undermining the appearance and reality 
of impartiality. 
 
10. The continued involvement of the court coordinator in forwarding orders 
of referral, particularly in the absence of a formal recusal motion, is not only 
unauthorized but also risks creating the appearance of impropriety or bias. This is

unauthorized but also risks creating the appearance of impropriety or bias. This is

precisely what the recusal process is designed to avoid (Sears v. Nueces County 
Sherriff Olivarez, 28 S.W.3d 611 (Tex. App. 2000); Sun Exploration and 
Production Co. v. Jackson, 783 S.W.2d 202 (Tex. 1989)). The Texas Supreme 
Court has repeatedly emphasized that the less a judge (or by extension, court staff) 
is involved in recusal proceedings, the better, to maintain the integrity of the 
process (Union Pacific Resources Co., In re, 969 S.W.2d 427 (Tex. 1998)).  
 
11. There are no exceptions in the provided authorities that would permit a 
court coordinator to act in the recusal process in the absence of a formal, verified 
motion. The only administrative role contemplated is that of the court clerk, who is 
responsible for delivering documents to the relevant judges once a motion or order 
is filed (Pretrial motions, None). Any deviation from this process is not supported 
by statute, rule, or case law. 
IV. Conclusion 
 
12. In summary, Texas law is clear that the recusal process is triggered only 
by the filing of a formal, verified motion, and that the responsibility for handling 
such motions lies exclusively with the judge and, upon referral, the presiding judge 
of the administrative judicial district. The court coordinator has no statutory or 
procedural authority to forward orders of referral or otherwise participate in the 
recusal process, especially in the absence of a formal motion. The continued

involvement of the coordinator in these matters is improper and undermines the 
integrity and impartiality of the judicial process. The court should ensure strict 
compliance with the established procedures to maintain public confidence in the 
judiciary, and vacate the Order of Referral until and unless a statutorily proper 
recusal is filed.

Respondent therefore OBJECTS to the order of referral signed on August 29, 2025.
