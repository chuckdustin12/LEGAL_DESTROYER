NO. 322-744263-23 
IN THE 322nd DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
TO THE HONORABLE COURT: 
On March 17, 2025, I reminded the court coordinator that Hon. Munford and Hon.  
Kaitcer had not been reinstated to the case. (See motion to recuse, TAB E) After four months of  
waiting and proactively communicating to this court that my youngest daughter was  
suffering medical neglect, time was of the essence, and I opened a separate SAPCR suit on the  
grounds that this case had been procedurally abandoned by the opposing party, as at the time of 
filing – there had been a pending DWOP motion that still remains un-opposed filed on January  
17, 2024.

Respondent.

TO THE HONORABLE COURT:

On March 17, 2025, I reminded the court coordinator that Hon. Munford and Hon.

Kaitcer had not been reinstated to the case. (See motion to recuse, TAB E) After four months of

waiting and proactively communicating to this court that my youngest daughter was

suffering medical neglect, time was of the essence, and I opened a separate SAPCR suit on the

grounds that this case had been procedurally abandoned by the opposing party, as at the time of

filing — there had been a pending DWOP motion that still remains un-opposed filed on January

17, 2024.

I filed an EMERGENCY TRO with the court on March 24, 2024, and never received  
any response, and was turned away at the last hour because of COOPER L. CARTER’s 
inability to follow the Texas Rules of Procedure and consistent unethical behavior. She used a  
forward consolidation motion to block emergency relief, and filed it a week later. Despite turning 
the emergency TRO away, the same court sua sponte granted COOPER L. CARTER’S  
consolidation motion without a hearing, and now this court intends to proceed to set this matter 
for final trial. 
Now, today – Petitioner texts and informs me that my daughter, C.R.M., has to have  
EMERGENCY surgery with anesthesia because of the collective actions undertaken by both 
courts and the opposing counsel. EXHIBIT 1 This operation is expected to cost $2,584 and is the 
exact reason why the EMERGENCY TRO was filed.  
The direct and foreseeable result of the Petitioner’s failure to act in the children’s best 
interests, and the Court’s failure to address the emergency relief sought has now materialized, 
causing both irreparable harm to my daughter and significant financial injury. This Court had full 
notice of the risks to the minor child’s health and chose, instead, to prioritize procedural 
manipulation over the welfare of the children involved and give deference to an attorney who has 
abandoned the case outright.

emergency surgery — and its associated cost of $2,584 — could have been avoided, the rights of
