TO THE HONORABLE DAVID L. EVANS OF THE 8° ADMINISTRATIVE REGION
OF TEXAS:

COMES NOW, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, Respondent Pro Se, and files this
Objection to the "ORDER OF ASSIGNMENT BY THE PRESIDING JUDGE" signed on May 6,
2025 (hereinafter "Order of Assignment"), in the above-referenced cause, and in support thereof
would respectfully show the Court the following:

I. BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

1. On April 28, 2025, Respondent Charles Dustin Myers filed his "FIRST AMENDED

MOTION TO RECUSE" (hereinafter "Amended Recusal Motion"). This Amended Recusal

Motion specifically sought the recusal of the Honorable James Munford, presiding judge of the

M.3152 M.3152

2 
 
322nd District Court, based upon grounds detailed therein and pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil 
Procedure 18b. 
2. Crucially, the Amended Recusal Motion filed on April 28, 2025, named only the 
Honorable James Munford as the judge whose recusal was sought. It did not seek the recusal of 
the Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer. 
3. Prior to the issuance of the Order of Assignment, on April 29, 2025, Respondent filed 
an "OBJECTION – RECUSAL PROCEDURE." Exhibit A. This objection explicitly brought to 
the attention of the Eighth Administrative Judicial Region that, among other procedural 
irregularities, the Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer was being improperly implicated in recusal 
proceedings related to the Amended Recusal Motion, as said motion did not name him. The 
objection highlighted that any action by Judge Kaitcer concerning the Amended Recusal Motion 
(which did not seek his recusal) was procedurally incorrect and suggested that the motion itself 
had not been substantively reviewed before such erroneous actions were taken. 
4.  Subsequently, on May 6, 2025, the Presiding Judge of the Eighth Administrative 
Judicial Region issued the Order of Assignment. This Order assigns the Honorable John H. 
Cayce to preside in and rule on: 
i.  "the Motion to Recuse the Honorable James Munford and the Honorable Jeffrey 
Kaitcer filed by Charles Dustin Myers on April 25, 2025" and 
ii. "the First Amended Motion to Recuse the Honorable James Munford and the 
Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer filed on April 28, 2025." – Exhibit B 
 
5.  Despite Respondent’s objections, the Court Coordinator for the 322nd District Court 
has continued to be involved in the administrative handling and communication regarding these 
recusal proceedings.

II. ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES 
The Order of Assignment dated May 6, 2025, is procedurally defective and based on a 
fundamental mischaracterization of the pending Amended Recusal Motion, particularly as it 
pertains to the Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer. 
1. Mischaracterization of the Operative Pleading 
The Order of Assignment incorrectly states that the "First Amended Motion to Recuse... 
filed on April 28, 2025" sought the recusal of both Judge Munford and Judge Kaitcer. This is 
factually incorrect. The Amended Recusal Motion filed by Respondent on that date sought only 
the recusal of Judge Munford. 
2. Violation of TRCP 18a Requirements 
     
i. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(a) governs the filing of a motion to recuse. It 
requires that such a motion "must be verified and must state with particularity the grounds why 
the judge should be recused or disqualified and the specific provision of Rule 18b or other law 
relied on." 
     
ii. A motion to recuse is specific to the judge whose recusal is sought. If the Amended 
Recusal Motion did not name Judge Kaitcer, then there was no valid, pending motion seeking 
Judge Kaitcer’s recusal before the Presiding Judge of the Administrative Judicial Region upon 
which an assignment could be based. 
     
iii. Under TRCP 18a(f)(1), it is the "respondent judge" (the judge whose recusal is sought 
in a filed motion) who must either recuse or refer the motion. If Judge Kaitcer was not the 
respondent judge in the Amended Recusal Motion, he had no authority to take any action 
regarding that specific motion. 
    
 iv. Consequently, any referral or assignment based on the premise that the Amended 
Recusal Motion targeted Judge Kaitcer is without proper foundation under TRCP 18a.

Il. ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES

The Order of Assignment dated May 6, 2025, is procedurally defective and based on a
fundamental mischaracterization of the pending Amended Recusal Motion, particularly as it
pertains to the Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer.
1. Mischaracterization of the Operative Pleading

The Order of Assignment incorrectly states that the "First Amended Motion to Recuse...
filed on April 28, 2025" sought the recusal of both Judge Munford and Judge Kaitcer. This is
factually incorrect. The Amended Recusal Motion filed by Respondent on that date sought only
the recusal of Judge Munford.

2. Violation of TRCP 18a Requirements
i. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(a) governs the filing of a motion to recuse. It

requires that such a motion "must be verified and must state with particularity the grounds why
the judge should be recused or disqualified and the specific provision of Rule 18b or other law
relied on."

ii. A motion to recuse is specific to the judge whose recusal is sought. If the Amended
Recusal Motion did not name Judge Kaitcer, then there was no valid, pending motion seeking
Judge Kaitcer’s recusal before the Presiding Judge of the Administrative Judicial Region upon
which an assignment could be based.

iii. Under TRCP 18a(f)(1), it is the "respondent judge" (the judge whose recusal is sought
in a filed motion) who must either recuse or refer the motion. If Judge Kaitcer was not the
respondent judge in the Amended Recusal Motion, he had no authority to take any action
regarding that specific motion.

iv. Consequently, any referral or assignment based on the premise that the Amended

Recusal Motion targeted Judge Kaitcer is without proper foundation under TRCP 18a.

3.  Improper Involvement of Court Coordinator in Recusal Process 
     
i. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a meticulously details the procedural steps for recusal 
and disqualification of judges. TRCP 18a(e) specifically assigns duties related to the handling 
and delivery of recusal motions, responses, and orders of recusal or referral to the **"clerk of the 
court." 
     
ii. TRCP 18a(e)(1) states: "When a motion or response is filed, the **clerk of the court** 
must immediately deliver a copy to the respondent judge and to the presiding judge of the 
administrative judicial region..." 
     
iii. TRCP 18a(e)(2) states: "When a respondent judge signs and files an order of recusal 
or referral, the **clerk of the court** must immediately deliver a copy to the regional presiding 
judge." 
     
iv. Significantly, TRCP Rule 18a makes no mention of the "court coordinator" and assigns 
no duties, responsibilities, or authority to a court coordinator in the recusal or disqualification 
process. The rule is explicit in its assignment of these administrative tasks to the "clerk of the 
court." 
     
v. The legal principle of expressio unius est exclusio alterius (the express mention of one 
thing excludes all others) suggests that where a procedural rule details the roles of specific court 
personnel (the clerk) and omits others (the court coordinator), the omitted personnel do not have 
an official, mandated role in that specific process under that rule. 
     
vi. The continued handling of any aspect of this recusal proceeding by the Court 
Coordinator, particularly after Respondent has objected to such involvement, is therefore outside 
the procedural framework established by TRCP 18a and is improper. Such actions usurp the

3. Improper Involvement of Court Coordinator in Recusal Process

i. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a meticulously details the procedural steps for recusal
and disqualification of judges. TRCP 18a(e) specifically assigns duties related to the handling
and delivery of recusal motions, responses, and orders of recusal or referral to the **"clerk of the
court."

i. TRCP 18a(e)(1) states: "When a motion or response is filed, the **clerk of the court**
must immediately deliver a copy to the respondent judge and to the presiding judge of the
administrative judicial region..."

iii. TRCP 18a(e)(2) states: "When a respondent judge signs and files an order of recusal
or referral, the **clerk of the court** must immediately deliver a copy to the regional presiding
judge."

iv. Significantly, TRCP Rule 18a makes no mention of the "court coordinator" and assigns
no duties, responsibilities, or authority to a court coordinator in the recusal or disqualification
process. The rule is explicit in its assignment of these administrative tasks to the "clerk of the
court."

v. The legal principle of expressio unius est exclusio alterius (the express mention of one
thing excludes all others) suggests that where a procedural rule details the roles of specific court
personnel (the clerk) and omits others (the court coordinator), the omitted personnel do not have

an official, mandated role in that specific process under that rule.

vi. The continued handling of any aspect of this recusal proceeding by the Court
Coordinator, particularly after Respondent has objected to such involvement, is therefore outside

the procedural framework established by TRCP 18a and is improper. Such actions usurp the

duties explicitly assigned to the clerk of the court and can compromise the neutrality and 
integrity of the recusal process. 
4. Prior Objection Put Region on Notice
The "OBJECTION – RECUSAL PROCEDURE" filed by Respondent on April 29, 2025, 
explicitly notified the Administrative Region of the error regarding Judge Kaitcer’s involvement 
before the Order of Assignment was issued. The subsequent issuance of the Order of Assignment, 
which perpetuates this error by incorrectly including Judge Kaitcer as a subject of the Amended 
Recusal Motion, demonstrates that the prior objection and the contents of the Amended Recusal 
Motion itself may not have been fully considered. This failure to address a clearly articulated 
procedural defect undermines the integrity and due process of the recusal procedure outlined in 
TRCP 18a. 
5. Prejudice to Respondent
Proceeding based on the current Order of Assignment would require Respondent to 
address recusal issues concerning Judge Kaitcer that were not raised in the operative Amended 
Recusal Motion, thereby misdirecting judicial resources and prejudicing Respondent by forcing 
litigation on a non-existent claim within that specific pleading. 
III. RELIEF REQUESTED
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Respondent Charles Dustin Myers 
respectfully requests that the Honorable David L. Evans, Presiding Judge of the Eighth 
Administrative Judicial Region: 
1. VACATE or AMEND the Order of Assignment dated May 6, 2025, to correctly reflect
that the "First Amended Motion to Recuse" filed on April 28, 2025, seeks only the recusal 
of the Honorable James Munford;

II. ISSUE 
 
There are two significant procedural errors that must be immediately addressed. 
First, Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure does not authorize or delegate any 
responsibility for handling recusal matters to the court coordinator. Despite an explicit and timely 
objection to the coordinator's involvement outlined within the pending recusal motion itself, the 
coordinator continues to improperly manage and influence the referral process. This 
unauthorized participation represents a fundamental procedural violation that undermines the 
neutrality and integrity of the recusal proceedings. 
Second, the involvement of Hon. Jeffrey Kaitcer in the current referral is entirely 
improper and unnecessary, as the current motion for recusal specifically and explicitly names 
only Hon. James Munford as the respondent judge. While the current motion does reference a 
prior joint recusal motion historically—where Hon. Kaitcer was previously named—that 
reference is strictly contextual and does not constitute a renewed or active request for his recusal 
at this juncture. The plain language and explicit identification in the current motion leave no 
reasonable ambiguity that the recusal sought at present involves only Judge Munford. Therefore, 
Judge Kaitcer’s unilateral decision to decline recusal and issue a referral, despite no pending 
recusal against him, is procedurally incorrect and strongly suggests the motion itself was not 
reviewed substantively before action was taken. 
These procedural missteps—the continued improper involvement of the court coordinator 
and the erroneous implication of a second judge—constitute clear violations of Rule 18a, 
compromise the impartiality required by judicial ethics, and further evidence that due diligence 
was not exercised in considering the motion as filed.

III. APPLICATION OF LAW 
 
A trial court has no discretion in determining what the law is or applying the law to the 
facts even when the law is unsettled. In re Prudential, 148 S.W.3d at 135. Consequently, a clear 
failure by the trial court to analyze or apply the law correctly will constitute an abuse of 
discretion. Walker v Packer, 827 S.W.2d at 840 (Tex.1992). Here, the continuous disregard for 
the undersigned’s pleadings, the Texas Constitution, the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and the 
Texas Family Code has resulted in cumulative and severe harm: a minor child has sustained 
preventable injury due solely to judicial inaction; the Petitioner continues to evade adjudication 
despite credible, unrefuted, and well-documented allegations of fraud; and opposing counsel—
who has never substantively responded to any pleading nor demonstrated her authority to act 
pursuant to Rule 12—continues to receive judicial favor, undermining fundamental due process 
protections. This persistent tolerance for procedural irregularities denies the undersigned equal 
protection under law and creates a significant risk of ongoing and future delays, as every action 
undertaken by this unauthorized attorney remains vulnerable to being stricken or invalidated. 
Consequently, the judicial process has become one that incentivizes silence, penalizes diligence, 
and leaves vulnerable children exposed to avoidable and foreseeable harm. Moreover, this 
conduct demonstrates an unacceptable level of bias: a judge who was never implicated in the 
present recusal motion has inexplicably involved himself without justification, the court 
coordinator improperly continues to perform roles for which she has no lawful authority, and 
Texas law is repeatedly misapplied, consistently to the detriment of the undersigned and his 
children. This troubling pattern of behavior erodes public trust, compromises judicial integrity, 
and necessitates immediate corrective action.

present recusal motion has inexplicably involved himself without justification, the court
coordinator improperly continues to perform roles for which she has no lawful authority, and
Texas law is repeatedly misapplied, consistently to the detriment of the undersigned and his
children. This troubling pattern of behavior erodes public trust, compromises judicial integrity,

and necessitates immediate corrective action.

IV. CONCLUSION 
The issues necessitating this recusal are precisely the errors and procedural misconduct 
outlined herein. The Court has repeatedly issued perfunctory orders lacking any substantive legal 
explanation, mirroring the persistent silence and inaction of the opposing counsel. No valid legal 
justification has been offered to explain the sustained disregard for the Texas Rules of Civil 
Procedure, the Texas Family Code, and fundamental principles of due process. The undersigned 
respectfully reiterates that this is a Family Law proceeding—one that profoundly impacts 
children and families—not a venue for procedural indifference or selective enforcement. At a 
minimum, the Court must adhere strictly and impartially to the established rules and procedural 
requirements. Unless and until there is clear evidence that the pending Motion to Recuse has 
been properly and substantively reviewed and considered, the undersigned expressly objects to 
any scheduling of further hearings or proceedings in this matter. This objection is filed not out of 
disrespect, but rather out of necessity and urgency, to document and bring attention to continued 
procedural irregularities and judicial oversights that have compromised the fairness and integrity 
of this case. The undersigned seeks only the due process and equal protection to which all 
litigants are entitled, and which the record thus far has conspicuously failed to reflect.
