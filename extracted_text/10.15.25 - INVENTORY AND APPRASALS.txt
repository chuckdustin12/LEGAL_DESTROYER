Business Valuation Impact:

Critical Business Assets

Impact Statement 
 
The business operations have been severely disrupted due to lack of access to the 
specialized internet connection and technical setup at the home address. This disruption occurred 
precisely as the business was ready to scale as a SaaS/tech platform, resulting in the loss of the 
ability to serve clients, monetize new features (including Discord bots and mobile applications),

The person who signed this affidavit, appeared in person, before me, the

My name is Nicholas Glen Morvan ;

| am of sound mind and capable of making this statement. | have personal knowledge of
the facts written in this statement. | understand that if | lie in this statement, | may be held
criminally responsible. This statement is true and correct.

| am a paying customer of Charles Myers for the past two years and four months. In this time, he has been
working exclusively out of his home office to run his business, and provide for his family.

Charles has worked very hard for the past two years to provide a quality experience that benefits

all of his customers. His ability to provide these services have been directly impacted by his inability to

access his home office. As a result, my experience as a customer has suffered, and | am not receiving

the level of service that | have been paying for. | understand that there are unfortunate circumstances

and | am patient while Charles resolves his situation. He has been incredibly apologetic that he cannot

provide the same level of quality, and uninterrupted service due to his inability to work out of his home

office. | do not question his integrity with regards to this situation, he has always been honest and upfront

with myself and others. My hope is that he may return to his home office in order to avoid shutting down

I subscribed for an extensive education program under Charles Myers to gain expertise in
reading and researching market data. Charles Myers, a dedicated father, teacher, and
mentor, has been instrumental in inspiring myself and numerous others to independently
pursue knowledge in the field of financial data. The instability in Charles Myers' living
situation has adversely affected his ability to fulfill his work commitments to the best of

his capacity. This instability has had a significant impact on my ability to efficiently learn

and absorb the subject matter, as Charles Myers is unable to work full time from his

home office. Charles Myers requires a meticulously crafted computer setup to efficiently

manage and process extensive data sets and resource-intensive programs essential for his

work in market research and education. The consequence of Charles Myers' restricted

This statement serves as a formal declaration of my support for Mr. Charles Myers in light

hardworking nature and commitment to excellence. Mr. Myers's dedication to improving both his
personal capabilities and the quality of his products has been the comerstone of his reputation.
The denial of Mr. Myers's access to his home has not only caused significant service

disruptons but has also resulted in considerable financial losses for Mr. Myers, myself, and other
paying clients that rely on the services that he offers. As someone directly affected by this

However, since December 2023, there has been a notable decline in the
reliability and efficiency of the service provided. This shift coincides with Mr.
Myers facing significant personal and legal challenges, including a divorce
proceeding that has drastically impacted his ability to operate his business
effectively. A particularly distressing development for Mr. Myers has been his
inability to access the physical location where his business equipment and
data connections are housed. This situation has not only disrupted the service
but has also imposed significant financial difficulties on Mr. Myers, threatening
the sustainability of the business and the quality of service that customers
have come to expect.

The repercussions of these challenges have been felt deeply by both Mr.
Myers and his clientele. While the community understands and sympathizes
with Mr. Myers’ personal struggles, the increasing service disruptions have
raised concerns among users about the future reliability and viability of the
service. We are hopeful for a resolution that will allow Mr. Myers to regain
access to his business infrastructure, thereby restoring the service quality and
reliability that we have valued highly. It is in the interest of both Mr. Myers and
his customers to find a solution that addresses these operational challenges
while supporting him through his personal difficulties, ensuring the long-term
success and sustainability of the service.
