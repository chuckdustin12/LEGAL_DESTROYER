Petitioner,

Emergency Motion to Reconsider
Evidence and to Vacate Temporary
Orders

Charles Dustin Myers,

Respondent

This motion urgently calls for the Court's intervention to address critical procedural
missteps in the matter of cause# 322-744263-23, aiming to reinstate the safety and stability
that our children rightfully deserve until due process and all facts of the case can be considered
by the Court. I am seeking immediate court intervention to correct procedural errors and
address the misuse of the legal system by the Petitioner. This motion highlights the significant
impact of the Petitioner's actions on our children's welfare and my unjust removal from our
home based on frivolous claims.

In pursuit of justice and the well-being of the children at heart, I respectfully request that
the Court reconsider all details, weighing the comprehensive scenario presented herein along
with the supporting evidence. I am committed to the highest interests of my children and
family, striving to resolve these matters efficiently and avoid unnecessary judicial expenditure.
This document seeks to unveil the Petitioner’s deliberate misrepresentation and misuse of the
legal system, which has gravely disrupted our children's stability and emotional well-being by
weaponizing the court system.

1 On December 1st, 2023, the Petitioner announced her desire for a divorce with no plan in place to preserve our
familial stability, with no desire for counseling or communication, and with no consideration of the timing around
the holiday season, nor any sign of marital discord warranting such a decision leading up to this announcement.

2 Between December 14th, 2023, and December 22nd, 2023, the Petitioner filed for an Emergency Protective
Order, a Divorce Petition, a Protective Order, and instigated an Eviction suit.

NATURE OF SUITS AND THIRD-PARTY INFLUENCE 
1. On December 1st, 2023, Petitioner announced the divorce with no plan in place for the 
children, no sign of marital discord leading up to this point to warrant such a decision, 
and no desire for counseling, communication, and no consideration for the time of year.  
 
2. Between December 1st, 2023, and December 12th, 2023, all efforts are exhausted in an 
attempt to communicate with the Petitioner which lead to the subsequent discovery of an 
alarming volume of text messages that were directed towards two individuals – Debbie 
Price and Damen Kazlauskas, showing a significant level of influence.³ 
 
 
3. On December 12th, 2023, After the discovery of the communications between these two 
individuals combined with the irrational behavior from the Petitioner during such a 
critical time of year, I reached out to the Petitioner’s grandfather via text message.⁴ 
 
4. On December 13th, 2023, Petitioner states she will be going to talk to her Grandparents 
alone. This conversation lasts between 9:55 and 1:30 A.M. 
 
 
5. On December 14th, 2023, Petitioner filed for an Emergency Protective Order. This order 
was denied by the court.  
 
6. On December 15th, 2023, Petitioner involves her family into the situation.       
Particularly, Dan Branthoover became involved. He is the boyfriend of the Petitioner’s 
Mother. Shortly thereafter, I received a notice from our joint bank account stating that 
$1,576 had just been withdrawn. As our bank statement for December 2023 will 
demonstrate – the transaction record shows the funds being transferred directly to Mr. 
Branthoover’s PayPal account.⁵

FRIVOLOUS CLAIMS AND FALSE STATEMENTS 
A. EMERGENCY PROTECTIVE ORDER 
1. As mentioned above, Petitioner filed for an Emergency Protective Order on 
December 14th, 2023. This protective order was denied by the courts. 
2. Due to the fact this order was not granted by the court, one could conclude that 
there was not a clear and present danger of family violence.¹ 
B. THE DIVORCE PETITION 
1. Petition was filed on 2024-12-18 under an Affidavit of Inability to pay.² 
2. The Petitioner's action of filing for divorce under an Affidavit of Inability to pay 
three days after transferring $1,576 to herself starkly contravenes the mandates 
set forth in Chapter 10, Section 10.001 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code. This 
section asserts that each claim or legal contention must be warranted by existing 
law or a nonfrivolous argument for the modification of existing law or the 
establishment of new law, and that each factual contention has or is likely to have 
evidentiary support after further investigation or discovery³.  
3. The Petitioner violated Chapter 10, Section 10.001 a second time within the 
same document when she intentionally elected to waive the 60-day waiting 
period claiming to have an active protective order against me that found family 
violence had occurred during our marriage⁴ despite being denied such an order 
just five days prior on December 14th, 2023.  
5. The final page of the Divorce Petition for service to the Office of the Attorney 
General was left unsigned by the Petitioner.

C. EVICTION SUIT 
1. The suit was unlawful by nature⁵, as the grounds for eviction were based on 
family status, referencing the divorce as well as a protective order that had been 
denied on December 14th, 2023. The suit was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction on 
January 17th, 2024.⁶ 
 
D. PROTECTIVE ORDER 
1. This suit was the second attempt by the Petitioner to have me removed from 
the home, which ultimately succeeded.  
2. The claims within this suit mentioned sexually aggressive comments and 
threatening behavior. These allegations are materially false, as the Petitioner 
possesses no evidence, and has presented no evidence in relation to these claims 
since the initiation of the suit. Despite this, as video and image evidence will show 
once a fair trial date is set, the Petitioner and I continued to maintain stability at 
our family home and preserved the sense of normalcy that our daughters have 
been accustomed to their entire lives up until January 16th, 2024. 
 
The Court's decision to remove me from my home and my children’s lives on January 
16th, 2024, albeit preliminary and unjustified, bypassed the safeguarding of the children's 
emotional, psychological, and physical well-being. This oversight is compounded by the 
Petitioner's actions. The juxtaposition of the Court's decision against the backdrop of the 
Petitioner's inattention to the children's needs illuminates a disconcerting disregard for the 
paramount principle that custody determinations should primarily serve the children's best 
interests. The final section of this motion will highlight the procedural aspects of the events 
unfolding between the dates of January 16th, 2024, and February 1st, 2024, and pray the court 
will rectify this situation by restoring the stability to our family by vacating the current 
temporary orders that are in place until a proper investigation can be completed by the courts.

THE PROTECTIVE ORDER HEARINGS 
1. In preparation for the Protective Order hearing on January 16th, 2024, I filed with the 
Court an answer to the Protective Order on January 2nd, 2024 as well as two motions – a 
motion to consolidate the divorce with the protective order, filed on January 4th, 2024, as 
well as a motion of continuance, filed on January 8th, 2024 for the purpose to acquire 
counsel due to the complex nature of the case.¹ All three filings were accepted by the 
court.  
 
2. On January 16th, 2024, both parties sought additional time to secure legal 
representation. Despite not reviewing any evidence, witness testimonies, or documents 
related to the motions, and acknowledging the denial of a previous Emergency Protective 
Order, the court mandated my departure from our home within four hours. This 
decision, unexpectedly made, awarded custody to the Petitioner, overlooking my 
concerns about the adverse effects on our children and my work from home. This ruling, 
which both parties did not sign, set the case to resume on January 22nd, 2024, to allow 
time for obtaining counsel.² 
 
3. Following the court's directive, I relocated to my father's residence in Flower Mound until 
the subsequent hearing. During this interval, the Petitioner did not take the initiative to 
have the children call once and did not provide any information as to how they were 
doing, showcasing her lack of empathy and concern for our children’s well-being and 
stability. After incurring substantial expenses to secure representation, I detailed my case 
and concerns to my attorney, preparing for the next court appearance. 
 
4. On January 22nd, 2024, the Petitioner chose to seek legal representation just minutes 
before the hearing was due to start, indicating a disregard for the process. My lawyer 
recommended agreeing to a continuance, thereby extending the period I couldn't work 
and impacting our established family dynamics. This resulted in a third hearing being set 
for February 1st, coinciding with my birthday, and a second rendition being ordered.³

5. On February 1st, 2024, during the third hearing, the substantive issues I had raised were 
not addressed, nor was there any exchange of evidence between our legal representatives. 
Despite the focus of the hearing supposed to be on the protective order, the discussions 
veered into custody and child support matters. My lawyer presented the sole option of a 
temporary return to the family home for 30 days with expanded visitation rights, coupled 
with a child support obligation starting in April. This outcome, which diverged significantly 
from the case's core issues, compelled me to reconsider my legal representation. 
Consequently, I decided to terminate my attorney's services and embarked on drafting this 
motion myself, aiming to bring the court's attention back to the pivotal elements of the case 
that had thus far been neglected while able to legally reside in my home. 
 
CONCLUSION AND PRAYER 
In conclusion, this motion has laid bare the stark realities and procedural aberrations that have 
marred the essence of justice and due process in the matter of Cause No. 322-744263-23. 
Through the course of these proceedings, it has become abundantly clear that the actions taken 
by the Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, have not only disregarded the welfare and best 
interests of our children but have also illuminated her unfitness as a parent. Her actions speak 
to a pattern of deceit, manipulation, and an unsettling willingness to leverage the judicial

5. On February 1st, 2024, during the third hearing, the substantive issues I had raised were
not addressed, nor was there any exchange of evidence between our legal representatives.
Despite the focus of the hearing supposed to be on the protective order, the discussions
veered into custody and child support matters. My lawyer presented the sole option of a
temporary return to the family home for 30 days with expanded visitation rights, coupled
with a child support obligation starting in April. This outcome, which diverged significantly
from the case's core issues, compelled me to reconsider my legal representation.
Consequently, I decided to terminate my attorney's services and embarked on drafting this
motion myself, aiming to bring the court's attention back to the pivotal elements of the case
that had thus far been neglected while able to legally reside in my home.

CONCLUSION AND PRAYER

In conclusion, this motion has laid bare the stark realities and procedural aberrations that have
marred the essence of justice and due process in the matter of Cause No. 322-744263-23.
Through the course of these proceedings, it has become abundantly clear that the actions taken
by the Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, have not only disregarded the welfare and best
interests of our children but have also illuminated her unfitness as a parent. Her actions speak
to a pattern of deceit, manipulation, and an unsettling willingness to leverage the judicial
system for personal vendettas, all at the expense of the emotional and psychological well-being
of our children.

The court, in its decisions, inadvertently facilitated this troubling trajectory by removing me,
Charles Dustin Myers, from the lives of our children based on unsubstantiated claims and
without due consideration of my role as a devoted and stable parent. This oversight has not
only disrupted the lives of our children but has also significantly impaired my ability to provide
for them, casting a long shadow over their future stability and welfare.

Moreover, the conduct of my Counsel involved has further compounded these issues,
demonstrating a distressing disregard for the intricate dynamics and facts of this case. This has
culminated in a situation where the paramount importance of the children's best interests and
the fundamental principles of fairness and justice have been overshadowed by procedural
missteps and a lack of thorough investigation into the Petitioner's fitness as a parent.

Therefore, it is with a heavy hearted yet unwavering resolve that I implore the Court to take 
immediate and decisive action to rectify these wrongs. Specifically, I respectfully request the 
Court to: 
1. Vacate the existing temporary orders that unjustly removed me from my home and 
separated me from my children, restoring the status quo ante until a thorough and 
unbiased evaluation of the facts can be conducted, as the Texas Constitution requires. If 
left as it stands, these orders will further compound the issues at hand, and will 
exacerbate the chaos introduced into the children’s lives. 
2. Set a fair hearing date to delve into the substantive issues at hand, ensuring that all 
parties are given an equitable opportunity to present their case and that the best 
interests of our children are placed at the forefront of all considerations. 
3. Scrutinize any response or new claims from the Petitioner or her counsel with the utmost 
diligence, given the established pattern of deceitful and manipulative behavior exhibited 
by the Petitioner throughout these proceedings. 
4. Consider awarding me full custody of our children, ensuring their continued access to a 
stable, nurturing environment, and the consistent provision of their needs, which I am 
fully committed to upholding. Furthermore, in alignment with my enduring belief in the 
importance of both parents in the lives of our children, I pledge to facilitate and 
encourage a healthy, constructive relationship between the children and their mother, 
provided she demonstrates a genuine commitment to their well-being and stability. 
5. In seeking these remedies, I do so not out of vindictiveness but from a place of deep 
concern for the welfare of our children and a steadfast belief in the principles of justice 
and fairness. Despite the pain and turmoil of these proceedings, my ultimate desire is for 
peace and the best possible outcome for all parties involved, most importantly, our 
children. It is my sincere hope that the Court will recognize the gravity of the situation 
and act in a manner that prioritizes the well-being of our children, ensuring their return 
to a life marked by stability and love. 
 
I affirm under penalty of perjury that all claims herein are true and accurate to the best of my 
knowledge.

THAT WOULD BE AWARDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CHILD SUPPORT
GUIDELINES.

Warnings to Parties

WARNINGS TO PARTIES: FAILURE TO OBEY A COURT ORDER FOR CHILD
SUPPORT OR FOR POSSESSION OF OR ACCESS TO A CHILD MAY RESULT IN
FURTHER LITIGATION TO ENFORCE THE ORDER, INCLUDING CONTEMPT OF
COURT. A FINDING OF CONTEMPT MAY BE PUNISHED BY CONFINEMENT IN JAIL
FOR UP TO SIX MONTHS, A FINE OF UP TO $500 FOR EACH VIOLATION, AND A
MONEY JUDGMENT FOR PAYMENT OF ATTORNEY'S FEES AND COURT COSTS.

FAILURE OF A PARTY TO MAKE A CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENT TO THE
PLACE AND IN THE MANNER REQUIRED BY A COURT ORDER MAY RESULT IN THE
PARTY'S NOT RECEIVING CREDIT FOR MAKING THE PAYMENT.

FAILURE OF A PARTY TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT DOES NOT JUSTIFY
DENYING THAT PARTY COURT-ORDERED POSSESSION OF OR ACCESS TO A
CHILD. REFUSAL BY A PARTY TO ALLOW POSSESSION OF OR ACCESS TO A
CHILD DOES NOT JUSTIFY FAILURE TO PAY COURT-ORDERED CHILD SUPPORT TO
THAT PARTY.

Property and Parties

The Court finds that the following orders respecting the property and parties are
necessary and equitable.

IT IS ORDERED that MORGAN MYERS shall be responsible for the timely payment of

the following:
