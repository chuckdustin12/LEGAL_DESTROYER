Subject: RE: Today's hearing at 11 CL-12105
Dear Ms. Baker, and Mr. Carter,
I am writing to respectfully request a rescheduling of today’s recusal hearing due to an unexpected medical issue. Late
last night, I began experiencing severe tooth pain, which has now escalated to significant facial swelling and intense
discomfort. The pain is currently affecting my ability to speak, eat, and focus, making it challenging to fully participate in
today’s proceedings.
Specifically, it's my bottom left molar which the nerve is open and exposed causing significant pain. 
I want to sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, especially given the efforts the court has made to
accommodate this hearing. Please know that this request is made only out of necessity, and I deeply regret the timing as
I would prefer to move the case forward.
This request comes with a high degree of reluctance given the unexpected technical difficulties experienced last time and
would not be making it if it wasn't absolutely necessary.
Thank you all for your understanding and consideration. I am committed to continuing with the hearing at the earliest
possible opportunity as I am eager to move the case forward.
I wanted to inform the court as soon as possible out of respect for the courts busy schedule.
I currently am unable to locate the case on research texas, as I've been trying to file a formal notice but given the time I
wanted to ensure the court was made aware as soon as possible of the situation.
Lines of communication are open for further discussion or if any further information is needed.
With respect,
Charles Myers
