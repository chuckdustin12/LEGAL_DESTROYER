To: Morgan Wilson <morganmw02(@gmail.com>

Morgan,

As soon as I get receipt that the Clerk's office accepted the SAPCR suit, I will be contacting
law enforcement in Watauga to inform them that I'm seeking to gain access to my home, and
will first contact you before trying to gain entrance.

This is my notice to you. I don't want any trouble.. I don't care about Caitlin, I don't care
about the state of the house or what's been destroyed that's mine - all I care about is being
with the girls.. and upon receipt I have every legal right to do so.

I don't want anyone there to ruin this moment for the girls. Papaw and Meme need to stay
out of it. If they want to get involved - they will need to go through the courts and do things
the right way.

Because as of today, 03/19/2025, you are still my wife, we are still legally married and live
at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148, where you claimed we both own the
matrimonial home.

I will give you a day to prepare if I hear back from you, and will be coming home first thing
Friday morning.

I didn't petition for sole use. Only to decide where the kids live. Let's just do this right so we
can get divorced.

Its been a long year for me.

Hoping you contact me so we can arrange this. You can call me at 817-546-3693 any time.

=== PAGE 2 ===

I know the girls will be extremely happy.

This was the most peaceful way I could find to do this.

But I have a right to be there, and I will be exercising that right as soon as I can.
I'll let you know when I'm on my way.

What a waste of 13 months.

Either way - my return is in the best interests of our children and I hope your
shenanigans are over and we can start working towards this like adults.

Charlie

< Back Morgan,

Mara and Caroline are going to be estatic, and |
don't want to ruin this for them.

| did not request sole use of the house, and just
reiterated | want to do this the right way.

| don't care about anything but those girls, and
this is my notice to you that | will be returning
home, to my house, our matrimonial home,
where we built the lives of our children,
tomorrow .. to give you time to prepare.

lf anyone has a problem with it - they need to
keep it to themselves and go through the
courts.

As meme found out the hard way, you can't just
evict one member of a family.

| haven't requested any kind of protective order
or restraining order.

There's significant damage that has occurred
and my first priority is regaining my stability so |
can be there for the kids.

| haven't slept on a bed in 6 months.

I'll keep my distance, if you choose to stay.
That's your call. But I'm coming back so | can
prepare to move elsewhere.. the right way.. as
should've been done all along.

€ Back Morgan,
Morgan,
Its me. Charlie. Your husband.

Not sure the extent of communications you've
been getting, but I'm reaching out to let you
know that | am coming home.

I've filed a SAPCR and the 233rd District Court
Assumed jurisdiction because there are no valid
court orders in the 322nd case.

The court loses continuous jurisdiction over the
children when no valid orders exist, and the
clerk, after | argued, took the case.

You no longer have sole use of the residence.
You no longer have primary joint conservator.

You will be served with the new case sometime
next week .

Case number is 233-765358-25.

| want to be clear: | want no trouble. | do NOT
want to have to get law enforcement involved
but they are standing by if needed. Hopefully
we Can all be adults and understand the
magnitude of the situation.

Mara and Caroline are going to be estatic, and |
don't want to ruin this for them.

1. “Per Curiam (for M.E.M. and C.R.M.)” by Charles Myers, Father of Record I filed a dragon
in triplicate. Stamped it with a notary seal made of toast. The clerk blinked Morse code at
me, each dot a denial, each dash a delay. I whispered back: "Due process, maybe...?" She
shrugged. Per curiam. I wore a tie made of subpoenas, each one ignored like a bedtime story
read to no one. Shoes made of unserved motions, my footsteps echoing through halls where
justice used to live. I approached the bench riding a unicycle of hearsay. The judge levitated,
the record evaporated, and Morgan's counsel dissolved into a fog of alleged representation. I
asked, “Do you even have authority?” The fog replied: Per curiam. The bailiff offered me a
lemon — bright yellow, bitter as the day they took my children without a hearing. I
objected. He smiled like he’d heard that line before. I hit him with the door on my way out.
Per curiam. I cried out, "But I never agreed!" The courtroom answered in silence. The
Temporary Orders danced across the floor, signed in invisible ink. They spoke in tongues:
"As evidenced by the signatures below..." There were none. But the judge still nodded. Per
curiam. M.E.M. drew a picture of our house. Said: “Daddy, when are you coming home?”
C.R.M. left his shoes by the door — still waiting. I filed my heart as Exhibit A. They struck
it. Hearsay. I tried again. Filed their laughter, their drawings, their birthdays I missed. The
clerk stapled it to a stack of motions never read. Per curiam. Somewhere, a gavel bangs. But
not for me. Not for them. Just another ghost echo in a court that doesn’t listen, doesn’t look,
doesn’t feel. But still I file. Still I write. Still I fight. For them. Per curiam.

You'll be served a copy tomorrow. The issue is the bias against pro-se. They think the case is
improperly before it but don't understand the nuance behind what happened in 322.

Now, they finally realize what's going on because I had to lay it all out.

I'm not out to get you or anyone. I'm after my rights and the kids well being. Which were
violated and disregarded.

Its my duty as their dad. If I hadn't done this you would've been able to successfully erase
me from their lives.

Hope you can understand some day what I had to go through in order to stand up for myself

§
MORGAN MYERS §
AND §  322ND JUDICIAL DISTRICT
CHARLES MEYERS §

§
AND IN THE INTEREST OF §
MARA MYERS AND CAROLINE  § —TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS
MYERS, CHILDREN

PETITIONER'S SUPPORTING AFFIDAVIT

MORGAN MYERS appeared in person before me today and stated under oath:

"My name is MORGAN MYERS. | am above the age of eighteen years, and I am fully
competent to make this affidavit. The facts stated in this affidavit are within my personal
knowledge and are true and correct.

I am the Petitioner in this case.

| have been harassed by Mr Myers in the form of nearly daily emails, text messages, and
voice messages for well over a year. Despite me requesting and demanding that he stop contacting
me regarding anything that isn’t directly about the children, it has continued. He also refuses to
use AppClose, which is required in our temporary orders. | have demanded he stop reaching out
to me outside of the app. This was also ignored. He has reached out to my family because I do not
respond to him. Also concerning family, he has attempted to sue my step-father, Dan Brathoover,
multiple times, and went as far as finding and sending things to his work email address despite
already having his personal email address. He also makes claims that he is going to force several
family members and friends to appear in court for questioning. There are several videos on his

YouTube channel (Charlie’s Vids) where he has discussed our divorce case without my consent,

=== PAGE 22 ===
--- OCR TEXT ---
and included screen recordings of him scrolling through filings he has made that contain my
personal information. In December 2023, Mr Myers gave my phone number to someone online
that I did not know and without my consent so they could message me, trying to convince me to
not go through with filing for divorce. He regularly threatens to show up at my house and that he
“will be moving back in whether [I] like it or not”, claiming we will “cohabitate”. He has stated
multiple times that he will keep me tied up in court and keep the divorce process going for the next
10+ years if we don’t start over and do things his way.

A drug test is necessary for many reasons. Firstly, | have witnessed him smoking marijuana
daily for the entirety of our relationship. | also discovered his use of crystal methamphetamine
around 2019/2020 when I found a small baggie of it in the master bathroom drawer. At that point,
I learned he had been using since the age of 17 years old. Since filing for divorce and living
separately, | found multiple baggies with remains of methamphetamine while cleaning out closets
and drawers. A post on a drug forum was also discovered that he submitted in 2017. It outlined his
use of the drug and glorified it for getting him to where he was in his life at the time. Currently, I
believe he is still actively using, and this regular drug use is causing irrational behaviors such as
drastic mood swings, paranoia, and delusions, which can be tracked in the tones of his messages
to me,

His current behaviors and claims make me concerned for his mental well-being and state
of mind. A psychological evaluation would be highly beneficial not just for his sake, but for the
sake of our children. He has made it clear that he fully believes the following: the two of us living
together again would be best for the girls’ well-being, he requires residence in my home in order
to properly perform his work and earn money, and that he has a claim to the rental house I live in

that is owned by my grandparents, which he hasn’t lived in for over a year. During the last year,

=== PAGE 23 ===
--- OCR TEXT ---
he has refused to find his own place to live, or look for a more stable source of income. There’s
no justifiable reason for this. Instead, he has watched his income dwindle down to the point where
he only brought in $18,000 last year, according to a voice message he sent me recently. On top of
that, he refuses to take any accountability or responsibility for his financial decline. He believes it
is solely my doing.

When it comes to the girls, Mara and Caroline, he is a danger. He poses risks to their
medical and emotional health, as well as their education. It was a regular point of arguments during
our relationship that he would smoke marijuana on the back porch in view of the girls. He would
also leave piles of it all over the kitchen counters where they could easily reach and get into it.
Referring back to where | first discovered the methamphetamine, he would leave it in a drawer in
the master bathroom that was at eye-level for the girls. It was not sealed away in any manner. He
actively participates in parental alienation. He will tell the girls details about our divorce
proceedings that they are too young to fully comprehend. He also tells them, in person and via
Roblox messages, that | am the reason they can’t see or speak to him. Because he is living with a
former coworker who has a son of his own, the girls do not have their own private space when
they are with him. There is no designated bedroom(s) for them. Mara and Caroline have stated on
multiple different occasions throughout the past year that Mr. Myers would leave them home alone
while he made a quick trip to the gas station. They are only 8 and 6 years old. He has also proven
that he has no true respect or regard for their education, Despite being given ample information
and notice ahead of time, he did not help Mara with an important school project during his
Christmas break visitation. | helped her start and complete it when she returned home. There have
been multiple instances where he simply doesn’t take them to school. This usually occurs on a

Friday or Monday during his visitation weekends. There’s never an excuse note turned in to the

=== PAGE 24 ===
--- OCR TEXT ---
school, and they are at risk of truancy at this point due to the accumulated unexcused absences.
Within the last couple of months, there have been many times that he did not show up to pick the
girls up from school on days that are his responsibility, and did not properly communicate this to
me ahead of time. I’ve continuously made arrangements to ensure the girls make it home after
school without having to sit and wait for someone to get them. The most immediate concern
outside of the previously mentioned dangers is his admittal that he will no longer be following the
temporary orders put in place in February 2024. He has claimed that he refuses to pick up the girls
any longer, but has since changed his mind. He now says he will be picking them up from school
every day that I’m at work, which is every weekday. He claims he will pick them up, hang out
with them, then come home for the evening. He also says that he will take them to either his
mother’s or father’s on the weekends. This scares me, because I don’t know what he is capable of
anymore. He has proven that his mind changes constantly, with no warning. I am extremely
worried that he is a flight risk and will take the girls for an extended period of time, or will attempt
to keep them away from me completely with no communication about where they are or their well
being.

] want nothing more than safety and stability for my children and myself. I strongly believe
that due to Mr Myers’s current state of mind, behaviors, and harmful beliefs are a direct threat and
danger to that safety and stability. | believe the best way to avoid that danger is to stop the
harassment by whatever means deemed necessary, a hair follicle/nail clipping drug screening, a

psychological evaluation, and an emergency reconsideration of the custody arrangements.”

Caroline wants to go to a bday party, but since you won't communicate but are clearly
reading the messages- don't know who to call or the details.

Also.. just because the court didn't hear the TRO today doesn't mean anything. Doesn't
change my arguments. They're legally correct.

Especially doesn't change what you've done and the monetary damages you're responsible
for.

Until there's a valid legal reason proving otherwise, you'll be running from accountability.
Just gotta strategize better on my end.

Cooper can't argue against me so she has to resort to insider favors to prevent relief.

To: Morgan Myers <morganmw02(@gmail.com>

Morgan,

If you don't fire your attorney I'm not going to be able to protect you from the consequences
when the truth is finally revealed.

She's only looking out for herself. She interrupted my hearing on Friday by lying to the
judge claiming she would be filing a consolidation motion with the 322nd.

I've put her in a procedural death trap by utilizing rule 12 and 237a, I told you this months
ago.

She can't reinstate jurisdiction because she let the case get removed prior to showing her
authority.

So now - she can't file the notice of Remand because she would be acting ultra vires.
She can't prove her authority because the court doesn't have jurisdiction to hear anything

until the case is remanded.

She's stuck, and is utilizing my self represented status as a means to try and put me in the
category that would apply 99.9999% of the time.

Unfortunately for her, she underestimated me and didn't take me up on my offers to show
mercy despite her bad faith litigation tactics.

You need to start using your brain and understand the consequences of all of this once you
are finally exposed.. which you will be as I've been saying all along.

I can only protect you up to a certain point, but when it all comes out.. I may not be able to
given the circumstances.

You know what you've done is wrong, know it's bad for the kids, and unless you admit it
now and fire your attorney on the record, you have been left without a defense and will be
viewed as a willing participant.

Damages grow each day and I'll be requesting spousal maintenance at our 10 year
anniversary mark due to it.

Ill keep offering you an out at every step, because in the end it's best for the kids.
Just a reminder.

Bringing the kids back today around 7pm.

Please have the girls' stuff ready tomorrow at 3 P.M. They don't need much - just their

Also, just curious...

You seriously gonna just be silent until you're busted? I don't get the mentality. You're
smarter than this.

Dunno who is in your ear, but whoever it is is pretty stupid.
It's just sad to see you like this.

Either so terrified of what you've done or so entitled that you think what you've done is OK
and/or you're invincible.

If I can't have stable services by June, I'll miss the huge deal that I told you about earlier this
year.

This situation looks stupid now, but imagine if it goes until then, and you cost me this
opportunity because you refuse to accept the fact that I can't just up and move because you
want to be with someone else.

Again, this isn't just going to go away. The longer it takes, the worse it looks for you.

I'm gonna be opening up a federal case against you and Cooper on Friday, already got leave
to file the petition - just have to wait to see if Cooper follows through on her promise.

None of what I've said is BS. I've told you everything I would be doing / attempting.

Aside from removing their father from their lives in an abrupt and dishonest fashion,

You've successfully prevented me from re-launching my services since I paused advertising
in 2022, which would have changed the girls' lives for the better, mine, and even yours.

You see - this is the problem with you. You never took the time to even ask me what I was
working on, what I even did to take care of you and the girls, and what my future
plans would be.

Despite telling you as best as I could, you never seemed interested.

Well, let me clarify what I've been doing for the last four years, Mrs. Wilson:

Aside from their father,
you’ve successfully prevented me from re-launching my services since I paused advertising
in 2022.

You see — this is the problem with you. You never once took the time to ask me what I was
building, what I had been working on for years, or what exactly I was doing to provide for
you and the girls — both in the present and for our future.

Despite explaining it to you in the clearest terms I could, you never showed interest. You
dismissed the work as if it were some hobby, when in reality it was an operation poised for
explosive growth — the very growth that could have secured a future for all of us.

Well, let me clarify exactly what I’ve been doing for the last four years, Mrs. Wilson:

From early 2021 through mid-2023, I built a scalable market-data platform from the ground

=== PAGE 49 ===

created an ‘infrastructure designed to handle surging demand. In March 2022, “when business
exploded faster than my systems could handle, I made the calculated choice to pause
advertising — not because demand was gone, but because I needed to strengthen the
foundation so it could sustain that growth.

By January 2024, that foundation was ready. My systems were rebuilt, my product was
market-ready, and the relaunch was set to capture a much larger audience than before. That
was when you blindsided me with a sudden divorce filing in December 2023, coupled with
false statements that removed me from my home, my workspace, and my livelihood.

The result? You didn’t just interrupt a job — you froze a growth trajectory. You didn’t just
stop income — you cut off the very momentum I had built for years. And from January
2024 to today, that disruption has caused an estimated $118,000+ in lost revenue, with
damages still growing every single month.

Now - with no reliable internet connection available to meet the latency demands - I am
unable to scale, and won't ever be able to until I am able to have the infrastructure you
ripped out from underneath me.

You lied about me, made the issues you claim to be the reasons behind our "divorce" about
you being a victim, when you knew damn well and we had discussed it and there was a plan
moving forward.

You did all of this because you're a liar, a cheater, and a horrible friend. Anyone who would
willingly insert themselves into the life of a family with two young children is a scumbag,
and that's what you're now with.

This is what the Federal suit is about. It's about the major damage you've caused to not only
my future, but the girls' and your own as well. You traded the rest of your life for a short-
term splurge that has done nothing positive for anyone other than you, and your lousy
boyfriend.

You traded someone who cared about your children deeply for someone who was willing to
disrupt their life for his own benefit.

You two are the most selfish human beings on the planet, and you both - and Dan - will be
held accountable.

I've attached the evidence that you think doesn't matter.

The reality of the damage you've caused grows each day, and whether you like it or not,
you're going to have to grow up and deal with it before we can get divorced.

The question is: how much more of our children's lives will you sacrifice for Damen?

The scary part - is I believe you would sacrifice all of it.

In March of 2022, FUDSTOP exploded, and I wasn't ready. I didn't have the infrastructure
and didn't know enough about database management to effectively scale the business.

So what did I do? I made the risky decision to stop advertising, and do what's known as the

"Dunning Kruger Effect" by putting in the time to LEARN what it was I was doing, and
what I needed to do to ensure success was reached in the future.

That effort took place between July of 2022 and December of 2023 with the plans to re-

The above image is my current database system running on POSTGRES SQL. I'm running
at about 10%, and am fetching 3.2million tuples of data, and returning nearly 1 billion rows
of data that's disseminated into data feeds.

The problem? Latency. It eats up all of the bandwidth of the internet everywhere I go, and
unless the router is configured properly and unless I have a reliable, direct-connected fiber-
optic connection - latency can NEVER be good enough, resulting in subpar services.

This is EXACTLY what I'm arguing in court, yet you pretend I'm making all of this up.
You accuse me of using "GPT" to do my pleadings as if I haven't spent hundreds of hours
watching college lectures, listening to seminars, watching podcasts, listening to live court
cases on zoom.. nope. You just discount everything about who I am, and get lost in the

process.

Your motive is to escape accountability. Mine is to get back what was stolen from me and
rebuild the life our children once had before you turned into the person you are today.

The damages are not a divorce issue. The divorce issue is YOUR issue, because you can't
finalize it due to your dishonesty that followed you into the Texas judiciary.

So why am I sending you this?

Because it's the truth. Your new job and your boyfriend's assistant manager position doesn't
replace your children's father.

What I'm building will be worth millions one day, and the longer you keep this crap up, the
longer you're withholding a better life from our children.

So rather than re-launching my services, I got rug-pulled. Instead of learning what I love to
do, I was forced to learn the law.

And look what happened.. nothing.
The entire experience is exactly what I'm in business to combat - FUD.

It's a travesty, and you're responsible for this and have had the ability this entire time to do
the right thing - yet you continuously choose not to.

I've never done anything to warrant what you've done, which is why you avoid discussing it
at all costs and surround yourself in an environment where it's safe to behave this way, just
as you've done your entire life.

You have your boyfriend threaten me, tell me I'd be better off dead, when all that means is

exactly what I mentioned above - he's only in this for himself - just like you.

You can't sit there and pretend like the issues you're claiming are the reason for the divorce
just suddenly appeared. That's complete dishonesty. You made a mistake, and instead of
choosing your family, you chose Damen, which I called out from the beginning.

And we're all now living the results from this decision.

Stop wasting all of our time, and either finish this or do the right thing.

When you're shown all of the opportunities I missed because of the circumstances, maybe
then you'll realize what you've done here.

Your family is the way it is because you've always lacked one thing: tough love.
If your feelings are hurt, get over it. You've destroyed lives.
It's time to own up to your mistakes as I have done with mine.

Once you see the full scale of the effort I've put in, what the potential was, and what's
already been taken - maybe then you'll finally wake up.

These debts were incurred as a direct result of being abruptly removed from the home,

which led to a significant increase in cost of living in order to remain near the children for as

long as possible.

Supporting Exhibits :

e Deficiency letter for CX-5 (Exhibit A)

¢ Business affidavits from clients (regarding business disruption) (Exhibit B)

e Personal property inside the CX-5 at the time of repossession was not returned and is

considered lost.

Ill. REAL PROPERTY INTERESTS

Matrimonial Residence

While the debtor does not hold title to the matrimonial residence (property is owned by a

third party), the debtor asserts potential legal rights under the Texas Family Code , including:

¢ Right of possession: The right to occupy the matrimonial home during the pendency of

divorce proceedings absent a valid court order.

e Right of control: The right to reasonable use of the property for business and child care

purposes.

e Right of enjoyment: The right to peaceful enjoyment without interference.

e Right of exclusion: Limited rights regarding access by third parties.

e Right of disposition: Potential community property interest subject to division in divorce

proceedings, as Respondent needs time to transition.

Current Status:

Debtor reports being prevented from accessing the matrimonial residence, which has

=== PAGE 66 ===
--- OCR TEXT ---
directly impacted both personal property and business operations. The current orders causing this

loss of access and property were obtained fraudulently (as alleged). A fair amount of time back in

the residence would serve the children’s best interests as it would prevent the total business

failure.

IV. PERSONAL PROPERTY

Other Personal Property

Note:

Debtor states that all other personal belongings, including clothing and other items, were
disposed of illegally by the Petitioner. Debtor has been prevented from accessing the home to
determine what personal property, if any, remains. Personal property inside the repossessed CX-5
was also lost and not returned. As a result, a complete inventory of personal property is not

possible at this time.
V. BUSINESS ASSETS AND VALUATION
Business Overview

Debtor operates a home-based business providing real-time market data systems for stock

revenue primarily through subscriber fees collected via Patreon and relies on a specific and

robust internet setup as well as bandwidth to provide the services to scale.
Current Business Status (as of October 2025)
e Active Members: 124 (29 paid, 95 free)
e Historical Members: 624 new members (519 paid, 105 free)
e Cancelled Members: 360 (352 paid, 8 free)
Current Membership Tiers
e MEMBER PORTFOLIOS w/ PRICE ALERTS: $40/month (29 members)

e THE FUDSTOP LIFETIME MEMBERSHIP: $650/month (10 members)

¢ Member Portfolio + Webhook Integration: $60/month (5 members)

Pre-Disruption Financial Performance (Patreon Data)

Period Monthly Recurring Revenue (Peak) Annual Revenue

2022 $14,342.52 (August 2022) $100,991.73

2023 $5,098.11 (January 2023) $45,267.74

2024 $2,873.59 (January 2024) $22,277.17

2025 $1,390.57 (February 2025) $12,275.12 (annualized)

Business Valuation Analysis

Given the business’s established recurring revenue, high growth trajectory, and SaaS/tech
platform scalability, industry-standard valuation multiples for scalable tech businesses are 6x—
10x annual recurring revenue. The business was fully prepared to scale, with all technical and
subscriber infrastructure in place, and the forced removal from the home occurred at the critical

moment of scaling, resulting in a catastrophic loss of value and opportunity.

Valuation Period Annual Revenue Multiplier (Range) Business Value (Range)
2022 (Peak Year) $100,991.73 6x — 10x $605,950 — $1,009,917
2025 (Current) $12,275.12 6x — 10x $73,651 — $122,751

=== PAGE 69 ===
--- OCR TEXT ---
Business Valuation Impact:
The forced displacement and inability to access the home-based business infrastructure

caused a catastrophic decline in business value, representing a loss of approximately $532,299 —

$887,166.
Critical Business Assets
e Subscriber base and relationships
e Custom-built data analytics systems
e Website infrastructure and intellectual property
e Real-time data analysis algorithms
e Reputation and market positioning in the financial services niche

e Discord bots (currently in ~75 servers; potential revenue stream that cannot be utilized or

monetized due to lack of access)

e Mobile application (F.U.D.STOP on Android; cannot scale or monetize due to lack of

infrastructure)
Impact Statement

The business operations have been severely disrupted due to lack of access to the
specialized internet connection and technical setup at the home address. This disruption occurred
precisely as the business was ready to scale as a SaaS/tech platform, resulting in the loss of the
ability to serve clients, monetize new features (including Discord bots and mobile applications),
and realize the full market value of the business. The nature of the business requires ultra-low

latency connections to process approximately 60 billion data points per minute, and any service

8

=== PAGE 70 ===
--- OCR TEXT ---
interruption causes critical business failure. The forced removal, with no time to transition or

migrate systems, directly prevented the business from achieving its growth and revenue

potential.

VI. INCOME SOURCES
e Self-employment through client-based services

e YouTube content creation

e Patreon subscription revenue (significantly reduced)
