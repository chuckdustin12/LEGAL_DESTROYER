NARRATIVE SUMMARY 
In the heart of Tarrant County, Texas, a profound breakdown of 
justice has unfolded in the case of 322-744263-23. This case presents not 
merely procedural irregularities, but a systematic dismantling of due 
process that has left a father separated from his home and fighting to 
preserve his parental rights against a backdrop of judicial inaction and 
procedural violations. Underneath it all remains the Real Party in 
Interest, who has had fifteen months to produce a defense against the 
claims made against her, and the record now speaks for itself.  
The record reveals a troubling sequence that began in December 2023, 
when Morgan Michelle Myers initiated divorce proceedings under 
questionable pretenses, falsely claiming an active protective order existed 
to circumvent statutory waiting periods. Despite failing to secure an ex-
parte protective order on December 14, 2023, she withdrew all marital 
funds ($1,576) the following day and relocated to Oklahoma, before 
returning to file for divorce. These actions set in motion a cascade of 
judicial missteps that would follow.

On January 16, 2024, without proper notice or opportunity for a full 
hearing, and without the required findings mandated by Tex. Fam. 
Code 85.001, Mr. Myers was ordered to vacate his family residence by 
2:30 PM that same day—giving him mere hours to leave his home. This 
"kick-out" order came without the procedural safeguards mandated by 
the Texas Family Code, marking the first in a series of due process 
violations that would characterize this case. 
What distinguishes Mr. Myers' response to these events is his 
evolution as a pro se litigant and his unwavering vigilance in seeking 
relief for his children. Though initially represented by counsel, Mr. 
Myers quickly recognized the inadequacy of his representation and 
took the extraordinary step of educating himself in complex areas of 
family and procedural law. As documented in his fourth mandamus 
petition against Honorable David L. Evans, Mr. Myers has not 
approached this litigation as an opportunity to upset the judiciary or 
challenge its authority.  
Rather, he has consistently and respectfully sought only what any 
citizen deserves: a clear explanation for why his life was upended 
without cause and a fair application of the law. The subsequent 
proceedings reveal a pattern of procedural irregularities that cannot be 
dismissed as mere oversight. A settlement agreement reached on

approving temporary orders. Yet these procedures were summarily 
abandoned. An "Agreed Order to Consolidate" was issued without Mr. 
Myers' knowledge or consent. Most egregiously, on March 14, 2024, 
temporary orders were entered as "agreed" despite Mr. Myers' explicit 
refusal to consent 
—his signature notably absent from the document that falsely claimed 
"all parties agree to the terms of this order." 
Throughout this process, Mr. Myers has demonstrated diligence in 
pursuing every available procedural avenue for relief. His mandamus 
petitions—filed against Honorable Jeff Kaitcer (MANDAMUS-
KAITCER), Honorable Kate Stone (MANDAMUS- STONE), Honorable 
Kenneth E. Newell (MANDAMUS-NEWELL), and now Honorable David 
L. Evans (MANDAMUS-EVANS)—reflect not an attempt to harass the 
judiciary but rather a methodical, principled pursuit of justice through 
proper legal channels. Each petition builds upon his growing legal 
knowledge, demonstrating an increasingly sophisticated understanding 
of procedural and substantive law. 
Perhaps most troubling is what followed: silence. From April 2024 
until March 2025— nearly a full year—the case languished in 
procedural limbo. Opposing counsel failed to prosecute the case. The 
court failed to rule on pending motions, including an emergency motion 
to reconsider evidence and vacate temporary orders. Mr. Myers' request

for findings of fact and conclusions of law went unanswered. His 
motion to compel discovery remained unaddressed. Throughout this 
period, Mr. Myers remained displaced from his home, separated from 
his children's primary  
residence, and deprived of his property—all without resolution or 
remedy. 
The damage inflicted extends beyond procedural violations. Mr. 
Myers has suffered financial harm through the loss of marital funds and 
housing displacement. He has been deprived of access to his personal 
property when illegally locked out of his residence on March 6, 2024. 
His relationship with his children has been disrupted without proper 
consideration of their best interests as required by law. His reputation 
has been damaged by unsubstantiated allegations of family violence. 
And he has been forced to navigate this complex legal landscape pro-
se after terminating counsel who failed to adequately represent his 
interests. 
This case represents more than a series of isolated errors; it reflects a 
systemic failure of the judicial process to protect the fundamental rights 
of a litigant. The Texas courts have long recognized that mandamus 
relief is appropriate when a trial court clearly abuses its discretion and 
the relator has no adequate remedy by appeal. Here, both conditions 
are abundantly satisfied. The trial court's actions—and inactions—have

for findings of fact and conclusions of law went unanswered. His
motion to compel discovery remained unaddressed. Throughout this
period, Mr. Myers remained displaced from his home, separated from
his children's primary

residence, and deprived of his property—all without resolution or
remedy.

The damage inflicted extends beyond procedural violations. Mr.
Myers has suffered financial harm through the loss of marital funds and
housing displacement. He has been deprived of access to his personal
property when illegally locked out of his residence on March 6, 2024.
His relationship with his children has been disrupted without proper
consideration of their best interests as required by law. His reputation
has been damaged by unsubstantiated allegations of family violence.
And he has been forced to navigate this complex legal landscape pro-
se after terminating counsel who failed to adequately represent his
interests.

This case represents more than a series of isolated errors; it reflects a
systemic failure of the judicial process to protect the fundamental rights
of a litigant. The Texas courts have long recognized that mandamus
relief is appropriate when a trial court clearly abuses its discretion and
the relator has no adequate remedy by appeal. Here, both conditions

are abundantly satisfied. The trial court's actions—and inactions—have

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
created a situation where justice has been not merely delayed but 
effectively denied. 
As Mr. Myers submits his fourth mandamus petition, this 
memorandum serves to document the extraordinary circumstances that 
necessitate such extraordinary relief. The record speaks with 
unmistakable clarity: this case represents one of the most egregious 
breakdowns of justice in Texas history, where silence is not strategy 
but the absence of any lawful justification for the court's actions. Mr. 
Myers seeks nothing more than to return to the home from which he 
was improperly removed—a simple request for justice that has been 
repeatedly denied through procedural irregularities, judicial inaction, 
and the systematic erosion of due process protections that form the 
foundation of our legal system. 
Indeed, this situation has been damaging, and it has been 
challenging – however – Mr. Myers remains committed to working 
with the judiciary to find a solution that works in the best interests 
of all parties. He holds the circumstances of this case against no 
named judge herein. He respectfully asks this Court and the 
Respondents below to restore what was unduly taken from him as a 
first step.

As Mr. Myers submits his fourth mandamus petition, this
memorandum serves to document the extraordinary circumstances that
necessitate such extraordinary relief. The record speaks with
unmistakable clarity: this case represents one of the most egregious
breakdowns of justice in Texas history, where silence is not strategy
but the absence of any lawful justification for the court's actions. Mr.
Myers seeks nothing more than to return to the home from which he
was improperly removed—a simple request for justice that has been
repeatedly denied through procedural irregularities, judicial inaction,
and the systematic erosion of due process protections that form the
foundation of our legal system.

Indeed, this situation has been damaging, and it has been
challenging — however — Mr. Myers remains committed to working
with the judiciary to find a solution that works in the best interests
of all parties. He holds the circumstances of this case against no
named judge herein. He respectfully asks this Court and the
Respondents below to restore what was unduly taken from him as a

first step.

CURRENT STATUS 
Father has now prepared his fifth mandamus petition, directed 
against Honorable David L. Evans, seeking relief from what he 
characterizes as "the most egregious breakdown of justice that Texas 
history has ever observed." Throughout this odyssey, Father has 
consistently sought only to return to his home and restore his family 
life—not to challenge judicial authority or upset the judiciary. His 
persistence in seeking explanations for why his life was upended 
without cause reflects not obstinance but rather a principled 
commitment to justice and due process. Despite facing silence from 
both the court and opposing counsel, he continues to pursue relief 
through proper legal channels, demonstrating resilience and an 
unwavering belief in the rule of law.

THEMATIC ANALYSIS

A. DUE PROCESS VIOLATIONS

The record reveals a pattern of due process violations that began
with the January 16, 2024 "kick-out" order, when Father was ordered to
vacate his family residence by 2:30 PM that same day—giving him
mere hours to leave his home without adequate notice or opportunity for

continued through the March 14, 2024 hearing, where temporary orders

were entered as "agreed" despite Father's explicit refusal to consent, as 
evidenced by his missing signature on a document that falsely claimed 
"all parties agree to the terms of this order." [MANDAMUS- 
KAITCER: APP. 1.1, APP 1.38] 
Additionally, an "Agreed Order to Consolidate" was issued on 
February 8, 2024, without Father's signature or knowledge 
[MANDAMUS-KAITCER: APP. 3.2], further demonstrating the court's 
disregard for proper notice and consent requirements. The March 14, 
2024, associate judge's report was written by opposing counsel rather 
than the court, with the judge only adding the phrase "for his business." 
[MANDAMUS-KAITCER: MR. 18.1] 
Throughout these proceedings, Father demonstrated remarkable 
restraint and respect for judicial authority. Rather than defying 
improper orders or engaging in self-help remedies, he consistently 
sought relief through proper legal channels. His response to each due 
process violation was not to challenge the court's authority but to 
educate himself on proper procedure and file appropriate motions 
seeking explanation and relief. As documented in his progression 
from his first mandamus petition (MANDAMUS- 24-0395) to his fourth 
(MANDAMUS-EVANS), Father's understanding of due process 
requirements grew in scope, yet his fundamental request remained 
unchanged: a fair application of established procedural safeguards.

I. Legal Analysis 
The Texas Constitution and the United States Constitution both 
guarantee that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or 
property without due process of law. Tex. Const. art. I, § 19; U.S. 
Const. amend. XIV, § 1. The Supreme Court has long held that due 
process requires, at minimum, notice and an opportunity to be heard 
"at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner." Mullane v. 
Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950). 
In the family law context, the Texas Family Code contains specific 
procedural safeguards designed to protect due process rights. For 
example, Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001 et seq. explicitly requires that 
temporary orders may not be rendered without notice and a hearing 
if the order is for the temporary conservatorship of a child, attorney’s 
fees, or for temporary support of the child. 
The Texas Supreme Court has consistently emphasized the 
importance of procedural due process in family law matters. In In re 
Chambless, 257 S.W.3d 698, 700 (Tex. 2008), the Court held that "due 
process requires notice and an opportunity to be heard at a

parent's rights to his or her child, the court must provide the parent 
with fundamentally fair procedures." 
The court's actions in this case—ordering Father to vacate his 
home with only hours' notice, entering orders as "agreed" without 
his consent, and issuing consolidation orders without his 
knowledge—constitute clear violations of these fundamental due 
process protections. As the Texas Supreme Court emphasized in In re 
Office of Attorney Gen., 422 S.W.3d 623, 630 (Tex. 2013), "we must be 
particularly careful to ensure that the process is fair when a party's 
rights to his children are at stake." 
Father's growing understanding of these legal principles is evident 
in the evolution of his mandamus petitions. His first petition 
(MANDAMUS 24-0395) demonstrated a basic understanding of due 
process requirements, but his pleading was fundamentally defective. 
By his fifth petition (MANDAMUS-EVANS), he had developed a 
sophisticated understanding of constitutional due process protections 
and their application in the family law context. This evolution reflects 
not a desire to challenge judicial authority but rather a commitment 
to understanding and properly invoking the procedural protections 
that form the foundation of our legal system to better understand 
the reasoning behind why his life was suddenly upended by the 
state.

II. Procedural Remedies 
Mandamus Relief 
The due process violations in this case warrant immediate mandamus 
relief. The Texas Supreme Court has recognized that mandamus is 
appropriate when a trial court clearly abuses its discretion and the 
relator has no adequate remedy by appeal. In re Prudential Ins. Co. of 
Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 135-36 (Tex. 2004). Here, the trial court's 
disregard for basic due process requirements constitutes a clear abuse 
of discretion. 
The Texas Supreme Court has specifically held that mandamus is 
appropriate to remedy due process violations in family law cases. In In 
re Tex. Dep't of Family & Protective Servs., 210 S.W.3d 609, 613 (Tex. 
2006), the Court granted mandamus relief where a trial court's actions 
deprived a party of due process in a child custody matter. Similarly, in 
In re Derzapf, 219 S.W.3d 327, 334 (Tex. 2007), the Court held that 
mandamus was appropriate where a trial court's order violated a 
parent's due process rights. 
The standard for mandamus relief in Texas was definitively 
established in Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 839-40 (Tex. 1992), 
where the Texas Supreme Court clarified that a relator must establish 
both that the trial court clearly abused its discretion and that the relator

applied in subsequent cases, including In re Columbia Med. Ctr. of Las 
Colinas, Subsidiary, L.P., 290 S.W.3d 204, 207 (Tex. 2009), where the 
Court emphasized that "the adequacy of an appellate remedy must be 
determined by balancing the benefits of mandamus review against 
the detriments." 
The appropriate remedy would be an order directing the trial 
court to vacate the improperly entered temporary orders and to conduct 
new proceedings that comply with constitutional and statutory due 
process requirements. Given the fundamental nature of the rights at 
stake—including Father's right to his home and access to his children—
this extraordinary relief is justified. 
Father's pursuit of mandamus relief reflects his understanding that 
this extraordinary remedy is reserved for situations where trial courts 
clearly abuse their discretion. His sequential filing of mandamus 
petitions against different judges involved in his case demonstrates 
not an attempt to harass the judiciary but rather a methodical pursuit 
of relief from each instance of judicial error. As his legal knowledge 
evolved, so too did the sophistication of his mandamus arguments, yet 
his fundamental request remained consistent: a fair application of 
established procedural safeguards and a clear explanation for why his 
life was upended without cause.

interest." This presumption can only be overcome through proper 
procedures that afford parents due process and require clear evidence 
that limitations on parental rights are necessary to protect the child's

C. MISREPRESENTATIONS AND FRAUD ON THE COURT 
The record reveals several instances of potential misrepresentation 
to the court: 
1. Mother's divorce petition falsely claimed that an active order of 
protection existed against Father, attempting to waive the 
statutory 60-day waiting period. [MANDAMUS-KAITCER: 
MR. 2.7] 
2. The March 14, 2024, temporary orders falsely claimed "as 
evidenced by the signatures below all parties agree to the terms 
of this order," despite Father's signature being absent from the 
document. [MANDAMUS-KAITCER: APP. 1.1, APP 1.38] 
3. The March 14, 2024, associate judge's report was written by 
opposing counsel rather than the court, raising questions 
about its authenticity and impartiality. [MANDAMUS-
KAITCER: MR. 18.1] 
Father's response to these misrepresentations demonstrates his 
commitment to truthfulness in legal proceedings. His refusal to sign 
orders he did not agree with, despite court pressure, reflects his 
principled stance against participating in misrepresentations to the 
court. Similarly, his detailed documentation of these 
misrepresentations in his mandamus petitions reflects his

commitment to truthfulness in legal proceedings. His refusal to sign
orders he did not agree with, despite court pressure, reflects his
principled stance against participating in misrepresentations to the

fraud may be set aside by bill of review." Burnaman v. Heaton, 240 S.W.2d

to temporary orders. 
The Texas Supreme Court has further emphasized in In re Meador, 968

Father has maintained his commitment to truthfulness while appropriately

Case Dismissal 
   Finally, dismissal of this matter should be considered. Mother clearly 
falsified her affidavit of inability to pay court costs, which pursuant to 
the Texas Practice and Remedies Code, is grounds for dismissal. 
Furthermore, this case has not been prosecuted by the opposing side, 
enabling the trial court to hold a hearing as to why the case should not be 
dismissed, or allowing the Respondent, Mr. Myers, in this instance, to 
file a motion for dismissal for want of prosecution, which has already 
been done in this matter. Rather than adjudicate these issues, the court 
rather chose to move to final trial on the merits in the midst of Mr. 
Myers relentless pursuit for relief, leading to the latest recusal 
proceedings and the fourth concurrent mandamus before this Honorable 
Court.

PROCEDURAL CONSIDERATIONS 
Several procedural considerations warrant attention to maximize 
the likelihood of obtaining the extraordinary relief sought. These 
considerations are grounded in the record and reflect the unique 
procedural posture of this case, as well as Mr. Myers' evolution as a pro se 
litigant. 
The record establishes that mandamus relief is not merely appropriate but 
necessary in this case. The Texas Supreme Court has recognized that 
mandamus is available when a trial court clearly abuses its discretion and the 
relator has no adequate remedy by appeal. In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 
148 S.W.3d 124, 135-36 (Tex. 2004). Both conditions are abundantly 
satisfied here. 
First, the trial court's actions—entering orders without proper consent, 
failing to follow its own procedural directives, and refusing to rule on 
pending motions for nearly a year— constitute clear abuses of discretion that 
cannot be reasonably disputed. These are not close calls or matters of 
judicial discretion; they represent fundamental departures from basic 
procedural requirements. 
The Texas Supreme Court established in Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833,

clear and prejudicial error of law.'" The Court further clarified in In re 
Columbia Med. Ctr. of Las Colinas, Subsidiary, L.P., 290 S.W. 3d 204, 207-
08 (Tex. 2009), that a trial court abuses its discretion when it fails to correctly 
analyze or apply the law. 
Second, Father has no adequate remedy by appeal. The temporary orders 
that removed him from his home and restricted his access to his children 
are not immediately appealable under Texas law. As the Texas Supreme Court 
held in In re Derzapf, 219 S.W. 3d 327, 334-35 (Tex. 2007), "a party does not 
have an adequate remedy by appeal when the trial court's order imposes a 
serious disruption in the parent-child relationship." Moreover, the court's 
prolonged inaction has effectively denied Father any meaningful 
opportunity to challenge these orders through the normal appellate process.  
By the time a final judgment is entered and an appeal becomes available, 
Father will have suffered an unreasonable amount of irreparable harm to 
his relationship with his children, his property rights, and his financial 
stability that should be resolved before final trial is considered. Between the 
unopposed summary judgement filed February 22, 2024, the Rule 12 motion that 
has yet to be resolved, and the unopposed DWOP motion filed, the court below 
refuses to acknowledge any of these methods that would correct this situation. 
Rather, it continues to commit error by ignoring the pressing issues and 
constantly favoring the opposing party who has failed to prosecute their case.

CONSOLIDATION OF RELIEF REQUESTS 
 
Given the filing of multiple mandamus petitions addressing different 
aspects of the same underlying case, consideration should be given to 
requesting consolidated treatment of these petitions. The record 
demonstrates that the various judicial actions at issue—from the 322nd 
Judicial District Court, the 233rd Judicial District Court, and individual 
judges including Honorable David L. Evans, Honorable Kate Stone, 
Honorable Kenneth E. Newell, and Honorable Jeff Kaitcer—are 
interconnected parts of a single pattern of procedural irregularities and 
due process violations. 
Consolidated treatment would allow the reviewing court to see the 
full picture of the challenges faced by Mr. Myers rather than 
addressing each incident in isolation. It would also promote judicial 
economy by avoiding duplicative proceedings and potentially 
inconsistent rulings. 
The Texas Supreme Court has recognized the value of consolidation 
in complex cases. In In re Valero Energy Corp., 968 S.W.2d 916, 916-
17 (Tex. 1998), the Court consolidated multiple mandamus proceedings 
arising from the same underlying case to promote efficiency and 
consistency. The statement of facts filed as Exhibit A in Mr. Myers’ 
Motion to Consolidate in tandem with the latest mandamus paint the full 
procedural history of the matter.

EMERGENCY RELIEF PENDING DISPOSITION 
The consolidated mandamus record in the Motion to Consolidate 
justifies a request for emergency relief pending final disposition of the 
mandamus petition. Father has been removed from his home since January 
16, 2024— over 16 months—based on temporary orders that were 
procedurally defective and later entered without his consent.  
The ongoing harm to his parental rights, property rights, and 
financial stability cannot be remedied by eventual relief; each day 
under these improper orders causes additional irreparable harm. 
Emergency relief could take the form of a stay of the temporary orders 
pending final disposition of the mandamus petition, or an order allowing 
Father to return to his home so that a realistic plan for the children can be 
effectuated that is in line with their best interests. Such relief would prevent 
further harm while still preserving the court's ability to make a final 
determination on the merits. Most importantly, the relief sought by Mr. Myers 
does not infringe upon the rights of any party – it merely restores the rights that 
he was divested of at the onset of this matter.  
The Texas Supreme Court has recognized the appropriateness of emergency 
relief in family law cases where fundamental rights are at stake. In In re Tex. 
Dep't of Family & Protective Servs., 255 S.W.3d 613, 615 (Tex. 2008), the

proceeding. Such circumstance is parallel to the benefits of issuing such 
relief here. 
POTENTIAL FOR FEDERAL RELIEF 
While the current focus is properly on state court remedies through 
mandamus, the record would support federal intervention if state remedies 
prove inadequate. The due process violations documented in this case 
implicate federal constitutional rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. If 
state courts fail to provide timely and effective relief, Father could 
potentially seek relief in federal court through a civil rights action under 42 
U.S.C. § 1983 or other appropriate vehicles. 
This consideration is particularly relevant given the extraordinary length 
of time that has already elapsed without meaningful judicial action. If 
the pattern of delay continues, federal intervention may become not 
merely an option but a necessity to protect Father's constitutional 
rights. The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized in Troxel v. Granville, 530 
U.S. 57, 65-66 (2000), that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth 
Amendment protects the fundamental right of parents to make decisions 
concerning the care, custody, and control of their children. Similarly, in

countervailing interest, protection."

RELIEF SHOULD ISSUE NOW RATHER THAN LATER 
Given the pervasive nature of the procedural defects in this case, 
piecemeal remedies addressing individual orders or actions may be 
insufficient. The record would support a request for comprehensive relief 
that addresses the full range of procedural violations and restores Father 
to the position he would have occupied absent these violations. 
Such relief could include: - Vacating all orders entered without proper 
notice or consent - Directing the trial court to conduct new proceedings 
that comply with all procedural requirements - Ordering the immediate 
return of Father to his home - Requiring expedited consideration of all 
pending motions - Imposing deadlines for future proceedings to 
prevent additional delays – or case dismissal given the fraudulent nature 
that it was initiated, the fundamental errors made at the onset, and the fact 
that the affidavit of inability to pay was falsified in the divorce petition. 
This comprehensive approach would recognize that the breakdown of 
justice in this case is not limited to isolated incidents but represents a 
systemic failure that requires an equally systemic remedy. The Texas 
Supreme Court has recognized the appropriateness of comprehensive relief in 
cases involving pervasive procedural irregularities. In In re E.R., 385 S.W.3d 
552, 566 (Tex. 2012), the Court granted broad relief to address multiple 
procedural violations in a family law case, including vacating improper 
orders and directing the trial court to conduct new proceedings.

that it was initiated, the fundamental errors made at the onset, and the fact
that the affidavit of inability to pay was falsified in the divorce petition.

This comprehensive approach would recognize that the breakdown of
justice in this case is not limited to isolated incidents but represents a
systemic failure that requires an equally systemic remedy. The Texas
Supreme Court has recognized the appropriateness of comprehensive relief in
cases involving pervasive procedural irregularities. In In re E.R., 385 S.W.3d
552, 566 (Tex. 2012), the Court granted broad relief to address multiple
procedural violations in a family law case, including vacating improper

orders and directing the trial court to conduct new proceedings.

MR. MYERS’ INTENT AND APPROACH 
Throughout this procedural odyssey, Mr. Myers has consistently 
demonstrated that his intent is not to upset the judiciary or challenge its 
authority, but simply to seek a lawful explanation for why his life was 
upended without cause. His approach has been characterized by: 
1. Respect for Judicial Authority: Despite facing significant procedural 
irregularities, Mr. Myers has consistently sought relief through 
proper legal channels rather than defying court orders or engaging 
in self-help remedies. 
2. Commitment to Self-Education: When faced with inadequate 
representation, Mr. Myers took the extraordinary step of 
educating himself in complex areas of family and procedural 
law, demonstrating a remarkable evolution from his first 
mandamus petition to his fourth. 
3. Precision in Relief Requests: Rather than making broad 
accusations against the judiciary, Mr. Myers has carefully 
tailored his relief requests to specific judicial actions and 
supported them with detailed factual and legal arguments. 
4. Persistence in Seeking Explanation: Throughout this process, Mr. 
Myers has consistently sought not just relief but explanation—a

MR. MYERS’ INTENT AND APPROACH

Throughout this procedural odyssey, Mr. Myers has consistently
demonstrated that his intent is not to upset the judiciary or challenge its
authority, but simply to seek a lawful explanation for why his life was

upended without cause. His approach has been characterized by:

irregularities, Mr. Myers has consistently sought relief through
proper legal channels rather than defying court orders or engaging

clear articulation of the legal basis for the actions that have so 
dramatically affected his life. 
5. Focus on Restoration Rather Than Punishment: Mr. Myers' relief 
requests have consistently focused on restoring proper procedure 
and returning to his home rather than seeking punitive 
measures against judicial officers. 
This approach demonstrates that Mr. Myers is not a vexatious 
litigant seeking to harass the courts, but rather a citizen earnestly seeking 
the procedural protections and explanations to which he is entitled. His 
evolution as a pro se litigant reflects not an attempt to circumvent proper 
procedure but rather a determined effort to understand and properly 
invoke the procedural protections that form the foundation of our legal 
system. 
The Path Forward: Repair and Restoration 
It is important to emphasize that Mr. Myers holds nothing against 
anyone involved in this case. He recognizes that people make mistakes, 
including judges, attorneys, and litigants. His goal is not to assign blame 
or seek retribution, but to begin the repair process that is so desperately 
needed for his children and family. While the Mother in this case has 
abused the legal process and is fundamentally responsible for the 
irreparable harm, she is the Mother of his children, and her 
consequences will come later from the appropriate legal remedies. The

requested relief—his return to the family home—would benefit all parties 
involved: 
The Children: The children would benefit from stability and the 
restoration of their relationship with their father in their primary 
residence. As the Texas Supreme Court recognized in In re J.F.C., 
96 S.W.3d 256, 304 (Tex. 2002), "maintaining the parent-child 
relationship is of paramount importance to the child's welfare 
and development." Since his removal, the children have been 
cared for by relatives, and significant financial damage 
continues to accrue which dampens their future. 
The Judicial System: Granting the requested relief would restore 
confidence in the judicial process and demonstrate the system's 
capacity for self-correction when errors occur. As the Texas 
Supreme Court noted in In re Columbia Med. Ctr. of Las Colinas, 
Subsidiary, L.P., 290 S.W.3d 204, 211 (Tex. 2009), "the judicial 
system as a whole benefits from transparency, openness, and 
accountability." In this matter, accountability is desperately 
needed, and granting the relief would begin this long overdue 
process.

current state of procedural limbo serves no one's interests, and 
the increasing damages caused by the opposing party won’t 
just go away because of her continued silence. Dealing with

damages from continuing to accrue over time. 
Mr. Myers Himself: Beyond the obvious benefit of returning to his

opportunity to move forward with his life and focus on his 
children rather than litigation and to rebuild what’s left of his 
business which he requires the home to operate, and plan for 
the future in a way that serves his children’s interests. The few 
months in the beginning of this case that Mr. Myers needed to 
effectuate the transfer of his business while also maintaining 
the children’s status quo has been thwarted by the Mother’s 
priority of pursuing her extramarital affair. Such actions 
should not be tolerated by the judiciary, and the record speaks 
loud and clear regarding these claims. After sixteen months of 
litigation, Mother has not raised any defense to these claims, 
nor has her attorney.

the opposing party has failed to prosecute the case for nearly a year, 
suggesting a lack of genuine opposition to Mr. Myers' return to the family 
home. This silence is telling—it indicates not strategy but the absence of 
any lawful justification for the current state of affairs. 
Finally, it is crucial to recognize that permitting Mr. Myers to return 
home would not take away anyone's fundamental rights. To the contrary, 
it would protect rights—Mr. Myers' property rights, his parental rights, 
and most importantly, his children's right to maintain a meaningful 
relationship with their father. As the Texas Supreme Court emphasized in 
In re C.J.C., 603 S.W.3d 804, 808 (Tex. 2020), "the natural right existing

repair the damage that has been done, and to restore Mr. Myers to his 
rightful place in his home and in his children's lives. This is not merely 
what justice demands—it is what benefits everyone involved in this case 
and the judicial system as a whole. 
CONCLUSION 
The record in this case presents a stark and troubling portrait of 
justice denied. Charles Dustin Myers has endured a systematic 
dismantling of his fundamental rights through a series of procedural 
violations, judicial inactions, and misrepresentations that collectively 
constitute one of the most distinct breakdowns of justice in Texas history.

The chronology reveals a clear pattern: beginning with his sudden 
removal from his home on January 16, 2024, with mere hours' notice, 
continuing through delays and multiple associate judge reports that 
were quickly thrown together by father’s last-minute retainment of 
counsel, the entry of "agreed" orders without his consent on March 14, 
2024, and culminating in nearly a year of complete judicial inaction while 
he remained displaced from his home and separated from his children's 
primary residence. At each critical juncture, the court system failed to 
provide the basic procedural protections that form the foundation of due 
process.

the procedural violations but Mr. Myers' extraordinary response to them. 
When faced with inadequate legal representation, he took the remarkable 
step of educating himself in complex areas of family and procedural law.

EVANS)—reflects not an attempt to harass the judiciary but rather a 
methodical, principled pursuit of justice through proper legal channels.
