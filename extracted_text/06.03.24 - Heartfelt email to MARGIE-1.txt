Dear Margie,
I am writing to you out of deep concern for our family, especially Mara and Caroline. Our lives have been drastically
altered since December, and I need to address the ongoing issues that have emerged since then.
Before these unfortunate events, our family life was stable and full of joy. Mara and Caroline were thriving in an
environment where both their parents were actively involved in their upbringing. We worked together to ensure their
happiness, health, and security. Our home was a sanctuary, filled with love and the comforting routines of daily family life.
However, the situation has drastically changed. The actions taken have not only displaced me from my home but also
disrupted the stability and security that Mara and Caroline desperately need. You recently shared with me that Morgan
has not been paying rent and that the girls have not been seeing the doctor or getting the insurance they need. This is
deeply troubling and goes against everything I have been trying to convey in court.
I need to emphasize that if this situation is not resolved by July 1st, I will have no choice but to escalate the matter to
federal court, something I have educated myself on and something I have significant evidence for. This is not a step I wish
to take lightly, as it would further strain our family and prolong the suffering for Mara and Caroline. However, the actions
taken thus far—rushing decisions, evicting me without cause, and disrupting our family life—cannot go unchallenged.
The specific actions you and Dan Branthoover are responsible for, including advising Morgan to withdraw all joint finances
and supporting her decision to remove me from my place of business and home, have directly impacted our family's
stability and were a direct infringement on my constitutional rights . These actions have not only harmed me but have also
affected Mara and Caroline, who rely on the business for their security. Additionally, your decision to hand-deliver an
eviction notice without just cause has exacerbated the situation further.
While I understand you were put in the middle, given what's transpired within the case and how the court chose to handle
it, in order to hold Dan accountable for his role in this required me to exhaust all state remedies before I can cross state
lines and enjoin the rest of the parties in the suit.
I want to make it clear that I am not against the divorce itself. If Morgan wants a divorce, we need to do it the right way.
Continuing down this path is only causing destruction and instability for everyone involved. I will have to enjoin both you
and Dan into the divorce suit for damages if this continues, as the actions taken have significantly impacted my ability to
provide for the children and maintain stability.
We have a choice before us. This situation can be corrected through the impersonal court system, which could drag on
for months or even years, causing further distress and instability for the children. Or, we can come together as a family,
acknowledge the mistakes that have been made, and take immediate steps to rectify them. I am fully committed to
working collaboratively and amicably to restore the stability and happiness of Mara and Caroline’s lives. They deserve
nothing less.
Margie, your support and understanding in this matter could make all the difference. Let's find a way to resolve this within
the family, for the sake of Mara and Caroline, and for the love and respect we all share for each other.
I hope you understand that the exact situation before us is exactly what would have been prevented if I had been able to
transition out of the house with a reasonable amount of time.
Morgan's actions will result in the stability of Mara and Caroline being destroyed. 
The case is currently in the Supreme Court of Texas. Depending on what they decide will determine the next steps
moving forward.

Dear Margie,

| am writing to you out of deep concern for our family, especially Mara and Caroline. Our lives have been drastically
altered since December, and | need to address the ongoing issues that have emerged since then.

Before these unfortunate events, our family life was stable and full of joy. Mara and Caroline were thriving in an
environment where both their parents were actively involved in their upbringing. We worked together to ensure their
happiness, health, and security. Our home was a sanctuary, filled with love and the comforting routines of daily family life.

However, the situation has drastically changed. The actions taken have not only displaced me from my home but also

One thing is for certain: These judges and lawyers care not what happens to us. 
I hope we all make the right choice for their sake.
We can get divorced without ruining everyone's lives in the process - something I've been saying all along.
If the decision is made to take the high road, we can all discuss terms and a path moving forward that benefits us all.
If the decision is made to stay in the courts, the family court system will destroy this family, and has already started to. I
speak from the heart here, and from experience, as the family court system took 10 years from my childhood, and I
refuse to let the same scenario unfold for Mara and Caroline.
Sincerely,
Charles
