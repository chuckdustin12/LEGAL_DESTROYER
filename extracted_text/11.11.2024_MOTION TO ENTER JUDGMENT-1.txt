I. TEXAS PRESCEDENT REGARDING RECUSAL
1. In Texas, courts operate under a foundational presumption of impartiality.
However, this presumption can be overcome if a movant presents compelling evidence of 
bias that fundamentally threatens due process. The Texas Court of Appeals has emphasized 
this requirement: bias must be so severe that it denies the movant a fair and impartial 
hearing. In Interest of E.R.C., 496 S.W.3d 270, 280 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2016, pet. 
denied); Ex parte Ellis, 275 S.W.3d 109, 117 (Tex. App.—Austin 2008, no pet.). Simply 
put, due process mandates that all parties are heard by a neutral, detached judge. Brumit v. 
State, 206 S.W.3d 639, 644-45 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006). This is not just a procedural 
necessity; it’s enshrined in both the U.S. Constitution and the Texas Constitution. 
2. Texas courts use the "reasonable person" test to determine whether recusal is
appropriate: Would a well-informed, impartial observer reasonably question the judge's 
impartiality based on the known facts? Hansen v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., 346 S.W.3d 
769, 776 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2011, no pet.) (quoting Sears v. Olivarez, 28 S.W.3d 611, 615 
(Tex. App.-Corpus Christi 2000, order) (en banc) (internal quotations and citations 
omitted). If the answer is yes, recusal is warranted. In this case, numerous procedural 
missteps and decisions have seriously jeopardized the perception of fairness. Texas 
precedent, therefore, supports a careful review to uphold the judicial integrity required by 
law. 
4. Without evidence admitted in this matter, and without any findings on behalf of
the tribunal,  the court chose to sever the parent-child relationship for one parent due to 
false claims made by another prior to being afforded an opportunity to present his case.

II. ARGUMENT
This case exemplifies a serious violation of core due process principles, particularly 
in the failure of the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County as a whole to substantiate its 
rulings with factual findings or evidentiary support. Such ungrounded decisions have 
resulted in substantial harm, indicating a concerning bias that jeopardizes a fair resolution. 
This bias has disrupted the parent-child relationship by unjustly favoring one parent, 
despite indications that this party has prioritized personal interests over the children’s 
welfare, while penalizing the other without lawful basis. 
Without any factual or legal justification for these decisions, the only reasonable 
inference is an underlying bias, likely fueled by either fraudulent pleadings submitted by 
the Petitioner or an extrajudicial influence not in the record. These circumstances call for 
recusal to restore impartiality and procedural integrity. The judges’ actions contravene their 
duties under the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct, disregarding fundamental protections 
enshrined in both the U.S. Constitution and Texas law. Given these considerations, 
Respondent CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS respectfully requests that the Court grant the 
Joint Motion to Recuse and, in the interest of judicial economy, issue judgment without a 
hearing if the opposing party does not respond by a designated date deemed appropriate by 
the court. The Respondent further seeks pre-admission of uncontested evidence relevant to 
this motion to assist the Court’s determination. 
Given the questionable handling of the case, the original Joint Motion to Recuse has 
been concurrently attached as a separate lead document, fully hyperlinked for convenience.

III. Performing the Duties of Judicial Office Impartially and 
Diligently 
1. There are three prongs present within Canon 3 of the Texas Rules of Judicial 
Conduct. All three prongs, in general, “take precedence over all the judge's other 
activities”, and each set forth standards to be followed in during the performance of such 
duties.1 The issue is whether District Judge James Munford and Associate Judge Jeffrey 
Kaitcer should be recused. The rules and analysis of how they were applied in this case 
can only lead a reasonable fact finder to conclude that their recusal is warranted. 
A. PRONG 1 – ADJUDICATIVE DUTIES 
2. The first prong is the adjudicative standard outlined in Canon 3(B) of the Texas 
Code of Judicial Conduct. Paragraph 2 requires that “[a] judge should be faithful to the 
law and shall maintain professional competence in it,” and specifies that “[a] judge shall 
not be swayed by partisan interests, public clamor, or fear of criticism.” Additionally, 
Paragraph 5 mandates that a judge “perform judicial duties without bias or prejudice,” 
while Paragraph 8 ensures that “[a] judge shall accord to every person who has a legal 
interest in a proceeding, or that person's lawyer, the right to be heard according to law.” 
Further, Paragraph 9 sets the standard that “[a] judge should dispose of all judicial 
matters promptly, efficiently and fairly.” All of these paragraphs are directly relevant and 
can be applied in the determination of recusal.

B. PRONG 2 – ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES
3. Standards for a judge’s administrative responsibilities are outlined under Canon
3(C) of the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct. Paragraph 1 requires that “[a] judge should 
diligently and promptly discharge the judge's administrative responsibilities without bias 
or prejudice, maintain professional competence in judicial administration, and cooperate 
with other judges and court officials in the administration of court business.” 
Additionally, paragraph 2 mandates that a judge must ensure that “staff, court officials, 
and others subject to the judge's direction and control observe the standards of fidelity 
and diligence that apply to the judge and refrain from manifesting bias or prejudice in the 
performance of their official duties.” These standards are critical to the recusal motion 
because they underscore the judge's obligation not only to maintain impartiality in 
personal actions but also to actively prevent bias or prejudice in all court operations under 
their oversight.  
C. PRONG 3 – DISCIPLINARY DUTIES
4. Canon 3(D) of the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct outlines a judge's
disciplinary responsibilities, which directly relate to maintaining the ethical integrity of 
the judicial process. Paragraph 1 requires that if a judge has clear information that 
another judge has violated the Code, they must take appropriate action. When the 
violation raises substantial concerns about the other judge's fitness for office, the judge is 
obligated to inform the State Commission on Judicial Conduct or take other suitable 
measures. Similarly, Paragraph 2 mandates that a judge who learns of a lawyer’s serious

breach of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct—especially one that 
questions the lawyer’s honesty, trustworthiness, or overall fitness—must report the 
violation to the Office of the General Counsel of the State Bar of Texas or take other 
appropriate action. These disciplinary obligations are highly relevant to the recusal 
motion. The standards reinforce a judge’s duty to uphold ethical conduct across all roles 
in the judicial system, ensuring that neither judicial nor legal misconduct goes 
unaddressed. In cases where bias, impropriety, or ethical breaches by a presiding judge 
are evident, the principles in Canon 3(D) underscore the necessity of recusal to protect 
the integrity of the proceedings and maintain the judiciary's credibility in the eyes of the 
public. 
5. Notwithstanding the reasons set forth in the joint motion to recuse, the
additional facts explained below show an intentional effort to deprive the Respondent 
access to justice after he has exhausted all other State remedies, and one needs to look no 
further than how the joint recusal motion was handled to highlight this effort showcasing 
the appearance of impartiality, which warrants recusal. 
D. THE TEXAS RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
6. Pursuant to the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 18(a)(f), the Respondent judges
have two options once a motion to recuse is filed. 1) the judge can file with the clerk an 
order of recusal or disqualification, or 2) the judge can sign and file with the clerk an 
order referring the motion to the regional presiding judge.

7. Rather than filing the orders of referral with the clerk of the court, they were
forwarded from the court coordinator via email, Lindsey Baker, without the required 
certificate of service and remain inaccessible through the Texas Supreme Court approved 
electronic filing manager, re:Search Texas.

vital to the motion. This fact was promptly pointed out in Exhibit 1, where the file size 
difference can be seen from the email attachments. Click for reference. 
9. Lindsey Baker then confirmed that the exhibits and affidavits had been
forwarded. The file size difference was then pointed out in the last correspondence chain 
found within Exhibit 1, to which an amended order of referral followed, and the reasons 
given for the modification of the original motion changed due to the motion’s length, 
thereby justifying the modification of the original motion into three parts. See Exhibit 2. 
Click for reference. 
10. Given that the very purpose of re:Search Texas is to streamline the process of
service and case management, it raises the question as to why the court would choose to 
utilize the platform up until the joint motion to recuse was filed. Further, the Frequently 
Asked Questions found within the District Clerk’s website for electronic filing 
specifically reiterate that exhibits should be merged into one document with the lead 
document, and that the file size limit is 35mb. Given that the Respondent’s original joint 
motion to recuse was well under the maximum size of 35mb, and the joint motion was 
filed as one document as the clerk prefers – why was it modified and served outside of

departure from the standards of impartiality and integrity mandated by Canon 3 of the 
Texas Code of Judicial Conduct. The facts before this court reveal a pattern of procedural 
inconsistencies and biased decision-making that stem, in large part, from the Petitioner’s 
misleading tactics—an influence that both judges have inadvertently allowed to impact 
their rulings. Even though such information may have been obtained during the 
proceedings, that information was kept private and never disclosed or entered into the 
record, leaving an appearance of impartiality without findings, which is enough to warrant 
recusal. See Rogers v. Bradley, 909 S.W.2d 872, 873 (Tex.1995) (“Declaration of 
Recusal” by

was properly served through the EFM as one document, with the affidavit and all exhibits

attached as one motion, but is albeit missing from the electronic case docket.

be impartial is the requirement that judge appear to be impartial so that no doubts or 
suspicions exist as to the fairness or integrity of the court.”; see also Sears v. Olivarez, 28 
S.W.3d 611, 613–14 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 2000, no pet.). The facts outlined above 
raise serious doubts to these requirements. 
14. Under Canon 3(B), judges are required to adjudicate based on impartiality and
factual accuracy. However, the judges’ failure to critically assess the Petitioner’s narrative 
of hardship, coupled with improper handling of filings, has resulted in decisions that lack 
factual support and undermine the Respondent's rights to a fair hearing. This court now 
has the opportunity to address this lapse by recusing the judges and ensuring the case is 
overseen with genuine impartiality. 
15. Canon 3(C) underscores the judges' responsibility to administer the court’s
operations consistently and transparently. The irregular handling of critical filings—
orders forwarded without proper certificates of service, mismanagement within the EFM 
system, and discrepancies in access demonstrate a failure in maintaining the procedural 
integrity essential to a fair process. These administrative oversights have obstructed the 
Respondent’s access to justice, and this court now has both the facts and the authority to 
remedy this.

mixed with permitting a likely unauthorized attorney to prosecute the case and does not

F. A CLOSER LOOK AT CANON 3(D)(2)
17. A judge who receives information clearly establishing that a lawyer has
committed a violation of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct should 
take appropriate action. 
18. To assist in this determination, notwithstanding the current challenge to Ms.
Carter’s authority, one needs to look no further than the current temporary orders in 
place, which is attached as Exhibit I in the original joint motion to recuse filed on 
October 7, 2024. 
19. On page 1, the orders read: “On February 1, 2024, the Court heard Petitioner's
motion for temporary orders.” A review of the record will show that no motion for 
temporary orders has been served to the Respondent in this matter, no notice of hearing 
was served to the parties regarding such a motion, and no hearing ever occurred 
regarding this motion. 
20. The orders move on to state that both parties “appeared by counsel and
announced ready” and “signed an agreed associate judge’s report” when in fact, both 
parties appeared, but were rushed into a settlement agreement by the Respondent’s prior 
counsel due to his unwillingness to remain in the courthouse all day, leading to his 
termination. Steve Myers, a witness, was present in the conference room during this 
exchange. Neither party went before the judge on February 1st, 2024. See Exhibit 6.

21. The agreement, which can be found in Exhibit E in the original joint motion to
recuse, had the following provisions at the bottom of page 5 of the agreement: 
“A typed written Order conforming to this Report will follow within 20 days from 
the date this Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be prepared by Dan Bacalis. 
Each attorney should approve the Order. The parties do not need to approve the Order. 
The attorney reviewing the proposed Order shall have five (5) days to do so. There are no 
ten (10) day letters. If an agreement is not reached, a Motion to Sign shall be filed and set 
within thirty (30) days from the signing of this Report.” 
22. Given that an agreement was clearly not reached, the orders were reduced to
writing well beyond the 20 day requirement, the orders were not prepared by Dan 
Bacalis, no motion to sign was filed, and the Respondent was not given 5 days to review 
the orders, it calls into question as to how they were permitted to be rendered despite 
lacking the Respondent’s signature and despite being served to him immediately prior to 
a hearing scheduled to challenge their legal foundation.  
23. Notwithstanding the above, the mere fact that the orders state “[t]he parties
have agreed to the terms of this order as evidenced by the signatures below.” and no 
signature from the Respondent is present showcases a pre-determined outcome, and a 
one-sided favoritism that warrants recusal. 
24. Finally, and most concerning, is the fact that Judge Jeff Kaitcer affixed his

all necessary prerequisites of the law have been legally satisfied and that the Court has 
jurisdiction of this case and of all the parties.” 
25. The foregoing statement can’t possibly be true for two reasons. 1) No evidence
has been admitted into this case, and no argument from counsel was presented – only  
objections without foundation. 2) The associate judge could not have possibly examined 
the record, because it is apparent that consent was not present at the time of rendition, and 
the directives he ordered within the agreement were not followed.  
26. Expanding on point 2 above, the associate judge could not possibly have
examined the record because in the original answer to the protective order filed by the 
Respondent, he claimed duress as an affirmative defense alongside fraud and illegality. 
See Exhibit 7.  
27. There can be no claim of duress unless the following elements are present: (1)
a threat or action taken without legal justification; (2) the threat or action was of such a 
character as to destroy the other party's free agency; (3) the threat or action overcame the 
opposing party's free will, causing them to do something they would not otherwise have 
done and were not legally bound to do; (4) the restraint was imminent; and (5) the 
opposing party had no present means of protection (McMahan v. Greenwood, 108 S.W.3d

28. The Petitioner’s actions—including seeking an emergency ex parte order,
initiating an eviction, filing for divorce, and pursuing an additional protective order—
occurred within an 8-day span, representing actions taken without legal justification. 
29. These actions threatened the Respondent’s livelihood by removing him from
the residence he needed to provide for his children, as well as from the home where his 
children had been raised with their father. This threat materialized on January 16, 2024, 
when the Respondent was ordered to vacate the residence without justification. 
30. These actions forced the Respondent to sign an agreement he would not have
otherwise accepted. This agreement allowed him to return to the residence but involved 
conditions that removed his children from their home and was under no legal obligation 
to settle given the circumstances of the case and the baselessness of the claims made 
against him. 
31. If the Respondent did not sign, he would have faced no alternative other than
continued exclusion from his residence and further impairment of his ability to provide 
for his children. This threat was imminent. 
32. The Respondent’s counsel advised him to sign the agreement instead of
proceeding to a hearing, leaving him without a viable means of protection at that time.

34. Finally, Ms. Carter signed a pleading containing false statements, in violation

appearance before the court, such as a hearing or trial. Per Tex. R. Civ. P. 21(a), every 
pleading, plea, motion, or application to the court for an order—whether presented as a 
motion, plea, or other request—must be filed with the court clerk in writing, state the 
grounds, and be noted on the docket unless presented during a hearing or trial. 
36. Should this matter proceed to a hearing, the court must adhere to the Texas
Rules of Civil Procedure, including docketing all missing items listed in Exhibit 4 and 
following the service requirements in Rule 21a when scheduling the hearing. Informal 
notices via email only obscure the opportunity for an appeal and fail to comply with 
Texas Civil Procedure. The court cannot continue to overlook its duty to correct these 
oversights, nor can it ignore the law to uphold decisions lacking any legal justification.

37. It is deeply troubling that the Respondent, a self-represented litigant, must 
underscore basic procedural requirements to ensure adherence to standard rules, while the 
Petitioner’s attorney has repeatedly disregarded these processes by raising  objections in 
proceedings yet remains silent in the record. This absence of accountability raises 
questions about the attorney’s commitment to ethical standards and procedural integrity, 
and it is perplexing that any reviewing judge could ignore the severity of the issues 
documented in this brief. 
38. It remains unanswered how a citizen of this state can be removed from his 
home and stripped of custody of his children based solely on unproven accusations by the 
other parent, without the opportunity to defend himself. Our society—and especially our 
children—should not be subjected to this level of disregard by elected officials. 
39. When such actions come from a vindictive parent willing to falsify their 
financial status and weave a false narrative for protection, the court should take 
appropriate action to prevent such deceptive actions from occurring in the future, and 
should surely be a factor in determining their fitness as a parent.

Recusing Judges Munford and Kaitcer is the first step to restore the Respondent’s 
rights as all other state remedies have been exhausted. These are essential first steps this 
court can now take. These actions will not only uphold Canon 3(D)’s standards but will

the highest principles of fairness and impartiality. Such measures will allow new judges 
to enter the case for a review the facts unobscured by the intentional deceptions that have 
compromised these proceedings, ultimately protecting the children’s best interests as 
mandated by the Texas Family Code. 
Given the court’s decision to stop docketing pleadings at the time the recusal 
motion was filed, along with its handling of the matter outside established legal 
standards, any reasonable member of the public, fully informed of the facts, would 
reasonably question whether the judges were acting impartially in this case. 
Such impartiality has rewarded a mother that has fabricated not only her financial 
status to this court, but also a false need for protection that should be taken as serious 
violations that are apparent from the face of her pleadings. To continuously deprive a 
parent of his constitutionally protected rights to his children and residency despite being 
given every opportunity to correct the situation showcases a blatant refusal by the current 
judges to either fix the situation or provide legal justification for their decisions. 
Without a factual basis or explanation for the court’s decisions, they must be 
recused so that the truth of the matter may be addressed after ten wasted months. The 
court must not tolerate the levels of deception and fraud committed by the Petitioner, and 
the Respondent reiterates that despite the egregious acts taken against him in totality, he 
holds no ill will toward any participant in this matter, and solely seeks a just and swift 
resolution for the sake of his children.

V. PRAYER
The respondent respectfully requests the following relief from this court: 
1. Immediately recuse both judge James Munford and Jeff Kaitcer from
this matter by a date deemed appropriate by the court should no
response be filed from the opposing party in opposition to the relief
requested herein.
2. Require that the clerk of the court docket the missing documents in
accordance with the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 21a found in
Exhibit 4.Click for reference.
3. Take judicial notice of the Petitioner’s deception by examining her

AFFIDAVIT OF CHARLES MYERS 
STATE OF TEXAS 
COUNTY OF TARRANT 
BEFORE ME, the undersigned authority, on this day personally appeared Charles Dustin 
Myers, who, after being duly sworn, did depose and state as follows: 
1. Introduction and Background
My name is Charles Dustin Myers, and I am the Respondent in the case No. 322-
744263-23 & No. 322-744538-23, In the Matter of the Marriage of Morgan
Michelle Myers & Charles Dustin Myers and in the Interest of M.E.M. & C.R.M.,
Minor Children, currently pending in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County,
Texas. I am above 18 years of age, competent to make this affidavit, and have
personal knowledge of the facts stated herein, which are true and correct.
2. Procedural Violations and Due Process Concerns
Since the initiation of this case, I have encountered numerous procedural
irregularities that have obstructed my right to a fair hearing. I was removed from
my residence and separated from my children on January 16, 2024, based solely
on allegations made by the Petitioner, without any evidentiary findings or an
opportunity to defend myself in a formal hearing. This deprivation of my rights
was executed without adherence to the foundational principles of due process.
3. Duress in Signing the February 1, 2024, Agreement
On February 1, 2024, I was compelled to sign an agreement that I did not fully

opportunity to defend myself in a formal hearing. This deprivation of my rights

3. Duress in Signing the February 1, 2024, Agreement

On February 1, 2024, I was compelled to sign an agreement that I did not fully

understand nor agree with. This agreement allowed me limited access back into 
my residence but resulted in the removal of my children from their home. My 
decision to sign was made under duress, as I was advised by my attorney to accept 
these terms rather than proceed to a hearing, due to the potential of further 
exclusion from my home and livelihood. I felt I had no other viable option to 
safeguard my ability to continue providing for my children. 
4. Bias and Lack of Impartiality
I have serious concerns regarding the impartiality of Judges Munford and Kaitcer,
as the procedural management of this case has shown a consistent disregard for
my rights. My filings and objections have been met with resistance and have often
been undocketed or handled irregularly, while the Petitioner’s pleadings have
proceeded unchecked, despite containing misleading and unsubstantiated claims.
This pattern of favoritism and procedural leniency towards the Petitioner has
compromised the integrity of these proceedings.
5. Misrepresentation and Lack of Consent in Orders
The current orders on record falsely state that both parties appeared before the
court on February 1, 2024, announced readiness, and signed an agreed associate
judge’s report. In reality, there was no formal hearing or review of evidence on
that date, and I did not give my consent to the terms as recorded. Furthermore, the
orders assert that necessary legal prerequisites were met, when, in fact, no such
procedural steps were observed. These inaccuracies directly impact my rights and
the fairness of these proceedings.

6. Unethical Conduct and Professional Misconduct
The Petitioner’s counsel, Ms. Carter, signed and submitted pleadings containing
false statements, misrepresenting my consent to the orders and claiming that a
hearing had occurred when it had not. This conduct violates Rule 4.01(a) of the
Texas Rules of Disciplinary Conduct and Canon 3(D)(2) of the Texas Code of
Judicial Conduct. Such behavior not only misleads the court but also deprives me
of a fair and just resolution.
7. Need for Recusal
Given these procedural irregularities, false representations, and lack of impartiality
demonstrated by Judges Munford and Kaitcer, I respectfully request their recusal
from this case. Their actions and the management of this case have created an
appearance of partiality, depriving me of my right to due process and casting
doubt on the integrity of these proceedings.
8. Request for Judicial Review and Corrective Action
I request that this court take immediate action to address the procedural oversights,
docket missing filings as per Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and ensure an
impartial review of the facts in this case. I seek a fair hearing, free from bias,
where the truth can be assessed without obstruction. In the interest of justice, I also
urge the court to examine the Petitioner’s documented misrepresentations and their
impact on the well-being of my children, M.E.M. and C.R.M.

Dear Lindsay Baker,

| hope this email finds you well. | am writing to inform you that my Motion to Recuse, referenced in your message, may
have been forwarded without the attached exhibits and affidavits that are critical to the motion.

The exhibits and affidavits provide necessary evidence and support for my claims, and it is important that the court has
access to the full record. Could you please confirm whether these documents were received with my motion? It raises
further concern that they are missing.

Please let me know the appropriate process to ensure that these documents are added to the court’s record. Thank you

M.185 our attention to this matter. M.1352

The exhibits were e-filed and are included in the Courts file.

If you received a Notice of Dismissal, you MUST file a Motion to Retain. The Motion
MUST be SET, HEARD and concluded with a SIGNED ORDER TO RETAIN.

DO NOT EMAIL ME FOR A SETTING REGARDING THE DWOP.

YOU MUST APPEAR IN PERSON TO SET THE HEARING.

All Orders that require the Judge’s signature must be presented in person and
will not be processed through e-filing.

Dear Ms. Baker,

Thank you for your response, and would just ask for some clarification on a couple of things.

There are noticable discrepancies between the file | submitted, accepted and available on the reSearchTX platform versus
what appears in the court's receipt to the Regional Judge. My original submission was 20.21 MB, while the version in the
courts email is 423 KB. Additionally, my receipt provides no indication that the exhibits were filed alongside the motion,
particularly the affidavit, which is referenced in the table of contents.

The document | submitted was also hyperlinked, but those links are missing in the court’s receipt.

Could you please clarify which court system the file is currently in and explain for what purpose the file was modified to
appear as if it were an unverified motion?

| would appreciate your prompt attention to this matter at your earliest convenience.
Best regards,
Charles Myers

OBJECTION AND REQUEST 
TO DOCKET  
Respondent respectfully objects to the handling of the case documents regarding 
the joint motion to recuse filed on October 7th, 2024 for the foregoing reasons:

7f9852d3f4205e0083d02b0536696131) See attached Exhibit A. 
2. The correspondence to Regional Judge David Evans from District Judge James
Munford has not been docketed. 
3. The amended order of referral signed on October 9th, 2024, by District Judge
James Munford has not been docketed.

4. The correspondence and order of referral to Regional Judge David Evans from
Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer signed October 10th, 2024, has not been docketed. 
II. RELEVANT COURT RULES
5. According to Rule 25 and Rule 26 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, the
clerk is required to maintain a file docket and a court docket that record all filings, 
motions, orders, and proceedings in a case. The failure to properly docket these 
documents violates these rules and further compromises the integrity of the case record. 
III. INCONSISTENT RESPONSES AND FAILURE TO FOLLOW PROTOCOL
6. The Respondent was initially informed via email that the exhibits and affidavits
had been filed. However, after the Respondent pointed out discrepancies in file size, the 
explanation changed to the document being too large. This inconsistency raises concerns 
about transparency and procedural fairness. Exhibit B 
7. As outlined in the Tarrant County FAQ, Respondent's original submission of 20
MB was well within the 36 MB limit, and the Respondent followed all proper e-filing 
procedures. Despite this, the filing was forwarded to the regional judge without the 
exhibits and affidavits and later split into three sections due to the supposed size limit—
yet the documents were never subsequently docketed.

8. Despite the emails sent to the Respondent from the court coordinator Lindsey 
Baker, there is no official receipt that the correct motion, as filed, was delivered to the 
regional judge from either respondent. 
 
9. The motion as originally filed was modified for reasons that did not remain 
persistent. The reasoning given related to file size contradicts the FAQ from the Tarrant 
County District Clerk. If a separate system is used to forward these files to the Regional 
Judge, the Respondent respectfully requests that this be clarified given the severity of the 
situation. 
CONCLUSION AND REQUEST 
Given the persistent inconsistencies, failure to properly docket the Respondent's 
filings, and the lack of transparency surrounding the handling of crucial case documents, 
Respondent Charles Dustin Myers formally objects to the actions of the 322nd District 
Court and requests immediate correction of the docketing failures. Furthermore, 
Respondent requests validation that the correct motions and accompanying exhibits were 
forwarded to the regional judge as originally filed. The files officially served to the 
Respondent via eFile do not contain the original joint motion. In light of these ongoing 
procedural issues, Respondent reserves the right to seek further remedies unless proper 
procedural requirements are followed to ensure equal protection under the United States 
Constitution.

8. Despite the emails sent to the Respondent from the court coordinator Lindsey
Baker, there is no official receipt that the correct motion, as filed, was delivered to the

regional judge from either respondent.

9. The motion as originally filed was modified for reasons that did not remain
persistent. The reasoning given related to file size contradicts the FAQ from the Tarrant
County District Clerk. If a separate system is used to forward these files to the Regional
Judge, the Respondent respectfully requests that this be clarified given the severity of the

situation.

CONCLUSION AND REQUEST

Given the persistent inconsistencies, failure to properly docket the Respondent's
filings, and the lack of transparency surrounding the handling of crucial case documents,
Respondent Charles Dustin Myers formally objects to the actions of the 322nd District
Court and requests immediate correction of the docketing failures. Furthermore,
Respondent requests validation that the correct motions and accompanying exhibits were
forwarded to the regional judge as originally filed. The files officially served to the
Respondent via eFile do not contain the original joint motion. In light of these ongoing
procedural issues, Respondent reserves the right to seek further remedies unless proper
procedural requirements are followed to ensure equal protection under the United States

Constitution.
