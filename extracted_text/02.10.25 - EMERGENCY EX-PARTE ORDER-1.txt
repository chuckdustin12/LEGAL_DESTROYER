TO THE HONORABLE DAVID L. EVANS, REGIONAL PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE

8TH ADMINISTRATIVE REGION OF TEXAS:

I. INTRODUCTION

1. The policy of this State regarding divorce with children is clear. It is to “assure
that children will have frequent and continuing contact with parents who have shown the
ability to act in the best interest of the child.” TEX. FAM. CODE 153.001. The Texas

legislature has also made it clear that the best interest of the child “shall always be the

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
primary consideration of the court in determining the issues of conservatorship and 
possession of and access to the child.” TEX. FAM. CODE 153.002 (emphasis added). 
The word always appears just once within the text of the Family Code, and it re-enforces 
the State’s policy by ensuring the best interest of the child standard is always applied; on 
all occasions – the literal definition of always. 
 
2. Here, in the instant case, this court has enabled a deliberate scheme orchestrated 
by the Petitioner, MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS, to escape accountability. This has left 
the children without either parent, without the stability they had known their entire lives, 
and without the financial and emotional support which had been provided to them by the 
Respondent up until this court’s intervention on January 16, 2025. 
 
3. This emergency has been ongoing for several months, and not one trace of 
engagement or opposition can be found on this docket from the opposing side. The 
recusal motion filed on October 7, 2024, was a strategic move in a larger strategy 
designed to force the ball into the opposing counsel’s hands to highlight her inability to 
prosecute the case, respond to any pleadings, or serve pleadings via the EFM as required 
by law. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 21(f)(1). This in and of itself warrants immediate attention. 
 
4. This emergency motion seeks the immediate restoration of the Respondent’s 
parental rights, immediate restoration to his residency, a temporary restraining order 
against the Petitioner to prevent any further harm or disruption to the Children’s status 
quo, and for sanctions, contempt, and an emergency stay pending a trial on the merits. 
 
5. In support of this emergency motion, the Respondent reasserts the following un-
opposed facts:

II. ONGOING IRREPRABLE HARM 
6. On January 16, 2024, this Court unilaterally severed the meaningful and 
sustained paternal engagement of a dedicated father in his children's daily lives, despite 
clear and compelling evidence of his active role in fostering their intellectual, emotional, 
and psychological development. This abrupt and unwarranted disruption of a 
foundational parental bond has precipitated severe instability in the children's structured 
routine and psychological well-being. Under Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002, which 
unequivocally asserts that "the best interest of the child shall always be the primary 
consideration of the court," the exclusion of a fit and involved parent represents a 
manifest deviation from established statutory principles. 
7. The court's initial determination was subsequently exploited to coerce the 
Respondent into a settlement agreement that remains operative, though it lacks 
substantive judicial scrutiny and legitimacy. This agreement, a perfunctory legal 
document drafted by the Petitioner’s counsel, COOPER L. CARTER—who lacks the 
requisite standing to represent the Petitioner in this matter—erroneously purports that the 
imposed orders reflect a mutual accord and serve the children's paramount interests. 
8. Since the Petitioner’s unlawful and unilateral expulsion of the Respondent from 
his residence on March 6, 2024, the stable and structured living conditions of the children 
have been systematically dismantled. Deprived of direct parental care and economic 
stability, the children have been subjected to profound and sustained disruption. 
Furthermore, the Petitioner has demonstrated a pattern of medical negligence, having

Furthermore, the Petitioner has demonstrated a pattern of medical negligence, having

failed to provide necessary dental care for the youngest child, whose untreated cavities 
remain an urgent and unresolved health concern. 
9. The children now exist under the intermittent supervision of extended family 
members in an unstructured and ad hoc manner. One such individual, CAITLIN 
WILSON, who has taken up residence in the former matrimonial home, possesses no 
parental credentials or experience. Despite her lack of qualification, she has assumed 
disciplinary authority over the children, an overreach that has resulted in confusion and 
on at least one occurrence, physical bruising on one child's arm. 
10. The Petitioner has deliberately obstructed the children's communication with 
the Respondent, has discarded his personal property still located within the matrimonial 
home, and facilitated the routine presence of her extramarital partner in the children’s 
domestic sphere. These actions illustrate a gross indifference to the children's emotional 
security and a flagrant breach of fundamental parental ethics and moral considerations. 
11. The children, once flourishing in academic and extracurricular pursuits, have 
now been entirely stripped of these essential developmental activities. They have accrued 
numerous unexcused school absences and, during their limited interactions with the 
Respondent, consistently express distress and uncertainty regarding his return to their 
daily lives, something they need and expect. 
12. The Petitioner has established a pattern of neglect, frequently leaving the 
children unattended overnight without adult supervision. The Respondent’s only viable 
means of interaction with his children is through intermediaries, specifically the

Petitioner’s elderly grandparents, or through an online video game platform, ROBLOX, 
which provides a limited forum for communication. 
13. Despite prior representations to this Court attesting to her intent to act in the 
children’s best interests, the Petitioner’s actions unequivocally demonstrate a 
prioritization of her own personal desires over the well-being of her children. Her 
persistent obstruction of the Respondent’s parental rights and her reckless disregard for 
the children's stability have engendered ongoing, irreparable harm, necessitating urgent 
judicial intervention. 
14. This Court has, in effect, granted unchecked authority to a vindictive parent, 
allowing her to systematically dismantle the children's stability, neglect their access to 
medical care, and deliberately engineer financial ruin by misleading the Court to secure 
the wrongful eviction of the Respondent. Despite these grave allegations being raised 
repeatedly, the Court has failed to demand accountability or address the substantive 
concerns. The Petitioner has further neglected to secure health insurance for the children, 
exacerbating their vulnerabilities, while even her own grandparents have corroborated the 
concerns raised in this motion regarding the children's deteriorating well-being. 
15. Notwithstanding the Petitioner’s egregious misconduct, the Respondent has 
maintained text and video evidence underscoring his ability to sustain a positive and 
collaborative relationship with the grandparents, who share his commitment to the 
children’s best interests. This court must act now, and Texas law and standing precedent 
entitles this relief to Respondent and his minor children as a matter of law, and such relief 
would serve the best interests of his children.

III. LEGAL BASIS 
A. Emergency ex-parte custody orders. 
16. Texas law permits a court to issue an ex-parte emergency order modifying 
child custody only if there is immediate danger to the child’s physical or emotional well-
being. Texas Family Code § 105.001 grants courts authority to issue temporary orders 
“for the safety and welfare of the child,” including orders modifying conservatorship and 
possession. The unilateral expulsion of the Respondent from the children’s lives has 
destabilized their structured routine and deprived them of critical emotional and financial 
support. The Petitioner’s documented history of obstructing communication, medical 
neglect, absences from school, and the placement of an unqualified third party in a 
disciplinary role over the children creates a direct and ongoing risk of harm. 
17. The Respondent’s allegations, supported by evidence and unopposed, satisfy 
the statutory burden required under Texas Family Code §§ 105.001 and 156.006(b)(1). 
The children’s best interest necessitates immediate relief restoring the Respondent’s 
access to his children and reestablishing a stable custody arrangement. 
B. Exclusive use of the marital residence. 
 
18. Texas courts have the authority to award exclusive use of the marital home 
during a pending divorce or custody dispute when necessary for the protection and 
stability of the children. See Texas Family Code § 6.502. In re Fallon Brown, No. 10-23-
00046-CV (Tex. App.—Waco 2023, orig. proceeding), emphasizes that courts should 
consider the impact of disruption when determining exclusive occupancy of a home. The 
impact would be significant as it would restore the Respondent’s ability to provide for his

during a pending divorce or custody dispute when necessary for the protection and

children, would restore an active and involved parent into their lives, and would prevent 
the third parties from assuming a parental role during the pendency of the case. The 
Petitioner has several alternative housing options which are in close proximity to the 
matrimonial home, a far better solution than the current situation provides for the 
children. 
 
19. Given these circumstances, the Respondent meets the legal burden for 
exclusive use of the home until a final hearing on the merits notwithstanding the 
procedural bias that he has suffered over the last year. 
C. Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) 
 
20. A Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) may be granted ex-parte to prevent 
imminent and irreparable harm. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 680 states that a TRO may 
be issued without notice if “immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result 
before notice can be given and a hearing held.” If not granted, the children will continue 
to be without either parent, and will lack the much needed guidance that Respondent is 
able to provide. Texas Family Code § 105.001(b) provides that a TRO in a child custody 
case does not require the standard “irreparable injury” showing required in other civil 
matters. 
 
21. The Petitioner’s obstruction of the Respondent’s access to his children, 
disposal of his property, and reckless introduction of unstable living conditions creates an 
urgent need for court intervention.

urgent need for court intervention.

22. A TRO against the Petitioner is necessary to:

=== PAGE 8 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
 
 
i. Restrict the Petitioner from further interfering with the Respondent’s 
custodial rights and disposing of his personal, separate property. 
 
 
ii. Prevent any further removal of the children from their established 
routines and access to necessary medical care. 
 
 
iii. Ensure that the Respondent’s rights to communication and property are 
protected until a full hearing on temporary orders can be held or until the case is 
inevitably dismissed for want of prosecution. 
D. Child support 
 
23. At present, there exists no legally recognized child support arrangement for the 
minor children. The existing judicial directives are void ab initio, unenforceable, and 
were fraudulently procured. The Petitioner has historically refrained from seeking gainful 
employment, only recently making efforts to secure work. This shift in employment 
status transpired subsequent to the deliberate and strategic diminution of the 
Respondent’s earnings from an annual income exceeding $96,000 to a mere $12,000, a 
direct and foreseeable consequence of the court orders obtained through 
misrepresentation and procedural manipulation. 
 
24. The Respondent’s reintegration into his children's lives is not only essential to 
fostering a meaningful parental relationship but also pivotal in establishing a legitimate 
and enforceable child support framework. Furthermore, this reintegration will contribute 
to rectifying the significant financial detriment inflicted by the Petitioner, which presently 
surpasses $90,000 in quantifiable losses. Despite this, the Respondent is committed to 
ensuring that the Children maintain a relationship with their Mother.

E. Sanctions and Contempt 
 
25. Courts maintain inherent authority to hold individuals in contempt and impose 
sanctions for noncompliance with judicial orders, perpetration of fraud upon the court, 
and the submission of materially false statements under oath. The Petitioner, in concert 
with her legal counsel, has exhibited a pattern of egregious disregard for ethical and 
procedural standards. The persistent failure to respond to legal filings, engage in 
substantive argumentation, or adhere to procedural obligations underscores a sustained 
course of misconduct and bad faith participation in the judicial process. 
 
26. In the instant case, the Petitioner submitted fraudulent documents which were 
prepared in part by her Stepfather, Dan Branthoover, who is currently being sued in the 
Western District of Oklahoma for his involvement in this matter. The Petitioner has 
disregarded the well-being of her children, stripped away their financial stability, has 
made no effort to get them the medial care they need, and has now left them in the care of 
third parties who share similar concerns that are being raised within this motion. She 
fabricated her financial status, falsified the need for protection, and has made a mockery 
of individuals who truly rely on such tools for genuine protection. 
 
27. This Court must not allow such flagrant abuse of the judicial system to go 
unchecked. The Petitioner's willful engagement in deceit and manipulation necessitates 
immediate and decisive action. Her fraudulent filings and continued bad faith conduct 
demonstrate an utter disregard for the integrity of the legal process. The Court should 
impose severe sanctions to deter further misconduct, including but not limited to

monetary penalties, an adverse inference against her claims, and referral for criminal 
perjury investigation. Her actions not only undermine the credibility of these proceedings 
but also inflict tangible harm on those directly affected, particularly the children she has 
so callously neglected. Justice demands that this Court hold the Petitioner accountable for 
her egregious actions and enforce the full weight of its authority to prevent further 
perversion of due process. 
F. Notice of past due findings of facts and conclusions of law 
 
28. Should the court elect not to grant this motion forthwith as statutorily 
mandated, the Respondent formally reiterates the request for the outstanding findings of 
fact and conclusions of law, initially sought on March 26, 2024, concerning the extant 
orders. 
29. Specifically, the Respondent petitions the court to elucidate the precise 
jurisprudential rationale underpinning the current orders, explicate the manner in which 
they purportedly serve the paramount welfare of the minor children, and delineate the 
evidentiary substratum upon which the court predicates its determinations.

properly and timely invoked. The absence of such findings materially impedes the 
Respondent’s capacity to mount a cogent challenge or pursue an informed appellate

IV. CONCLUSION 
31. In light of the foregoing, the Respondent respectfully submits that the 
egregious actions and persistent misconduct of the Petitioner have inflicted immediate 
and irreparable harm upon the minor children and have unjustly deprived the Respondent 
of his rightful and established role in their lives. The unilateral disruption of a nurturing 
and stable familial environment, coupled with the deliberate manipulation of judicial 
proceedings, not only undermines the fundamental best interest of the children as 
mandated by Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002 but also threatens their ongoing physical, 
emotional, and psychological well-being. 
32. Respondent is committed to restoring the stability of his Children, maintaining 
an amicable relationship with the grandparents, and commit to getting healthcare for the 
Children, assisting them with their school-work, and ensure that their lives get back on 
track while fostering a meaningful co-parenting relationship with the Petitioner despite 
her actions. 
V. PRAYER FOR IMMEDIATE RELIEF 
33. For the reasons stated herein, and in the interest of preserving the well-being 
and stability of the minor children, the Respondent respectfully requests that this Court 
act expeditiously to restore equilibrium to the family unit and prevent further injustice.
 
34. Accordingly, the Respondent prays that this Honorable Court immediately 
grant the following relief without notice to the opposing party:

her actions.

V. PRAYER FOR IMMEDIATE RELIEF

33. For the reasons stated herein, and in the interest of preserving the well-being
and stability of the minor children, the Respondent respectfully requests that this Court
act expeditiously to restore equilibrium to the family unit and prevent further injustice.

34. Accordingly, the Respondent prays that this Honorable Court immediately

grant the following relief without notice to the opposing party:

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
i. Restoration of Parental Rights: Order the prompt and full restoration of the 
Respondent’s parental rights, thereby reinstating his vital and direct 
involvement in the daily care, guidance, and support of his minor children. 
ii. Exclusive Use of the Matrimonial Residence: Grant the Respondent 
exclusive use of the marital residence during the pendency of the case, thereby 
safeguarding the children’s stability and ensuring an environment conducive to 
their healthy development. 
iii. Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO): Issue an immediate 
TRO against the Petitioner to prevent any further actions that could exacerbate 
the harm to the children, including, but not limited to, obstructing 
communication with the Respondent, disposing of his personal property, or 
otherwise disrupting the established custodial arrangements. 
iv. Sanctions and Contempt Findings: Impose appropriate sanctions and hold 
the Petitioner in contempt for her deliberate violations of judicial procedures, 
fraudulent representations, and actions that flagrantly undermine the integrity 
of these proceedings, and scrutinize her attorney’s failure to abide by the Texas 
Rules of Civil Procedure. 
v. Further Relief as Deemed Just and Proper: Grant any other relief that this 
Court may deem just and proper in order to protect the best interests of the 
minor children, to redress the significant financial and emotional detriment 
suffered by the Respondent, and to uphold the sanctity of the judicial process.

AFFIDAVIT OF CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS 
I, Charles Dustin Myers, am the Respondent in above matter, and am the biological father 
of my minor children, whose welfare and stability have remained my paramount concern. Since 
the Court’s intervention on January 16, 2024, I have been unjustly extricated from their lives, 
despite my demonstrable history as their primary caregiver and financial anchor. My presence 
has provided them with structured domesticity, intellectual enrichment, and consistent emotional 
reinforcement. 
The Texas Family Code establishes the primacy of the child’s best interests in judicial 
determinations of conservatorship and parental access. Notwithstanding this legal directive, my 
involuntary absence has precipitated substantial disruptions in their psychological and financial 
security. Their previously regimented daily schedule has been dismantled, yielding deleterious 
effects on their academic trajectory and medical welfare. They have foregone crucial healthcare, 
exhibited marked distress, and have vocalized persistent inquiries regarding my return. 
Moreover, the imposition of a non-parental figure as a disciplinary authority within their home 
has exacerbated their vulnerability and imposed unwarranted emotional duress. 
I contend that the Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, has strategically manipulated legal 
mechanisms to advance her personal objectives at the expense of our children’s fundamental 
needs. Through the propagation of false assertions and procedural obfuscation, she has 
systematically obstructed my parental rights, expunged my personal property, and engineered a 
campaign of alienation. Her misrepresentations before the Court have precipitated adverse 
rulings, engendering further destabilization and compounding financial hardship. 
Despite these egregious circumstances, my commitment to my children remains resolute. It is 
imperative that I am reinstated in their lives to reestablish stability, ensure their continued 
educational and medical access, and furnish them with the emotional and structural continuity

they have been unjustly denied. I am fully prepared to engage in a constructive co-parenting 
framework, mitigate the deleterious consequences of these proceedings, and reconstitute a 
nurturing, equilibrated environment for their development. 
My petition to return to the marital residence is not predicated upon material possession 
but is instead an urgent endeavor to rectify the harm inflicted upon my children. The protracted 
deprivation of my presence has subjected them to undue hardship, and any further delay in 
remedial intervention will only intensify their distress. My steadfast objective is to reinstate their 
stability, safeguard their best interests, and restore a legally and ethically sound parental 
arrangement. To that end, I solemnly affirm my adherence to the highest standards of parental 
responsibility, including a commitment to respectful co-parenting and transparent judicial 
oversight through periodic status reports on their well-being. 
I affirm under penalty of perjury that the statements made within this request for relief are 
true and accurate to the best of my knowledge, and affirm that despite the Petitioner’s actions, I 
hold no ill-will against her and simply wish to uphold the level of care that my children have 
been accustomed to during this challenging time of their lives. All pleadings filed in this case 
have been in an effort to advocate for my children and were filed in a good faith effort to bring 
the facts, which are now undisputed, to this court’s attention. 
FURTHER AFFIANT SAYETH NOT.
