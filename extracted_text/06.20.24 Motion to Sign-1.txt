In this instance, Branthoover’s actions went beyond legal disputes, extending

19. On December 19, 2023, the day after the divorce was filed, Branthoover 
reached out to Plaintiff via text message and held himself out to be Wife’s attorney

31. Defendant’s conduct as detailed in this complaint includes actions that 
constitute violations of Oklahoma Statute §21-453, which criminalizes the 
preparation of false evidence with intent to present it as genuine in legal 
proceedings. Here, this is exactly what occurred when Defendant assisted Wife in 
the preparation of her original petition for divorce which claimed an active order 
of protection existed against Plaintiff, and which was filed claiming Wife to be 
indigent. Defendant knew these statements were false as by his own admission he 
facilitated the transfer of $1,576 to her account. 
32. These documents were prepared in Yukon, Oklahoma, and then 
submitted to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County, Texas, who relied on the 
documents to Plaintiff’s detriment. Defendant’s felonious behavior was 
intentionally aimed at harming Plaintiff and was rooted in deceit. 
COUNT TWO: DECEIT 
Defendant’s actions constitute a violation of Title 76 OS § 1 et seq., as he 
knowingly and willfully deceived Plaintiff with the specific intent to induce 
detrimental reliance, thereby exposing Plaintiff to injury. Consequently, the 
Defendant is liable for the damages resulting from his conduct. 
 
32. Paragraphs 1 through 31 are incorporated herein by reference. 
31. Defendant persuaded the Plaintiff that his wife bringing their children to

32. Defendant knew this assertion to be false, as prior to making this 
statement he was actively assisting wife in an effort to have the Plaintiff removed 
from his home through an ex-parte temporary order of protection. 
33. Defendant's selective disclosure to the Plaintiff about the discussions 
surrounding the divorce, while concealing his significant involvement in drafting 
legal documents for the Wife, constitutes deceit under element 3 of 76 OK Stat § 
3(3). By presenting only partial information and withholding his full participation, 
Defendant provided misleading context that was likely to—and did—mislead the 
Plaintiff regarding the nature of his involvement, which lead to significant 
damages, making defendant liable for any damage which he thereby suffered.

37. Defendant’s actions deprived Plaintiff of the use and benefit of these 
funds, causing financial harm, including an overdraft of $800, the loss of $1,576, 
the discontinuation of certain business advertising, and prevented him from getting 
his children Christmas gifts as he had planned to purchase over the weekend. 
38. Under Oklahoma and Texas law, conversion is complete when the holder 
of personal property asserts rights inconsistent with the title of the owner. Russell v. 
City State Bank of Wellington, Texas, 264 F. Supp. at 574. In this case, Defendant’s 
conduct demonstrates an assertion of rights inconsistent with the Plaintiff’s 
ownership and legal entitlement to the funds. By knowingly and intentionally 
directing the transfer of $1,576 from the joint marital account to his PayPal account 
without Plaintiff’s consent, Branthoover deprived Plaintiff of his rightful possession 
and control over the funds, completing the tort of conversion as described in Russell.

that “one who by extreme and outrageous conduct intentionally or recklessly 
causes severe emotional distress to another is subject to liability for such 
emotional distress.”. Defendant’s conduct was both intentional and reckless, as the 
fraudulent documents prepared by him lead to the loss of Plaintiff’s business, 
home, and the custody of this Children. 
 
42. After Plaintiff suffered these losses, Defendant continued to harass the 
Plaintiff by texting him throughout the proceeds he helped initiate, calling him 
“pathetic” and stating that he has “enjoyed watching every filing get denied”. This 
conduct is outrageous because the harm suffered by Plaintiff was a direct cause of 
Defendant’s actions, and Defendant’s clear interest in the case has been made 
apparent on top of his enjoyment of the damages he has caused to Plaintiff through 
his own admission. 
 
43. Further, Defendant knew that father operated his business out of his 
residency, and by playing a crucial role in his removal, knew that financial 
damages would occur as a result.

familial relationships, which have all caused severe emotional distress. 
Loss of income 
 
47. Starting in December 2023, the Defendant’s involvement directly 
disrupted Plaintiff’s ability to focus on business operations and maintain client 
relationships. This disruption coincided with an accelerated decline in income, as 
reflected by Plaintiff’s income showing a sharper drop in monthly earnings. 
48. Prior to the Defendant’s involvement, Plaintiff’s average monthly income 
from Source 1 was approximately $3,612.83 over the 13 months preceding 
December 2023. Following the Defendant’s involvement, Plaintiff’s average

familial relationships, which have all caused severe emotional distress.

Loss of income

47. Starting in December 2023, the Defendant’s involvement directly
disrupted Plaintiff's ability to focus on business operations and maintain client
relationships. This disruption coincided with an accelerated decline in income, as
reflected by Plaintiff's income showing a sharper drop in monthly earnings.

48. Prior to the Defendant’s involvement, Plaintiff's average monthly income
from Source | was approximately $3,612.83 over the 13 months preceding

December 2023. Following the Defendant’s involvement, Plaintiff's average

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
monthly income dropped to $1,813.02, representing a significant reduction of nearly 
50%. Over the subsequent 13 months, this decline resulted in a total income loss of 
approximately $23,397.60. (Exhibit) 
49. Similarly, Plaintiff’s Source 2 transaction revenue data reflects a 
comparable trend. The annual transaction revenue dropped from $26,514.94 in 2023 
to $15,099.78 in 2024, resulting in a loss of $11,415.16 over that period. 
50. The total realized loss of income, combining the actual reductions in 
earnings from Source 1 and Source 2, is $34,812.76. The projected loss of income 
over the next 12 months, based on forward-looking projections for Source 1 and 
Source 2, is $33,012.94 in consequential damages. Combined, the total loss of 
income is projected at $67,825.69 by this time next year given all circumstances are 
the same and factoring in consequential damages. 
Increased living expenses 
 
51. During the pendency of the litigation instigated by Defendant, Plaintiff 
has been unable to access his home, resulting in a substantial increase in living costs 
to remain nearby his children as they had been accustomed to. 
 
52. This forced Defendant to stay in hotels to exercise Thursday visitation 
and required him to rent local Airbnb locations to provide a stable living space for 
his children during extended periods. The total cost of Airbnbs during the relevant 
period is $14,553.89, and additional hotel costs amount to $873.31 to maintain the

status quo of the Children to the best of Plaintiff’s ability. Plaintiff also incurred toll 
costs while exercising visitation to see his children, totaling $2,160.28. This 
includes $450.61 and $492.00 on June 9, $887.92 on April 11, and $329.75 on April 
26. 
 
53. Total damages for cost-of-living increases and travel expenses that would 
not have been made without Defendant’s involvement amount to $17,587.48. 
Cost of litigation 
 
54. Plaintiff has also incurred damages relating to the cost of litigation, 
which amounts to $3,000 for the retainment of his prior attorney, $155 to file a 
mandamus in the Second Court of Appeals, $255 to obtain certified copies of the 
pleadings, and $405 when attempting to remove the case to federal court, totaling 
$3,815. 
Request for Jury Determination of Punitive Damages 
In this case, the Defendant exploited his offer of assistance to the Plaintiff, 
subsequently diverting marital funds and orchestrating the initiation of divorce 
proceedings with the intent to cause harm. These actions displaced the Plaintiff 
from his livelihood and were accompanied by mockery of his efforts to seek relief. 
Such conduct constitutes calculated deceit carried out with malice. 
The Defendant's prior convictions for violating protective orders and 
tampering with government documents further highlight a troubling pattern of

behavior that necessitates punitive damages. This damage is critical not only to 
hold the Defendant accountable but also to deter future misconduct and protect 
others from similar harm. 
Given that Title 23, Section 9.1 of the Oklahoma Statutes specifies the 
award of punitive damages by a jury, but does not explicitly address the process in 
a bench trial, the Plaintiff respectfully requests clarification on whether this court 
may directly assess punitive damages in this case. If the court determines that a 
jury trial is required to adjudicate punitive damages, the Plaintiff requests that the 
trial be bifurcated. Specifically, the Plaintiff seeks a preliminary bench trial to 
resolve issues of liability, compensatory damages, and special damages. Upon 
resolution of those matters, the Plaintiff requests a subsequent jury trial to 
determine punitive damages in accordance with §23-9.1 if required by law.

Dan, I'm going to need you to put the money back that i need
to pay our bills and clear my account deficit.

| move money around all the time, which is evident in the
transaction records and has always been in the best interest
of all of us.

This most recent move was malicious and manipulative, and
has negatively impacted our financial situation.

You should be trying to help resolve this - not further
complicate it.

| can't order any presents this weekend for the girls.

| can't work due to mental anguish - also not good for the
girls.

All I've done is try to explain that we should work on this -
especially when you look at the
facts versus the narrative.

Morgan needs insurance on the car. My own insurance is
now late. Water bill is late- which threatens our auto-pay
setup.

Despite not understanding any of this and none of it making
sense - | still have to do what's in the best interest for
Morgan and the girls, as | always have so long as | was
aware of what | needed to be working on.

There's still time to turn this around - hash it out, and realize
that this family and those two girls and everything we've
done are worth fighting for.

I'll keep trying until | can't.

We can still save Christmas.
