How can I Avoid Paying Interest Charges?  If you pay your New Balance in full by the due date  
each month , we will not charge interest on new transactions that post to the purchase balance. If 
you have been paying in full  without Interest Charges, but fail to pay your next New Balance in full, 
we will charge interest on the unpaid balance. Interest Charges on Cash Advances and Special 
Transfers start on the transaction date. Promotional offers may allow you to pay less than the total 
New Balance and avoid paying interest on new transactions that post to your purchase balance. 
See the front of your statement for additional information.  
 
How is the Interest Charge Determined?  Interest Charges accrue from the date of the 
transaction, date the transaction is processed or the first day of the Billing Cycle. Interest accrues 
daily on every unpaid amount until it is paid in full. Interest accrued during a Billing Cycle posts to 
your account at the end of the Billing cycle and appears on your next statement. You may owe 
Interest Charges even if you pay the entire New Balance one month, but did not do so the prior 
month. Once you start accruing Interest Charges, you generally must pay your New Balance in full 
two consecutive Billing Cycles before Interest Charges stop being posted to your Statement. 
Interest Charges are added to the corresponding segment of your account.  
 
Do you assess a Minimum Interest Charge? We may assess a minimum Interest Charge of 
$0.00 for each Billing Cycle if your account is subject to an Interest Charge.  
 
How do you Calculate the Interest Charge?  We use a method called Average Daily Balance 
(including new transactions). 
 
1. First, for each segment we take the beginning balance each day and add in new transactions and 
the periodic Interest Charge on the previous day's balance. Then we subtract any payments and 
credits for that segment as of that day. The result is the daily balance for each segment. However, if 
your previous statement balance was zero or a credit amount, new transactions which post to your 
purchase segment are not added to the daily balance.  
 
2. Next, for each segment, we add the daily balances together and divide the sum by the number of 
days in the Billing Cycle. The result is the Average Daily Balance for each segment. 
 
3. At the end of each Billing Cycle, we multiply your Average Daily Balance for each segment by 
the daily periodic rate (APR divided by 365) for that segment, and then we multiply the result by the 
number of days in the Billing Cycle. We add the Interest Charges for all segments together. The 
result is your total Interest Charge for the Billing Cycle. 
 
The Average Daily Balance is referred to as the Balance Subject to Interest Rate in the Interest 
Charge Calculation section of this Statement. 
 
NOTE: Due to rounding or a minimum Interest Charge, this calculation may vary slightly from the 
Interest Charge actually assessed. 
 
 
How can I Avoid Membership Fees? If a Renewal Notice is printed on this statement, you may 
avoid paying an annual membership Fee by contacting Customer Service fewer than 40 days after 
the annual membership Fee was assessed to request that we close your account. To avoid paying 
a monthly membership Fee, close your account and we will stop assessing your monthly 
membership Fee. 
 
How can I Close My Account? You can contact Customer Service anytime to request that we 
close your account. 
How do you Process Payments? When you make a payment, you authorize us to initiate an 
ACH or electronic payment that will be debited from your bank account or other related 
account. When you provide a check or check information to make a payment, you authorize us 
to use information from the check to make a one-time ACH or other electronic transfer from 
your bank account. We may also process it as a check transaction. Funds may be withdrawn 
from your bank account as soon as the same day we process your payment.  
 
How do you Apply My Payment? We generally apply payments up to your Minimum 
Payment first to the balance with the lowest APR (including 0% APR), and then to balances 
with higher APRs. We apply any part of your payment exceeding your Minimum Payment to 
the balance with the highest APR, and then to balances with lower APRs. 
 
Billing Rights Summary (Does not Apply to Small Business Accounts) 
What To Do If You Think You Find A Mistake On Your Statement: If you think there is an 
error on your statement, write to us at: 
P.O. Box 30285, Salt Lake City, UT 84130-0285.  
 
In your letter, give us the following information: 
• Account information: Your name and account number.  
• Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error. 
• Description of Problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is 
wrong and why you believe it is a mistake. You must contact us within 60 days after the error 
appeared on your statement. You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call 
us or notify us electronically, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential 
errors and you may have to pay the amount in question. We will notify you in writing within 30 
days of our receipt of your letter. While we investigate whether or not there has been an error, 
the following are true: 
• We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. 
The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you 
interest on that amount. But, if we determine that we made a mistake, you will not have to pay 
the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount. 
• While you do not have to pay the amount in question until we send you a notice about the 
outcome of our investigation, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance. 
• We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. Within 90 days of our receipt of 
your letter, we will send you a written notice explaining either that we corrected the error (to 
appear on your next statement) or the reasons we believe the bill is correct. 
 
Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Purchase: If you are dissatisfied with the 
goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good 
faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining 
amount due on the purchase. To use this right, the following must be true: 
1) You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash 
advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify; 
and  
2) You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.  
If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in 
writing at: P.O. Box 30285, Salt Lake City, UT 84130-0285. While we investigate, the same 
rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we 
will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay we 
may report you as delinquent.
