LETTER 
To the Honorable Clerk of the Supreme Court of Texas: 
This correspondence is respectfully submitted to notify the Court of parallel 
proceedings currently pending in the State of Oklahoma, which intersect factually 
and procedurally with the five mandamus petitions presently before this Court. 
On or about May 30, 2025, the Oklahoma state court issued a Show Cause 
Order in a related civil matter styled Myers v. Branthoover, concerning allegations 
that an out-of-state actor materially contributed to the fraudulent filings 
and procedural misconduct underlying the orders challenged in the Texas 
proceedings. The issuance of that order confirms that multiple jurisdictions are 
now engaged in reviewing coordinated acts of abuse, reinforcing both the factual 
legitimacy and urgent necessity of the relief sought in the pending mandamuses. 
The undersigned has refrained from effectuating service in Oklahoma while 
pursuing expedited emergency relief from this Court. The procedural posture of the 
Oklahoma action has now become directly relevant to this Court’s review, as it
