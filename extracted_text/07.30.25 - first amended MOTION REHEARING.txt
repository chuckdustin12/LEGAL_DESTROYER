NO. 25-0458 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF  
TEXAS 
 
 
 
 
TO THE HONORABLE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS: 
 
The gravity of the issues raised herein cannot be overstated. Relator 
respectfully submits that the legal positions at issue are most effectively conveyed 
through a medium in which he possesses subject-matter expertise. As a seasoned 
data analyst specializing in financial markets and macroeconomic systems, Relator 
asserts that his arguments are materially bolstered by judicial data that corroborates 
the claims presented in this proceeding, as well as in related matters currently 
pending before the Court under Cause Nos. 25-0361, 25-0367, 25-0378, and 25-
0426. Given the overlapping legal and factual contours of these cases—and the 
significant state-wide interest in the adjudication of the principles they collectively 
raise—Relator contends that consolidated or coordinated consideration of these 
matters is warranted and would serve the interests of judicial economy and 
fundamental fairness to take up these issues on rehearing. Therefore, Relator 
respectfully submits this First Amended Motion for Rehearing.

REHEARING
TO THE HONORABLE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS:

The gravity of the issues raised herein cannot be overstated. Relator
respectfully submits that the legal positions at issue are most effectively conveyed
through a medium in which he possesses subject-matter expertise. As a seasoned
data analyst specializing in financial markets and macroeconomic systems, Relator
asserts that his arguments are materially bolstered by judicial data that corroborates
the claims presented in this proceeding, as well as in related matters currently
pending before the Court under Cause Nos. 25-0361, 25-0367, 25-0378, and 25-

significant state-wide interest in the adjudication of the principles they collectively
raise—Relator contends that consolidated or coordinated consideration of these
matters is warranted and would serve the interests of judicial economy and
fundamental fairness to take up these issues on rehearing. Therefore, Relator

respectfully submits this First Amended Motion for Rehearing.

A. Key trend 
 
4. In just six full fiscal years AJR-8’s annual assignments have risen 45 % 
faster than the statewide total, driving its share from ~15 % to > 21 %. No other 
region breaks double digits. Jan–Aug 2018 is an eight-month snapshot, yet AJR-8 
already consumed one-sixth of every assignment. 
B. Run-away assignment volume 
 
5. In FY 2024 AJR-8 required 1,500 assignments—63 % more than the 
next-highest region (Region 4 at 864) . 
 
6. AJR-8’s four-year compound annual growth rate in assignments is 18 %, 
triple the statewide rate (~ 6 %). 
C. Out-sized draw on the visiting-judge pool 
 
7. Retired or former judges handled 86 % of all assignments statewide in 
FY 2024 . 
 
8. Because AJR-8 accounts for one in five assignments, its demand is 
materially reducing the availability of experienced visiting judges elsewhere, 
jeopardizing equitable docket relief across Texas. 
D. High correlation with recusal-driven work 
 
9. Statewide, “Recusal – Voluntary” was again the single largest trigger 
(35 % of assignments in FY 2024).

should direct the Office of Court Administration to conduct a root-cause audit and 
require quarterly reporting of region-level metrics. 
 
15. Vacancy and illness clusters further undermine docket stability in the 
region. Hundreds of vacant-bench coverage days recur annually, leaving litigants 
without access to a consistent, elected judge. The Court should review whether 
permanent judgeships, inter-county docket equalization, or remote-hearing 
technologies are needed to stabilize judicial presence. 
 
16. Finally, the persistent overuse of retired judges—who now handle 80% 
or more of assignments statewide—threatens institutional continuity. Succession 
planning and mentoring capacity are at risk. The Court should explore staggered 
visiting-judge rotations, modernized compensation structures, and targeted 
recruitment to sustain a capable pool. 
III. Reasons to Grant Rehearing 
 
17. The Supreme Court of Texas need not look far for a live-fire

Reports for Fiscal Years 2020–2024. The Myers litigation—already the source of 
five distinct petitions for writ of mandamus now before this court arising from a 
single family law case—offers a rare procedural prism through which to diagnose 
and correct the escalating dysfunction in the Eighth Administrative Judicial Region 
(AJR-8).

18. Each of the five Myers mandamus petitions centers on a different 
dimension of a common breakdown: fragmented judicial oversight, unchecked 
recusal churn, and litigant behavior increasingly calibrated to exploit procedural 
volatility rather than seek substantive justice. The convergence of these pressures 
in a single proceeding transforms Myers into something more than an outlier. It 
becomes a case study in miniature, ideally suited for court-directed systemic 
inquiry. 
 
19. These escalating numbers highlight the public confidence issues 
specifically raised in cause number 25-0367, which are growing exponentially. The 
lives of children, and many families of this State are being affected by this far-
reaching problem, including the Relator himself. 
 
20. In essence, the Myers case, with its five mandamus petitions with 
multiple judicial reassignments in the 8th Administrative Judicial Region (AJR-8), 
provides a concrete, data-driven vehicle for the Supreme Court of Texas to 
investigate and address systemic failures in the region’s judicial assignment 
system. Leveraging the Myers case in a rehearing can justify a broader inquiry or 
audit into AJR-8’s practices, using both the individual record and statewide data to 
prompt structural reforms. 
 
21. Through careful analysis, this Court could potentially identify solutions 
to key issues identified both in the Relator’s petitions and supporting data.

IV. Analysis 
A. The Systemic Problem in AJR-8 
 
22. The data from FY 2020 to FY 2024 show that AJR-8 has become a 
statistical outlier in the Texas judicial assignment system, absorbing over 21% of 
all visiting-judge assignments statewide—more than double what would be 
expected if assignments were distributed evenly. The region’s assignment volume 
has nearly doubled in four years, with a compound annual growth rate of 18%, far 
outpacing the statewide average. This surge is closely linked to a high rate of 
voluntary recusals, which now account for the majority of assignments, and to 
persistent bench instability, as evidenced by hundreds of days of vacant-bench 
coverage each year. 
 
23. These trends have significant consequences: they reduce the availability 
of experienced visiting judges for other regions, risk delays and inconsistent 
rulings, and threaten public confidence in the impartiality and stability of the 
judiciary. The data also suggests the possibility of systemic conflicts of interest, 
particularly given the high correlation between recusal-driven assignments and the 
overall assignment volume in AJR-8. 
B. The Myers Case as a Vehicle for Systemic Review

procedural odyssey in Myers—cycling through multiple visiting judges and 
repeated recusal motions—mirrors the statistical anomalies documented in the 
region’s assignment data. This makes Myers an ideal test case for the Supreme 
Court to address both the individual litigant’s grievances and the underlying 
systemic issues. 
25. Texas law provides a clear pathway for the Supreme Court to use the 
Myers case as an instrument for broader inquiry. Under Tex. Gov't. Code § 22.002, 
the Court has the authority to issue writs of mandamus to compel lower courts or 
judicial officers to perform their duties, particularly where there is evidence of 
systemic failure or abuse of discretion. The Court’s inherent power to protect the 
administration of justice, as recognized in Vondy v. Commissioners Court of 
Uvalde County, 620 S.W.2d 104 (Tex. 1981), further supports its ability to 
intervene when the integrity of the judicial system is at stake. 
26. Precedent also supports the use of mandamus in cases where the normal 
appellate process is inadequate to address urgent or systemic problems. In In re 
McAllen Medical Center, Inc., 275 S.W.3d 458 (Tex. 2008) and In re State, 355 
S.W.3d 611 (Tex. 2011), this Court held that mandamus is appropriate when there 
is a clear abuse of discretion and no adequate remedy by appeal, especially where 
mandamus can prevent wasted resources and protect the public interest.

27. The Myers case, with its repeated mandamus petitions and documented 
procedural breakdowns, meets these criteria. The record demonstrates not only 
individual harm but also a pattern of dysfunction that affects the administration of 
justice in AJR-8 and, by extension, the entire state. 
C. Mechanisms for Using Myers in a Rehearing 
 
28. In a rehearing, this Court can explicitly reference the Myers case as both 
a factual and statistical exemplar of the systemic issues in AJR-8. The Court could, 
for example, remand the case to the Office of Court Administration with 
instructions to catalog all recusal motions and assignments in AJR-8 since FY 
2020, and to report those findings to the Court. This would convert the individual 
grievance into a statewide diagnostic audit, providing the Court with the data 
needed to assess the root causes of the region’s assignment anomalies.  
 
29. The Court could also order mandatory reporting of recusal causes by 
county, commission a review of judicial conduct patterns in AJR-8, and evaluate 
whether additional permanent judgeships or other structural reforms are warranted. 
These actions are supported by the statutory duties of presiding judges to 
recommend changes for the improvement of justice administration and to provide 
statistical information to the Supreme Court. See Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.046.

fulfill its constitutional and statutory mandate to ensure the proper administration 
of justice statewide. 
D. Addressing Recusal and Assignment Procedures 
 
31. The high rate of recusals and visiting-judge assignments in AJR-8 raises 
questions about compliance with statutory and procedural safeguards. Texas law 
requires that recusal motions be handled promptly and that assignments of 
replacement judges follow established procedures. See Tex. Gov't. Code § 
24.002; Tex. Gov't. Code § 25.00255. The standards for recusal are mandatory and 
objective, requiring recusal whenever a judge’s impartiality might reasonably be 
questioned. See Rogers v. Bradley, 909 S.W.2d 872 (Tex. 1995); State v. 
Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft, 692 S.W.3d 467 (Tex. 2022. 
 
32. If the Myers case reveals that these procedures have not been followed, 
or that the volume of recusals is symptomatic of deeper conflicts or administrative 
failures, the Court has both the authority and the obligation to intervene. The 
Court’s power to adopt rules for efficient court management (Tex. Gov't. Code § 
74.024) and to require local administrative judges to provide statistical and 
management information (Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.092) further supports its ability to 
mandate corrective action.

E. Precedent for Systemic Relief 
 
33. The Supreme Court has previously recognized its ability to grant relief 
not only to individual litigants but also to address systemic threats to the 
administration of justice. In In re State Bar of Texas, 113 S.W.3d 730 (Tex. 2003), 
the Court held that it may exercise its mandamus jurisdiction directly in cases of 
compelling importance, bypassing the normal appellate process when necessary to 
protect the integrity of the judicial system. 
 
34. Similarly, in In re Prudential Ins. Co. of America, 148 S.W.3d 124 (Tex. 
2003), the Court abated proceedings to allow reconsideration by a new judge when 
the original judge left office, recognizing the importance of procedural regularity 
and the need to address changes in judicial assignment. These precedents support 
the use of the Myers case as a vehicle for broader systemic review and reform. 
V. Conclusion 
 
35. The Myers case, with its sequence of mandamus petitions and 
documented procedural breakdowns, is both a symptom and a symbol of the deeper 
structural problems afflicting AJR-8. By using Myers as a vehicle for rehearing and 
broader inquiry, the Supreme Court of Texas can fulfill its constitutional and 
statutory mandate to ensure the fair and efficient administration of justice. This

E. Precedent for Systemic Relief

33. The Supreme Court has previously recognized its ability to grant relief
not only to individual litigants but also to address systemic threats to the
administration of justice. In Jn re State Bar of Texas, 113 S.W.3d 730 (Tex. 2003),
the Court held that it may exercise its mandamus jurisdiction directly in cases of
compelling importance, bypassing the normal appellate process when necessary to
protect the integrity of the judicial system.

34. Similarly, in Jn re Prudential Ins. Co. of America, 148 S.W.3d 124 (Tex.
2003), the Court abated proceedings to allow reconsideration by a new judge when
the original judge left office, recognizing the importance of procedural regularity
and the need to address changes in judicial assignment. These precedents support
the use of the Myers case as a vehicle for broader systemic review and reform.

V. Conclusion

35. The Myers case, with its sequence of mandamus petitions and
documented procedural breakdowns, is both a symptom and a symbol of the deeper
structural problems afflicting AJR-8. By using Myers as a vehicle for rehearing and
broader inquiry, the Supreme Court of Texas can fulfill its constitutional and
statutory mandate to ensure the fair and efficient administration of justice. This
