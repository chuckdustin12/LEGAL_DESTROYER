Recusal\nprocedures, which have a pedigree as old as recusal itself, create an air of\nmystery and isolation around recusal that is unusual in our judicial system.\nJudges rarely explain their recusal decisions, creating an (often justifiable,\nyet palpable) elusiveness to those decisions that distinguishes them from\nmore traditional orders and opinions. While this should not be enough to\nseriously threaten recusal\u2019s credibility, especially because lower court\njudges do sometimes offer explanations, it adds fuel to an already\nsmoldering fire. Similarly, the fact that judges decide their own recusal\nissues in the first instance promotes skepticism about the integrity of those\ndecisions.

This supports the proposition that if the judge\nand court coordinator's actions were administrative, they would not be\nprotected by judicial immunity.\nThis memo was compiled by Vincent AI based on vLex materials available as\nof September 06, 2025.

Mail and\nwire fraud are the most common predicate acts. ... Under section 1962(c), it\nis a violation to conduct the affairs of an enterprise affecting interstate or\nforeign commerce 'through' a pattern of racketeering activity or through the\nalternative theory of collection of an unlawful debt. To prove a violation of\nSection 1962(c), a plaintiff must prove the following elements: * Existence of\nan enterprise; * The enterprise engaged in, or its activities affected,\ninterstate or foreign commerce; * The defendant was employed by or was\nassociated with the enterprise; * The defendant conducted or participated,\neither directly or indirectly, in the conduct of the affairs of the enterprise;\nand * The defendant participated in the affairs of the enterprise through a\npattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.\nSummary\nRICO allows for civil action against individuals engaged in a pattern of\nracketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.

The passage supports the proposition by\nexplaining that the continuity requirement is met when the predicate acts\npose a threat of continued criminal activity, aligning with the FAC's\nallegations of ongoing risks in the divorce litigation context.\nThis memo was compiled by Vincent AI based on vLex materials available as\nof September 09, 2025.

See id. R. 18a(g). Rule 18a offers no third option whereby a judge\nother than the regional presiding judge can handle matters following recusal. See generally id. R. 18a. Stated otherwise, Rule 18a 'expressly confers the authority\nto reassign a case following a recusal to the regional presiding judge of the administrative judicial district.'\nSummary\nThe passage from \"In re Moore\" clarifies that, according to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a, the authority to reassign a case following a judge's recusal is\nexpressly conferred to the regional presiding judge of the administrative judicial district. There is no provision in Rule 18a that allows for a judge other than the\nregional presiding judge to handle matters following recusal. This implies that the use of a district judge's coordinator in recusal proceedings is not addressed or\npermitted under Rule 18a, as the rule specifically assigns the responsibility to the regional presiding judge.\nIn re Paxton, No. 05-17-00507-CV, No. 05-17-00508-CV, No. 05-17-00509-CV (Tex. App. May 30, 2017)\nTexas Court of Appeals\nExtract\nThus, absent effective application of article 31.09, respondent may not continue to preside over the cases or utilize the services of the court reporter, court\ncoordinator, or clerk of the court of original venue.\nSummary\nWhen a case is transferred to a different venue, the original judge cannot continue to preside over the case or use the services of the court coordinator from the\noriginal venue unless there is consent from the parties involved, as required by article 31.09. This suggests that an administrative judge cannot use the district\njudge's coordinator in recusal proceedings without such consent.\nThis memo was compiled by Vincent AI based on vLex materials available as of May 17, 2025.

Given these recent activities, it is clear that the case is still ongoing and has not yet been closed.\nBackground: The cause of action in this case is a petition for a writ of mandamus, which indicates that the petitioner is seeking a court order to compel a\ngovernment entity or official to perform a duty that is required by law. The factual background is not explicitly detailed in the docket entries; however, the filing of\nthe affidavit and record suggests that the petitioner is relying on specific evidence or documentation to support their request for relief from the court.\nMotion practice: Charles Dustin Myers, designated as the \"Relator,\" filed a petition for writ of mandamus on April 16, 2025, indicating his initiative to compel a\nduty from the respondent, Hon.

The prompt filing of\nan affidavit and record suggests that the necessary documentation was prepared and submitted efficiently, indicating a straightforward procedural approach.\nOverall, the case appears to be relatively simple, focused on compelling a specific action rather than involving complex legal issues or extensive litigation.\nExperts: The docket does not indicate the involvement of any experts in the case, as it primarily consists of filings related to the petition for writ of mandamus\nsubmitted by Charles Dustin Myers.

(36) Notably, a successful plaintiff under [section] 1964 is entitled\nto treble damages and the cost of the suit, including attorney fees. (37) ... In\nHolmes, the Court evaluated the second part of statutory standing under\n[section] 1964(c)--that the injury must be 'by reason of a RICO\nviolation.' (58) ... In Holmes, the Court determined that 'by reason of means\nthat plaintiffs must establish that a defendant's alleged RICO violation\nproximately caused their injuries.' (60)\nSummary\nFor a plaintiff to have standing under RICO, they must demonstrate an injury\nto their business or property caused by a RICO violation. The passage\nexplains that the injury must be \"by reason of\" the RICO violation, meaning\nthere must be a proximate cause linking the violation to the injury.

Then the court with emergency\njurisdiction can only make a temporary order. That temporary order must specify a period reasonably calculated to allow a movant to then seek further orders\nfrom the court that has jurisdiction.\nSummary\nA court with emergency jurisdiction can issue a temporary order, but it must specify a period for seeking further orders from the court with proper jurisdiction. This\nsuggests that while a temporary order can be made, it is not without conditions and must be followed by further proceedings in the appropriate jurisdiction. This\nimplies that a district judge in Texas may have limited jurisdiction to issue temporary orders in emergency situations, but these orders are not final and require\nfurther judicial proceedings.\nMarriage Dissolution\nTexas Small-Firm Practice Tools. Volume 1-2 - James Publishing - Cindy Stormer - 2022-05-05\nExtract\nThe purpose of the hearing is to determine whether, while this case is pending: 1. The preceding temporary restraining order should be made a temporary\ninjunction pending final hearing. 2. The additional temporary injunction prayed for should be granted. 3. Petitioner should be awarded the exclusive use and\npossession of the residence located at [street address, city, state]. [List any other property Petitioner should be exclusively awarded.]\nSummary\nA hearing is required to determine whether temporary orders, such as a temporary injunction or exclusive use of a residence, should be granted while a case is\npending. This suggests that a district judge in Texas would need to hold a hearing to make such determinations, implying that findings and a hearing are\nnecessary before ordering a litigant out of their home or temporarily divesting them of custody.\nThis memo was compiled by Vincent AI based on vLex materials available as of May 17, 2025.

Ordinarily, if the county\nfollows an interchangeable jury system, the jurors are placed on the general\npanel randomly and assigned for service from the top down. But if any party\ndemands a shuffle before the voir dire examination, all the names of the\njurors assigned to that court are reshuffled in a receptacle and reordered\nbased on the shuffle. It is critical that the shuffle is requested before jurors\nare sworn or else the request will not be proper. Only one shuffle is allowed\nper trial in civil trials, while multiple shuffles are allowed in a criminal trial.\nSummary\nIn Texas, a party can invoke their right to a jury shuffle just before the voir\ndire examination. This is applicable under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 223\nfor civil trials and Texas Criminal Procedure Article 35.11 for criminal trials.\nThe request must be made before the jurors are sworn in, and only one\nshuffle is allowed per civil trial, while multiple shuffles are allowed in\ncriminal trials.

It also notes that the trial court can review pleadings and other evidence when considering such a challenge. This is relevant to the question as it outlines\nthe procedural aspect of challenging subject matter jurisdiction, which is applicable in the context of a family law case involving a protective order hearing.\nPlea To The Jurisdiction\nExtract\nAs early as 1893, Texas courts indicated that evidentiary challenges to subject matter jurisdiction raised in pleas to the jurisdiction should be considered by trial\ncourts. And in his Commentaries on the Laws of England, Blackstone lists them as a category of dilatory pleas that (along with pleas of disability and abatement)\ndeny the propriety of the remedy rather than the injury. One hundred years ago, the Texas Supreme Court addressed a variety of matters as pleas to the\njurisdiction, including objections based on personal jurisdiction, subject-matter jurisdiction, dominant jurisdiction, venue, capacity, and conflict of laws.\nSummary\nThe passage provides historical and procedural context for challenging subject matter jurisdiction in Texas courts through a plea to the jurisdiction. It indicates\nthat such challenges have been recognized and considered by Texas courts for over a century. The passage also highlights that pleas to the jurisdiction can\naddress various jurisdictional issues, including subject-matter jurisdiction.\nThis memo was compiled by Vincent AI based on vLex materials available as of June 02, 2025.

While often\ntechnical, this 'distinctiveness' requirement provides that a corporation\ngenerally will not be liable for operating an 'enterprise' consisting of itself\nand its officers or employees. If a business is alleged to have violated RICO\nbased on intracompany actions, then the RICO claim has a good chance of\ndismissal.\nSummary\nThe Tenth Circuit, like other jurisdictions, requires a clear distinction\nbetween the \"person\" and the \"enterprise\" in RICO claims. This\ndistinctiveness requirement is crucial because it prevents a corporation\nfrom being held liable for RICO violations if the alleged enterprise consists\nsolely of the corporation and its officers or employees. This requirement is a\ncommon defense against RICO claims, especially when the alleged violations\nare based on intracompany actions.\nRICO: A Primer\nExtract\nA plaintiff is required to demonstrate that the defendant conducted the\naffairs of an enterprise though a pattern of racketeering activity. The person\nand the enterprise generally must be distinct; but, of course, a Rico person\ncan be a part of an enterprise.\nSummary\nUnder RICO, the person and the enterprise must generally be distinct\nentities. This means that while a RICO person can be part of an enterprise,\nthey cannot be the enterprise itself. This distinction is crucial in RICO cases\nto ensure that the person is not simply the enterprise in disguise, which\nwould undermine the purpose of the statute.\nThis memo was compiled by Vincent AI based on vLex materials available as\nof June 10, 2025.

Volume 1-2 - James Publishing - Scott Brister (Ret.), Dan S. Boyd - 2013-05-05\nExtract\nCourts liberally construe petitions to find a sufficient showing of subject matter jurisdiction. But if the petition affirmatively shows a lack of jurisdiction, the court\u2019s\npower to act cannot be sustained. The petition\u2019s failure to state a jurisdictional amount of damages does not require dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, however,\nunless the pleading affirmatively shows lack of jurisdiction. [Peek v. equipment Service Co., 779 SW2d 802, 804-805 (Tex 1989).]\nSummary\nTexas courts tend to interpret petitions in a way that supports the existence of subject matter jurisdiction. However, if a petition clearly indicates a lack of\njurisdiction, the court cannot proceed with the case. This suggests that if a jurisdictional defect is discovered, and it is clear from the petition that the court lacks\njurisdiction, the case could potentially be dismissed. The passage does not specify a time limit for raising such a defect, implying that it could be raised at any\ntime if it is evident from the petition.\nTexas Courts And Subject Matter Jurisdiction\nExtract\nWhether a trial court has subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law. Subject matter jurisdiction is never presumed and cannot be waived or conferred by\nagreement. And the absence of subject matter jurisdiction can generally be raised at any time and can be raised by a court sua sponte.\nSummary\nSubject matter jurisdiction is a legal question that cannot be waived or conferred by agreement, meaning it is a fundamental requirement for a court to hear a\ncase. Importantly, the absence of subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any time, even after significant proceedings have occurred, and can be initiated by\nthe court itself. This indicates that if a jurisdictional defect is discovered, it can indeed lead to the dismissal of the case regardless of the time elapsed or the stage\nof the proceedings."}

This indicates that if a jurisdictional defect is discovered, it can indeed lead to the dismissal of the case regardless of the time elapsed or the stage\nof the proceedings.\nPlea To The Jurisdiction\nExtract\nIn deciding a plea to the jurisdiction, courts construe the pleadings in the plaintiff's favor and look to the pleader's intent. However, a court may not weigh the\nclaims' merits, but may only consider the plaintiffs' pleadings and the evidence pertinent to the jurisdictional inquiry. If a plaintiff fails to plead facts establishing\njurisdiction, but the petition does not contain incurable defects in jurisdiction, it is a pleading sufficiency issue, and the plaintiff should be allowed the opportunity to\namend. On the other hand, if the pleadings affirmatively negate the existence of jurisdiction, then the plea may be granted without allowing the plaintiff an\nopportunity to amend.\nSummary\nThe passage explains that when a plea to the jurisdiction is raised, the court examines the pleadings to determine if they establish jurisdiction. If the pleadings do\nnot establish jurisdiction but do not contain incurable defects, the plaintiff may be allowed to amend them. However, if the pleadings clearly negate jurisdiction, the\ncase may be dismissed without amendment. This suggests that if a jurisdictional defect is discovered, it could potentially lead to dismissal if it negates jurisdiction.\nThis memo was compiled by Vincent AI based on vLex materials available as of June 01, 2025.

Asserting personal injuries,\nsuch as emotion distress, is insufficient. Second, to prove most types of\nRICO claims, the plaintiff must plead that the defendant committed some\nqualifying criminal action, the most common of which is mail, wire or\nsecurities fraud. Business deals gone sour do not count. Rather, the plaintiff\nmust be able to prove the elements of the asserted crime, and often an\nintent to defraud. If there is nothing criminal in nature about the\ncomplained-of conduct, RICO should not apply. It is an abuse of the RICO\nstatute to attempt to shoehorn ordinary business or contractual disputes\ninto a civil RICO claim. Third, the plaintiff must plead a pattern of\nracketeering activity for most RICO claims. If the alleged conduct occurred\nonce or twice, or was not continuous, it cannot form a pattern of conduct\nsufficient to support a RICO claim. And oftentimes, because there is a fraud\ncomponent, those instances must be particularly identified in the plaintiff's\npleading\u2014a barrier that can prove difficult to accomplish. Fourth, for most\nRICO claims, the plaintiff also must plead that the alleged 'person' and\n'enterprise,' as defined in RICO, are distinct.

In deciding the appeal, a panel of this court\nhas concluded that (1) a case may be remanded from a federal district court to a state trial court without a remand order; (2) the absence of a remand order is a\nprocedural defect that does not affect the state court's jurisdiction to proceed in a case removed to federal district court; and (3) parties may waive the lack of the\nstate court's subject-matter jurisdiction resulting from the failure to satisfy a prerequisite to the revesting of jurisdiction in the state court if the parties participate in\nthe state court proceedings without objecting to the court's lack of jurisdiction.\nSummary\nJurisdictional issues that arise when a case is remanded from federal court to state court. It highlights that a remand order is typically necessary for the state court\nto regain jurisdiction, but parties can waive procedural defects related to jurisdiction if they participate in state court proceedings without objection. This suggests\nthat procedural requirements, such as Rule 237a, may be waived under certain circumstances if the parties do not object.\nThis memo was compiled by Vincent AI based on vLex materials available as of May 09, 2025.

Second, to prove most types of RICO claims, the plaintiff must\nplead that the defendant committed some qualifying criminal action, the\nmost common of which is mail, wire or securities fraud. Business deals gone\nsour do not count. Rather, the plaintiff must be able to prove the elements of\nthe asserted crime, and often an intent to defraud. If there is nothing\ncriminal in nature about the complained-of conduct, RICO should not apply.\nIt is an abuse of the RICO statute to attempt to shoehorn ordinary business\nor contractual disputes into a civil RICO claim.

This doctrine is relevant in the context of civil RICO\nclaims when the federal suit is essentially a collateral attack on a state court\njudgment. The passage highlights the distinction between permissible\ngeneral challenges and impermissible appeals or collateral attacks on state\ncourt judgments.\nThis memo was compiled by Vincent AI based on vLex materials available as\nof September 20, 2025.

The person\nand the enterprise generally must be distinct; but, of course, a Rico person\ncan be a part of an enterprise. A RICO enterprise includes 'any individual,\npartnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or\ngroup of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' Courts\nhave interpreted 'enterprise' broadly, and the definition captures both\nlegitimate and illegitimate enterprises. The statutory list is not exhaustive\nbut merely illustrative. A 'pattern' may exist where any combination of two\nor more offenses occurred within a period of time. In Sedima, S.P.R.L. v.\nImrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, the Supreme Court held that the RICO pattern\nelement requires more than merely proving two predicate acts of\nracketeering. Rather, proof of 'continuity plus relationship' is necessary.\nSummary\nThe passage explains the requirements for establishing a RICO violation\nunder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c), which includes demonstrating that the defendant\nconducted the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering\nactivity. The definition of an enterprise is broad and includes both legitimate\nand illegitimate entities. The passage also clarifies that a pattern of\nracketeering activity requires proof of continuity and relationship between\nthe predicate acts. This supports the proposition that Morgan and Daniel's\ncoordinated actions to execute a fraudulent scheme could be seen as\nconducting the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering\nactivity.\nThis memo was compiled by Vincent AI based on vLex materials available as\nof June 11, 2025.

The intent to deceive the\ncourts and harm Morgan's husband by removing him from the family home\nunder false pretenses aligns with the intent requirement for these predicate\nacts under RICO.\nThis memo was compiled by Vincent AI based on vLex materials available as\nof June 11, 2025.

To the contrary, we hold that, since both statute\nand rule forbid any determination with regard to the recusal motions by\nJudge Howell, the writ must issue, unless Judge Howell promptly enters\neither order permitted to him, i.e. recusal or referral. By his fifteen-page\nbrief, Judge Howell argues that a recusal motion that is procedurally\ninsufficient is not a recusal motion at all, therefore, neither statute nor rule\nis invoked.

This implies that the denial of a recusal\nmotion does not automatically reinstate the original trial judge or relieve the\nvisiting judge. The presiding judge must take specific actions to assign\njudges appropriately. If the regional presiding judge did not properly\nreinstate the trial judge or relieve the visiting judge, and the trial judge set\nthe case for trial sua sponte, it could be considered a procedural error.

Prac. and Rem. Code \u00a7 10.001 Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code \u00a7 10.001 Signing of Pleadings and Motions\nExtract\nThe signing of a pleading or motion as required by the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure constitutes a certificate by the signatory that to the signatory's best\nknowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry: the pleading or motion is not being presented for any improper purpose, including to harass\nor to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation; each claim, defense, or other legal contention in the pleading or motion is warranted\nby existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law; each allegation or other\nfactual contention in the pleading or motion has evidentiary support or, for a specifically identified allegation or factual contention, is likely to have evidentiary\nsupport after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery; and each denial in the pleading or motion of a factual contention is warranted on the\nevidence or, for a specifically identified denial, is reasonably based on a lack of information or belief.\nSummary\nThe signing of a pleading or motion in Texas constitutes a certification by the signatory that the document is not being presented for any improper purpose and\nthat each claim or factual contention has evidentiary support. If the wife knowingly filed false documents and made false claims, she would be in violation of this\nstatute, as her actions would not meet the certification requirements. This supports the proposition that her actions could be considered fraudulent\nmisrepresentation, as they were made with the intent to deceive and could cause harm to another party.\nRelated State Torts\nLitigating Employment Discrimination Cases.

The requirement for a pattern\nof racketeering activity, including continuity and relatedness of acts, is also\naddressed, which is relevant to the timeline of events described.\nRICO: A Primer\nExtract\nThere are four separate and distinct RICO violations set out in section 1962:\n(a) acquiring or operating an enterprise using racketeering proceeds; (b)\ncontrolling an enterprise using racketeering activities; (c) conducting the\naffairs of an enterprise using racketeering activities; and (d) conspiring to so\nacquire, control, or conduct. Each of the subsections incorporates the basic\nelements of 'enterprise' and a 'pattern of racketeering activity.' Section\n1962(c) is, far and away, the most often used and important substantive\nRICO provision. Under section 1962(c), it is a violation to conduct the affairs\nof an enterprise affecting interstate or foreign commerce 'through' a pattern\nof racketeering activity or through the alternative theory of collection of an\nunlawful debt. To prove a violation of Section 1962(c), a plaintiff must prove\nthe following elements: * Existence of an enterprise; * The enterprise\nengaged in, or its activities affected, interstate or foreign commerce; * The\ndefendant was employed by or was associated with the enterprise; * The\ndefendant conducted or participated, either directly or indirectly, in the\nconduct of the affairs of the enterprise; and * The defendant participated in\nthe affairs of the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity or\ncollection of unlawful debt.\nSummary\nElements required to establish a RICO viola"}

Closed-ended continuity is defined as 'a series of\nrelated predicates extending over a substantial period of time.' Open-ended\ncontinuity is defined as conduct that may last only a short period of time but\nnonetheless, poses a threat of extending into the future. The Court\nsuggested a case-by-case examination of this issue, noting that the existence\nof a 'threat of continued racketeering activity' is a function of particular\nfacts.\nSummary\nThe continuity requirement in RICO cases can be satisfied through either\nclosed-ended or open-ended continuity. Closed-ended continuity involves a\nseries of related acts over a substantial period, while open-ended continuity\ninvolves conduct that, although short-lived, poses a future threat. The\ndetermination of continuity is fact-specific and requires a case-by-case\nanalysis. This understanding is crucial in evaluating whether a single\nscheme or single victim scenario can meet the RICO continuity requirement,\nas it emphasizes the potential for future criminal activity rather than the\nnumber of victims or schemes.\nThis memo was compiled by Vincent AI based on vLex materials available as\nof October 25, 2025.

On the other hand, if the pleadings affirmatively negate the existence of jurisdiction, then the plea may be granted without allowing the plaintiff an\nopportunity to amend.\nSummary\nGeneral overview of how courts handle pleas to the jurisdiction in Texas. It explains that courts focus on the pleadings and the intent behind them, rather than the\nmerits of the claims. It also outlines the procedure if a plaintiff fails to establish jurisdiction, indicating that they may be allowed to amend their pleadings unless\nthe pleadings clearly negate jurisdiction.\nTexas Courts And Subject Matter Jurisdiction\nExtract\nSubject-matter jurisdiction concerns a court's power to hear a case. Without it, a court does not have authority to decide a case. Subject matter jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the concept of personal jurisdiction, which involves a court's power to bind a particular party... Whether a trial court has subject matter jurisdiction is a\nquestion of law. Subject matter jurisdiction is never presumed and cannot be waived or conferred by agreement. And the absence of subject matter jurisdiction\ncan generally be raised at any time and can be raised by a court sua sponte. In reviewing a challenge to the court's subject matter jurisdiction, the trial court can\nreview the pleadings and any other evidence relevant to the subject matter jurisdiction issue.\nSummary\nThe passage provides insight into the concept of subject matter jurisdiction in Texas state courts, explaining that it is a question of law and can be challenged at\nany time. This is relevant to filing a plea to the jurisdiction, as such a plea would challenge the court's authority to hear the case based on subject matter\njurisdiction.\nThis memo was compiled by Vincent AI based on vLex materials available as of April 23, 2025.

State sovereign immunity\nencompasses two different types. First, the Eleventh Amendment states that \u201cthe Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit\nin law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or subjects of any Foreign State.\u201d As\ninterpreted by the Supreme Court, \u201can unconsenting State is immune from suits brought in federal courts by her own citizens as well as by citizens of another\nState.\u201d Second, even before the ratification of the Constitution, States enjoyed a broader sovereign immunity that applies against all private suits, whether brought\nin a state or federal court. Neither type of protection is absolute. States may elect to waive either species of immunity in federal or state court. Also, in limited\ncircumstances, Congress can abrogate a state\u2019s sovereign immunity under its enforcement power in section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. The requirements\nfor abrogation and waiver are rigorous. Before Congress can waive a State\u2019s sovereign immunity under the Fourteenth Amendment, it \u201cmust identify conduct\ntransgressing the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s substantive provisions, and must tailor its legislative scheme to remedying or preventing such conduct.\u201d Generally,\ncourts will deem a State to have waived its immunity \u201conly where stated \u2018by the most express language or by such overwhelming implication from the text as [will]\nleave no room for any other reasonable construction.\u2019 \u201d Likewise, in deciding whether Congress has properly abrogated the states\u2019 Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity, courts have required \u201can unequivocal expression of congressional intent to \u2018overturn the constitutionally guaranteed immunity of the several States.\u2019\nSummary\nConcept of state sovereign immunity, which generally protects states from being sued in fed"}

Under the statute, 'racketeering activity' includes a host of\noffenses. ... A 'pattern' may exist where any combination of two or more\noffenses occurred within a period of time. In Sedima, S.P.R.L. v.

In family-law litigation, such\ncriminal conduct can be used for impeachment, sanctions, and referrals; the\ncriminal elements and definitions also inform whether admissions could\nsupport a criminal complaint or influence future credibility and relief (e.g.,\ncustody determinations). The material is criminal-focused and does not set\ncivil family-law standards but provides directly relevant definitions of\ndeceitful conduct relating to property.\nThis memo was compiled by Vincent AI based on vLex materials available as\nof December 12, 2025.
