3. Standing
The law allows me to file this case because I am: (Check one.) 
the mother of the child(ren). 
the “legal father” of the child(ren). An Acknowledgment of Paternity form has been signed and filed 
with the Vital Statistics Unit for each child. A copy of each Acknowledgment of Paternity is attached to 
this Petition.  
a person who has had actual care, control, and possession of the child(ren) for at least 6 months 
ending not more than 90 days before the date this Petition is filed with the Court. I am not a foster 
parent. 
a person who lived with the child(ren) and the child(ren)’s parent, guardian, or managing conservator 
for at least 6 months ending not more than 90 days before the date this Petition is filed with the Court, 
and the child(ren)’s parent, guardian, or managing conservator is now dead.

(Read the law about standing in Texas Family Code Sections 102.003, 102.004 and 102.006) 
4. Jurisdiction
There are no court orders about any of the child(ren). No other Court has continuing jurisdiction over this 
case or the child(ren).  
Texas has authority to decide this case because: (Check one.) 
The children live in Texas now and have lived in Texas for at least the past 6 months or since birth. 
The children do not live in Texas now, but they have been gone from Texas less than 6 months. The 
children had lived in Texas for at least 6 months before they moved. A parent or person acting as a 
parent continues to live in Texas. 
Important: Talk to a lawyer if neither of the above applies. 
Note: If you are the mother or biological father of the child/ren and an Acknowledgment of Paternity form has 
not been signed and filed for each child, you may need to file a paternity case instead of a Suit Affecting the 
Parent-Child Relationship (SAPCR) case. Get information about filing a paternity case at 
www.TexasLawHelp.org. 
Note: If there is already a court order about any of the children, you may need to file a modification case instead
