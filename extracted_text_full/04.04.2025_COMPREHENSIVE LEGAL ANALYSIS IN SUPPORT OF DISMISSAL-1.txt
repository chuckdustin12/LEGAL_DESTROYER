EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This legal analysis examines the case of Charles Dustin Myers ("Respondent") against
Morgan Michelle Myers ("Petitioner") and her attorney Cooper L. Carter. Based on thorough
research of Texas law and the facts presented, there are multiple compelling legal grounds
supporting the Respondent's entitlement to relief for his children and establishing attorney
misconduct by Ms. Carter. This summary was prepared by CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, who is
of sound mind and attests to the validity of all claims, accusations, and statements herein as true

to the best of his knowledge under penalty of perjury.

The analysis concludes that: 
1. The divorce case should be dismissed for want of prosecution due to Petitioner's failure 
to advance the case for nearly a year 
2. The current orders are void due to lack of consent and improper adoption by the referring 
court 
3. The 322nd District Court never acquired continuing exclusive jurisdiction over the 
children 
4. The new SAPCR was properly filed as an original proceeding and should not be 
consolidated, especially considering no motion to transfer has been filed. 
5. Ms. Carter's pleadings should be stricken due to her failure to respond to a Rule 12 
challenge 
6. The children's best interests require immediate relief without further procedural delays 
I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
A. Procedural History 
1. December 18, 2023: Divorce case filed in 322nd District Court with 60-day waiver. 
2. February 6, 2024: Respondent filed emergency motion challenging basis for agreement. 
3. March 14, 2024: Respondent’s motion was denied, basis for agreement became 
temporary orders.

Ul. LEGAL ANALYSIS

A. Dismissal for Want of Prosecution

Legal Framework

1. Texas courts have authority to dismiss cases for want of prosecution under both Texas
Rule of Civil Procedure 165a and the court's inherent power to manage its docket. The Texas
Supreme Court recognized both bases for dismissal in Villarreal v. San Antonio Truck &

Equipment, 994 S.W.2d 628 (Tex. 1999).

2. A party seeking affirmative relief has a duty to prosecute the case with due diligence. 
As stated in In re Conner, 458 S.W.3d 532 (Tex. 2015), “[t]he issue here is whether a trial court 
abuses its discretion by refusing to grant a motion to dismiss for want of prosecution in the face 
of unmitigated and unexplained delay. We hold that it does.” Id. 
3. In family law specifically, In re Marriage of Buster, 115 S.W.3d 141 (Tex. App.—
Texarkana 2003) emphasized the importance of moving family law cases toward resolution and 
upheld dismissal after extended inactivity. 
Application to Current Case 
4. The facts strongly support dismissal for want of prosecution: 
i. 
The divorce case has been pending for over 16 months 
ii. Petitioner's attorney has failed to prosecute the case since April 24, 2024 
iii. No substantive action taken for approximately 11 months 
iv. No responses to discovery, no substantive pleadings, no trial settings 
v. The only recent action was filing a Motion to Consolidate to block emergency 
relief 
5. This extended inactivity is precisely the type of conduct that Texas courts have 
consistently held, which justifies dismissal for want of prosecution. The court should dismiss the 
dormant divorce case and allow the new SAPCR to proceed independently to address the 
children's urgent needs.

B. Void Orders Due to Lack of Consent 
Legal Framework 
6. The Texas Supreme Court established in Burnaman v. Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 
(Tex. 1951) that: "A valid consent judgment cannot be rendered by a court when consent of one 
of the parties is wanting. It is not sufficient to support the judgment that a party's consent thereto 
may at one time have been given; consent must exist at the very moment the court undertakes to 
make the agreement the judgment of the court." 
7. The Court further held: "When a trial court has knowledge that one of the parties to a 
suit does not consent to a judgment, it is error to render a judgment purportedly by agreement; 
such a judgment is a nullity." 
8. This principle was reaffirmed in Padilla v. LaFrance, 907 S.W.2d 454 (Tex. 1995), 
which confirmed that a trial court cannot render an agreed judgment after a party has withdrawn 
consent to a settlement. 
Application to Current Case 
9. The orders in this case are void under Burnaman and its progeny because: 
i. 
The orders claim consent of all parties but only bear signatures of the Petitioner 
and counsel 
ii. Respondent contends he never gave consent to the orders 
iii. Respondent actively opposed the terms that locked him out of his home and 
separated him from the children

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
iv. The court was aware of the dispute regarding consent (Respondent filed an 
emergency motion challenging the basis for agreement) 
10. Under Texas law, if Respondent did not consent to the orders at the time they were 
rendered, they are void ab initio. The court should declare these orders void and vacate them. 
C. Associate Judge's Orders Never Properly Adopted 
Legal Framework 
11. Texas Family Code § 201.013(b) explicitly states: "Except as provided by Section 
201.007 (Powers of Associate Judge), if a request for a de novo hearing before the referring court 
is not timely filed, the proposed order or judgment of the associate judge becomes the order or 
judgment of the referring court only on the referring court's signing the proposed order or 
judgment." 
12. This requirement is mandatory, not discretionary. Without the District Judge's 
signature, the Associate Judge's order remains merely a "proposed" order. 
Application to Current Case 
13. The orders in this case were issued by an Associate Judge but allegedly never 
properly adopted or signed by the referring District Court. Under Texas Family Code § 
201.013(b), these orders never achieved the status of a final judgment of the court and have no 
legal effect as final orders. 
14. This defect alone would be sufficient to challenge their validity, even without the 
consent issues. The court should declare these orders void or vacate them due to the lack of 
proper adoption by the referring court.

D. No Continuing Exclusive Jurisdiction (CEJ) 
Legal Framework 
15. Texas Family Code § 155.001(a) provides: "A court acquires continuing, exclusive 
jurisdiction over the matters provided for by this title in connection with a child on the rendition 
of a final order." 
16. Critically, § 155.001(d) states: "Unless a final order has been rendered by a court of 
continuing, exclusive jurisdiction, a subsequent suit shall be commenced as an original 
proceeding." 
17. In In re Burk, 252 S.W.3d 736 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2008), the court held 
that CEJ is established only upon rendition of a final order, and temporary orders do not establish 
CEJ. 
Application to Current Case 
18. No final order was ever rendered in the divorce case because: 
i. 
The Associate Judge's orders were never properly signed by the referring District 
Court Judge (per § 201.013(b)) 
ii. The orders were void due to lack of consent (per Burnaman v. Heaton) 
19. Without a final order, the 322nd District Court never acquired CEJ over the children. 
Therefore, under § 155.001(d), the Respondent's new SAPCR was properly "commenced as an 
original proceeding" in the 233rd District Court. 
20. The motion to consolidate should be denied because the 322nd District Court does 
not have dominant jurisdiction over the children.

E. Exceptions to Dominant Jurisdiction 
Legal Framework 
           21. Generally, when two suits involving the same subject matter are pending in different 
courts of equal jurisdiction, the court in which the suit was first filed has dominant jurisdiction. 
However, the Texas Supreme Court in Wyatt v. Shaw Plumbing Co., 760 S.W.2d 245, 247 (Tex. 
1988) recognized three exceptions to this rule: 
i. Conduct by a party that estops them from asserting prior active jurisdiction 
ii. Lack of persons to be joined if feasible 
iii. Lack of intent to prosecute the first lawsuit 
Application to Current Case 
         22. Even if the 322nd District Court had dominant jurisdiction (which it does not due to 
lack of CEJ), at least two exceptions to the first-filed rule apply: 
Estoppel by Conduct: 
i. 
Petitioner allowed the case to become completely dormant 
ii. Failed to comply with Rule 237a's notice requirements after federal remand 
iii. Effectively concealed the revival of the state case 
iv. Represented through inaction that she had abandoned the case 
     
Lack of Intent to Prosecute: 
i. 
For nearly a year, Petitioner took no action to advance the divorce

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
ii. No discovery, no responses, no settings 
iii. Only "revived" the divorce case as a strategic ploy to derail Respondent's 
emergency action 
23. The 233rd District Court is the appropriate forum to hear the current disputes because 
that case was initiated specifically to address the children's urgent needs, free from the 
entanglements of the stalled divorce. 
F. Attorney Misconduct - Rule 12 Challenge 
Legal Framework 
24. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12 provides that a party may file a sworn motion 
stating that they believe a suit is being prosecuted or defended without authority. The challenged 
attorney bears the burden of proving authority to act. If the attorney fails to show authority, the 
court "shall refuse to permit the attorney to appear in the cause and shall strike the pleadings if 
no person who is authorized to prosecute or defend appears." 
25. These consequences are mandatory, not discretionary. The court has no choice but to 
bar the attorney and strike the pleadings upon failure to show authority. 
Application to Current Case 
26. Respondent filed a verified Rule 12 motion on September 20, 2024, challenging 
Cooper L. Carter's authority. Ms. Carter has not responded to this challenge for over 6 months. 
Additional facts supporting the Rule 12 challenge include: 
i. 
Ms. Carter's e-filing account is registered under her prior employer's email 
address

Discovery Violations 
28. Ms. Carter failed to respond to Requests for Admissions served on September 17,

effort to withdraw or amend these deemed admissions, effectively conceding critical facts against 
her client.

Rule 237a Violations 
30. After federal remand on December 6, 2024, Ms. Carter failed to: 
i. 
File the required certified copy of the remand order with the clerk 
ii. Provide Respondent with mandatory written notice of the remand 
31. This procedural violation prevents the case from moving forward properly and further 
demonstrates Ms. Carter's neglect of basic procedural duties. 
Abuse of Process 
31. Ms. Carter's sudden reappearance after nearly a year of inactivity solely to block 
emergency relief suggests improper purpose. Filing a Motion to Consolidate without addressing 
substantive issues appears designed to delay resolution rather than advance the case. 
This conduct violates: 
i. 
Rule 13 of Texas Rules of Civil Procedure (forbidding groundless filings brought 
in bad faith) 
ii. Texas Disciplinary Rule 3.02 (prohibiting positions that unreasonably delay 
resolution) 
H. Children's Best Interests 
Legal Framework 
32. Texas Family Code § 153.002 establishes: "The best interest of the child shall be the 
primary consideration of the court in determining the issues of conservatorship and possession of 
and access to the child."

This paramount standard must guide all decisions in cases involving children. 
Application to Current Case 
33. The children in this case are suffering ongoing harm: 
i. 
Subjected to psychological manipulation and medical neglect 
ii. Left home alone at night without supervision 
iii. Removed from Respondent's care and placed with elderly great-grandparents 
iv. Eldest child's academic performance has plummeted 
v. Emotionally estranged from both parents 
34. Every day that passes without corrective action leaves the children in an unstable, 
harmful environment. Consolidation would reward procedural stonewalling and cause further 
delay. The children's best interests require prompt resolution, which can only be achieved by 
denying consolidation, dismissing the dormant divorce case, and allowing the new SAPCR to 
proceed expeditiously. 
III. CONCLUSION AND RELIEF REQUESTED 
Based on the comprehensive legal analysis above, there are multiple independent grounds 
supporting the Respondent's entitlement to relief: 
1. The divorce case should be dismissed for want of prosecution under Rule 165a and the 
court's inherent power. 
2. The current orders are void due to lack of consent under Burnaman v. Heaton.
