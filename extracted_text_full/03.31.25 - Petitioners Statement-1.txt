4. This places the obligation on COOPER L. CARTER to file with the clerk of the state 
court a certified notice of remand, which she has failed to do as of March 31, 2025, nearly three 
months later. 
5. COOPER L. CARTER’s authority to represent MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS has been in 
question since September 20, 2024, in cause number 322-744263-23 and is similarly in question in the 
instant case. 
6. COOPER L. CARTER has never filed a pleading on MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS’ behalf 
in either this court or the 322nd district court since she was allegedly retained on January 22, 2024, in her 
individual capacity over fourteen months ago. 
7. RODERICK D. MARX has filed every pleading on behalf of COOPER L. CARTER in both 
this matter and the divorce matter. 
8. RODERICK D. MARX has not made an appearance or otherwise been named as a party in 
either suit.

which has been pointed out several times by Petitioner. Exhibit 3 
13. The 322nd District Court of Tarrant County does not have continuous exclusive

15. Without any submissions from Respondent since April 24, 2024, COOPER L. 
CARTER suddenly submits pleadings to this court claiming bad faith and answers with a general

25. The Associate Judge disagreed and refused to hear the emergency TRO. 
26. At the close of business on March 28, 2025, nothing was ever filed with the 322nd 
District Court by COOPER L. CARTER. 
27. Petitioner and the children in this suit were denied due process outright despite being 
correct in his legal position. 
28. Petitioner’s detriment to his position is the fact that he is self-represented. 
29. Respondent’s detriment to her position is the lack of prosecution or defense. 
II. ARGUMENT 
30. When it comes to remand, the obligation falls on the plaintiff to file with the state 
court a certified copy of the order of remand. TEX. R. CIV. P. 237a; see also Kashan v. McLane 
Co., NO. 03-11-00125-CV, 7 (Tex. App. Jun. 7, 2012) (holding that rule 237a’s notice 
requirements cannot be satisfied by the district court, but must come from the plaintiff.)  
 
31. This prevents any trial on the merits, and prevents any relief to the Petitioner and his 
children.  
 
32. All other facts supported by evidence have already been provided to COOPER L. 
CARTER yet continues to not engage and instead call in favors from the bench.  
 
III. CONCLUSION 
Petitioner traveled to this court with a prepared emergency supported by exhibits only to 
be turned away at the eleventh hour due to his self-represented status and in the face of no real 
opposition. The children were denied due process outright, and now have been left without a 
remedy. The proper course of action should have been to hear the TRO and put in place 
protections for the minor children pending any promises of consolidation.

court a certified copy of the order of remand. TEX. R. CIV. P. 237a; see also Kashan v. McLane

31. This prevents any trial on the merits, and prevents any relief to the Petitioner and his

32. All other facts supported by evidence have already been provided to COOPER L.

CARTER yet continues to not engage and instead call in favors from the bench.

Il. CONCLUSION
Petitioner traveled to this court with a prepared emergency supported by exhibits only to
be turned away at the eleventh hour due to his self-represented status and in the face of no real

The above statement of facts, unless promptly rebutted by COOPER L. CARTER, warrant 
immediate relief as duly requested in the emergency TRO through a declaratory judgement, and this court 
should proceed with the hearing date originally set for April 10th, 2025, and the emergency TRO should be 
GRANTED without further delay. 
COOPER L. CARTER disrupted much needed relief for the minor children in this case with false 
promises delivered to the tribunal that directly undermined the Petitioner’s due process rights. COOPER L. 
CARTER is fully aware that she cannot file anything in 322nd District Court because in doing so she would 
be acting ultra vires.   
Petitioner reasserts his position that COOPER L. CARTER is acting without authority, has no 
ability to comply with 237a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and cannot explain how she is able to 
abandon a case for nearly a full calendar year, yet can suddenly show up to defend her alleged client before 
this court for the sole purpose to prevent Petitioner’s emergency TRO from being heard, which was 
permitted despite being told he could present the motion. In what sense is this appropriate when children 
are involved? Does the attorney’s license give her a free pass to thwart the rules and litigate in bad faith? 
It may be a needle in the haystack, but this case defies the initial presumption that pro-se litigants 
are not as equipped or as capable as licensed attorneys, and it is no fault of COOPER L. CARTER. The 
Petitioner reminds the court that the true culprit responsible for this circumstance remains the puppet master 
hiding in the background – the Respondent – and yet Petitioner wishes no harm to her because this litigation 
is about the children. The children need their mother, but they also need their father.  
Perhaps the zealous passion has been misunderstood for contempt by the tribunal, but Petitioner’s 
motive runs parallel to that set forth in the Texas Family Code. However, despite the procedural quagmire, 
the anomalies, the pro-se status, the solution remains simple:  
Grant the relief. Nobody has argued against it, Texas law demands it, and the best interests of the 
Children depend on it. There remains no logical or legal basis to give COOPER L. CARTER any further 
deference in the face of Petitioner’s self-represented status. Petitioner welcomes any response from

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
COOPER L. CARTER to the contrary. If such response were to be filed, it would be the first in over fourteen 
months of litigation. 
If approached from a logical standpoint, the situation can be interpreted as such: 
i. 
COOPER L. CARTER is shackled by Rule 12 and Rule 237a of the 
Texas Rules of Civil Procedure from reaching final trial. 
ii. 
The 322nd District Court is shackled from proceeding due to Cooper 
L. Carter’s failure to prosecute. 
iii. 
The Petitioner is shackled from his home, his children’s daily lives, 
and his place of business under facially void orders that claim 
consent. 
iv. 
Most critically, the children are shackled in a situation that is not in 
their best interests and continue to suffer irreparable harm without 
any opportunity for relief and without any lawful basis. 
Indeed, that leaves just one party un-chained from this situation:  
the Respondent. Petitioner rests his case. 
IV. PRAYER 
WHEREFORE promises considered, the Petitioner, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, 
requests the following expedited relief: 
1. Take judicial knowledge that COOPER L. CARTER disrupted an emergency in 
bad faith and failed to fulfill her promise. 
2. Grant the emergency TRO without delay and keep the original hearing date set 
for April 10th as agreed by the parties on March 28th, 2025.  
3. Give no further deference to attorney COOPER L. CARTER, who has not 
prosecuted nor defended her position, and require a written response.
