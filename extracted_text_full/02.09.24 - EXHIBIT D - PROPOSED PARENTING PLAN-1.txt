EXHIBIT A: TEMPORARY VISITATION ADJUSTMENT PROPOSAL

Respondent: Charles Dustin Myers

Understanding the intricate nature of our family's current situation and the legal complexities involved, |,
Charles Dustin Myers, propose a thoughtful adjustment to the visitation schedule that aligns with our
cohabiting status and the abrupt changes brought about by the divorce announcement.

1. Co-habitation Acknowledgement:

It is acknowledged that both parents currently cohabit, which com plicates traditional custody
arrangements. Therefore, the immediate priority is to facilitate a transition where both parties can
establish their respective independent living and working arrangements without disrupting the children's
lives.

2. Transition Period:

Morgan's Employment: Provide Morgan with the necessary support and time to secure stable
employment, which is vital for her to contribute to the children's needs and establish her own residence.

Stable Housing for Charles: As | seek stable housing to maintain my significant role in our daughters'
lives, flexibility in visitation is essential to ensure | continue to fulfill my parental duties.

3. Work and Research Commitments:

The concurrent legal proceedings, particularly those based on unverified clai ms, demand a substantial
amount of my time for research and preparation to protect the children's wel I-being.

My ability to work has been affected by the proceedings, necessitating an adjustment in my day-to-day
routine to accommodate these new responsibilities.

4. Interim Custody Logic:

Continuity for Children: While we navigate these proceedings, it is critical to maintain stability and
continuity for our children. Any temporary custody arrangements should reflect the least disruptive path
for them.

Counseling and Mediation: | strongly advocate for counseling or mediation to reconcile and navigate the
divorce process, emphasizing the children's best interests rather than abrupt and contentious changes.

5. Court's Facilitation:

The court's facilitation in endorsing a temporary and flexible visitation framework is crucial. This
framework must account for the current living situation and the significant emotional and logistical
upheaval that the divorce proceedings have caused.

This proposal is made in the spirit of cooperation, with a focus on minimizing the impact of our marital
dissolution on our children. It is with a sincere hope that we can transition into a stable co-parenting
arrangement that keeps our children's welfare as the priority.

Respectfully submitted,

Charles Dustin Myers
