I am of sound mind and capable of making this statement. I have personal knowledge of

criminally responsible. This statement is true and correct. 
I'm signing this affidavit to attest to the work ethic and 
dedication of Charles Myers. I've come to rely on the 
services he provides in order to gather the required data to 
make educated decisions on what and when to enter/exit 
options positions. Recently due to him not being at his 
normal location of operations the services have had multiple 
down times in which Charles was not in a position to be able 
to remedy. Some of these down times have led to significant 
losses due to making decisions without the necessary data 
after already being entered in a position.

I'm signing this affidavit to attest to the work ethic and
dedication of Charles Myers. l've come to rely on the
services he provides in order to gather the required data to

make educated decisions on what and when to enter/exit

options positions. Recently due to him not being at his

normal location of operations the services have had multiple
down times in which Charles was not in a position to be able
to remedy. Some of these down times have led to significant

losses due to making decisions without the necessary data

Charles' work ethic is unlike anything I've seen in anyone 
I've ever met and he does everything for the future of his 
family. I'm constantly amazed at the feats he is able to pull 
off as a one man show. Some things he is able to create 
I didn't think were possible but he figures it out through 
his endless research and personal development efforts. 
Again, everything I've seen him do, he does to give his 
girls the best life he can and wants the world for them. 
I've seen videos of him with his children out at many 
different parks/recreational areas and I can tell that they 
love their father to death and that he would die for them. 
I hope his situation is resolved for not only my benefit but 
for the sakes of his children and the life he is trying to 
provide them with. Charles Myers is both a good person and 
amazing father and I would hate to see him and his daughters 
robbed of the life he is building that they need and deserve.
