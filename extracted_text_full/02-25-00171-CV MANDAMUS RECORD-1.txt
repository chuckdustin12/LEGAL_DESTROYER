Re: Original Petition in Suit Affecting Parent-Child Relationship (“SAPCR”) – Request to 
File as Separate Case and Set Immediate Hearing (In the Interest of [M.M.] and [C.M.], 
minor children; related to Cause No. 322-744263-23, In re Marriage of Myers) 
Dear Mr. Wilder and Honorable Court: 
Please accept for filing the enclosed Original SAPCR concerning the above-referenced 
children. This SAPCR is intentionally filed as a new, separate case, rather than under the 
existing divorce cause, due to unique procedural defects in that divorce proceeding that have left 
the children in legal and physical limbo. Immediate intervention is required to protect the 
children’s best interests. Below, I outline the compelling reasons – supported by law and the 
record – why this SAPCR must proceed separately and be set for an emergency hearing at 
once, instead of being merged into the stalled divorce case. 
A. Failure of Opposing Party to Prosecute
1. The divorce Petitioner has wholly failed to prosecute the divorce, leaving it in
procedural limbo. Over a year has passed with no meaningful activity toward a final resolution. 
Notably, after the divorce case was removed to federal court and later remanded, Petitioner 
never filed the required certified Order of Remand or gave notice of remand as mandated by 
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 237a. Rule 237a obligates the removing party to promptly file the 
federal remand order with the state clerk and notify all parties, after which any defendant has 15 
days to answer. Petitioner’s omission of this required step has left the state court record 
incomplete and the case procedurally suspended. Indeed, due to Petitioner’s inaction (and her

minor children; related to Cause No. 322-744263-23, In re Marriage of Myers)

Dear Mr. Wilder and Honorable Court:

Please accept for filing the enclosed Original SAPCR concerning the above-referenced
children. This SAPCR is intentionally filed as a new, separate case, rather than under the
existing divorce cause, due to unique procedural defects in that divorce proceeding that have left
the children in legal and physical limbo. Immediate intervention is required to protect the
children’s best interests. Below, I outline the compelling reasons — supported by law and the
record — why this SAPCR must proceed separately and be set for an emergency hearing at

once, instead of being merged into the stalled divorce case.
A. Failure of Opposing Party to Prosecute

1. The divorce Petitioner has wholly failed to prosecute the divorce, leaving it in
procedural limbo. Over a year has passed with no meaningful activity toward a final resolution.
Notably, after the divorce case was removed to federal court and later remanded, Petitioner
never filed the required certified Order of Remand or gave notice of remand as mandated by
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 237a. Rule 237a obligates the removing party to promptly file the
federal remand order with the state clerk and notify all parties, after which any defendant has 15
days to answer. Petitioner’s omission of this required step has left the state court record

incomplete and the case procedurally suspended. Indeed, due to Petitioner’s inaction (and her

MR 1.1

=== PAGE 7 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
counsel’s apparent inability to e-file; see Point 8 below), no remand notice was ever filed, so 
the divorce court has not resumed jurisdiction in any practical sense. 
2. In addition, Petitioner has ignored the Texas Supreme Court’s time standards for
timely disposition of cases. A divorce case is expected to be resolved within 12 months, yet 
Petitioner has made no effort to advance it. She has not set a trial or even a status conference; she 
has allowed critical deadlines to lapse. This lack of diligence violates the duty to prosecute one’s 
claims and warrants dismissal for want of prosecution. In fact, Respondent has been forced to 
file a Motion to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution (pending before the Court) detailing 
Petitioner’s complete failure to move the case forward. This also remains un-responded to. 
Petitioner’s inaction has left the family with no active forum to address urgent child-related 
issues. Therefore, a separate SAPCR is necessary to provide a functioning vehicle for relief. 
The children cannot wait for the Petitioner’s indifference or strategic delay to abate. 
B. Failure to Oppose Any Relief (Legal Concession)
3. Throughout the divorce case, Petitioner has not opposed or responded to any of
Respondent’s filings, motions, or claims for relief. She and her counsel have remained silent in 
the face of serious allegations and requests, effectively conceding the merits of those issues 
under Texas law. Respondent has raised grave claims of fraud, perjury, deception, and child 
neglect against Petitioner in his pleadings, yet Petitioner’s counsel has filed no response or 
defense to these claims. Respondent also served discovery and Requests for Admissions which 
went completely unanswered, resulting in deemed admissions. He even filed a motion to 
compel discovery, which Petitioner again did not oppose, though unfortunately no hearing has 
yet been held. Moreover, when Respondent moved for other interim relief (including return to 
the family home and expanded access to the children), Petitioner filed no opposition. By her

inaction, Petitioner has implicitly admitted the validity of Respondent’s factual assertions and 
the justness of his requests.  
4. Texas law is clear that a party who fails to respond to motions or claims effectively
waives any objection and accepts the movant’s evidence as true. For example, in the 
summary judgment context, if a nonmovant files no response, the court may accept the movant’s 
asserted facts as uncontroverted and render judgment if entitlement is shown; issues not timely 
raised in a written response are waived; see Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c). The same principle applies 
here: Petitioner’s total failure to contest Respondent’s filings is tantamount to a legal concession 
of those matters. In other words, failure to make timely and specific objections results in waiver 
of the objections. See Clark v. Trailways, Inc., 774 S.W.2d 644, 647 (Tex. 1989), cert. denied, 
493 U.S. 1074, 110 S.Ct. 1122, 107 L.Ed.2d 1028 (1990); Hartford Accident and Indem. Co. v. 
McCardell, 369 S.W.2d 331, 335 (Tex. 1963); Srite v. Owens-Illinois, Inc., 870 S.W.2d 556, 565 
(Tex.App. — Houston [1st Dist.] 1993), revised on other grounds, 897 S.W.2d 765). Courts have 
recognized that a party’s failure to respond indicates a belief that the motion has merit.  
5. Petitioner’s silence speaks volumes. She has never disputed that Respondent should be
allowed to return home or see his children – in fact, she has not opposed any relief requested. 
This silence should be treated as acquiescence. Accordingly, there is no reason to keep the 
children waiting in the paralytic divorce case when no one is even arguing against the relief 
Respondent seeks in this SAPCR. The SAPCR can and should proceed on the uncontroverted 
facts in Respondent’s filings.

6. Every day that passes with the children separated from their father is a day of
irreparable harm. The undisputed evidence is that the children are suffering due to 
Respondent’s forced absence from the home. In the months since he was excluded, the children’s 
well-being has precipitously declined: they have fallen behind in school, missed critical medical 
and dental appointments, and have been emotionally traumatized by the sudden and prolonged 
separation from their father. No party—not even Petitioner—has asserted that the children would 
be anything but better off if their father could return to care for them. No one has argued against 
Respondent’s return to the home or his involvement in the children’s daily life. It is axiomatic 
that the best interest of the children is the paramount concern in any case affecting the parent-
child relationship. See Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002 (mandating that “[t]he best interest of the 
child shall always be the primary consideration of the court in determining the issues of 
conservatorship and possession of and access to the child”); Lenz v. Lenz, 79 S.W.3d 10, 14 
(Tex. 2002) (emphasizing that courts must place “predominant emphasis” on what best serves the 
children's welfare, particularly focusing on stability, emotional and educational needs, and 
maintaining frequent contact with fit parents). 
7. The Texas Legislature explicitly prioritized children’s best interests in all
conservatorship and possession determinations: “The best interest of the child shall always be 
the primary consideration of the court in determining the issues of conservatorship and 
possession of and access to the child.” Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002. Texas Supreme Court 
jurisprudence confirms and expands upon this legislative directive, instructing courts to consider 
stability, educational continuity, emotional health, and ongoing relationships with fit parents in 
their best-interest analysis. See Lenz, 79 S.W.3d at 14–15 (holding courts must evaluate what

will best serve the child’s overall welfare, ensuring a stable and emotionally supportive 
environment and maintaining meaningful and frequent parental contact). 
8. Here, it is unquestionably in the children's best interests to have their loving father
back in their daily lives without further delay. Texas public policy explicitly states that children 
should have frequent and continuing contact with parents who have demonstrated the ability to 
act in their best interest. See Tex. Fam. Code § 153.001(a) (declaring the public policy of 
Texas to ensure frequent contact and shared duties between parents and children following 
separation); Lenz, 79 S.W.3d at 14–15 (affirming that Texas policy favors maintaining 
frequent and meaningful parental involvement in a child's life). 
9. Respondent has demonstrated throughout these proceedings that he is a caring, fit
parent whose presence provides the children with stability, support for their education and health, 
and emotional security. By contrast, the children’s current situation—living apart from 
Respondent for no substantiated reason—is destabilizing and harmful. Texas courts recognize the 
urgency of child custody matters and have repeatedly underscored that “justice demands a 
speedy resolution of child custody and child support issues.” In re Tex. Dep’t of Fam. & 
Protective Servs., 210 S.W.3d 609, 613 (Tex. 2006) (orig. proceeding) (quoting Proffer v. 
Yates, 734 S.W.2d 673, 674 (Tex. 1987)). Simply put, the children’s needs cannot wait on 
procedural formalities or a dormant divorce case. Their welfare requires this SAPCR to be heard 
immediately so that orders can be promptly put in place to reunite them with their father and 
address their academic, emotional, and medical needs. No statute or rule forbids initiating a 
separate SAPCR when it is necessary to protect children's best interests. Indeed, Tex. Fam. Code 
§ 153.002 and the overarching equitable duty of the Court compel swift action here. Respondent
is ready, willing, and able to resume caring for his children, and no party has objected to him

doing so. Therefore, the Court must accept this SAPCR and schedule an immediate hearing to 
serve the children's best interests without further delay. See Lenz, 79 S.W.3d at 14–15 (holding 
courts must prioritize swift judicial actions in custody matters, protecting the best interests of 
children). 
D. Fraud and Perjury Render the Prior Orders Void
10. The orders entered in the divorce case that currently keep Respondent out of the home
and away from the children were obtained through fraud, misrepresentation, and even 
perjury. Because those orders were procured by wrongful means, they are void ab initio and 
cannot be permitted to stand in the way of this SAPCR. Texas law does not tolerate court orders 
obtained by trickery or false pretenses. Notably, the temporary orders in the divorce (signed 
January 16, 2024 and later on March 14, 2024) were presented to the Court as “agreed” orders, 
yet Respondent never agreed to them and never signed them. In fact, Respondent had 
expressly opposed the relief in those orders. The “agreement” was a fiction created by 
Petitioner’s counsel. The record reflects that Petitioner’s counsel drafted and submitted those 
orders without Respondent’s consent or signature, and which reference a hearing not found on 
the docket. This is a textbook example of a fraud on the court. A judgment or order entered as 
“agreed” when one party actually objected is void. The Texas Supreme Court’s holding in 
Burnaman v. Heaton is directly on point: when a trial court knows a party does not consent to a 
purported agreed judgment, it must refuse to sign it; any judgment rendered under such 
circumstances “is void.” Burnaman v. Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 (Tex. 1951). 
11. Here, the court was misled – it was never disclosed that Respondent vehemently
disagreed. Without such consent the judgment is void. The law will not give effect to a 
“party’s consent” that was never actually given. Moreover, the way those orders were obtained

doing so. Therefore, the Court must accept this SAPCR and schedule an immediate hearing to
serve the children's best interests without further delay. See Lenz, 79 S.W.3d at 14-15 (holding
courts must prioritize swift judicial actions in custody matters, protecting the best interests of

children).
D. Fraud and Perjury Render the Prior Orders Void

10. The orders entered in the divorce case that currently keep Respondent out of the home
and away from the children were obtained through fraud, misrepresentation, and even
perjury. Because those orders were procured by wrongful means, they are void ab initio and
cannot be permitted to stand in the way of this SAPCR. Texas law does not tolerate court orders
obtained by trickery or false pretenses. Notably, the temporary orders in the divorce (signed
January 16, 2024 and later on March 14, 2024) were presented to the Court as “agreed” orders,
yet Respondent never agreed to them and never signed them. In fact, Respondent had
expressly opposed the relief in those orders. The “agreement” was a fiction created by
Petitioner’s counsel. The record reflects that Petitioner’s counsel drafted and submitted those
orders without Respondent’s consent or signature, and which reference a hearing not found on
the docket. This is a textbook example of a fraud on the court. A judgment or order entered as
“agreed” when one party actually objected is void. The Texas Supreme Court’s holding in
Burnaman v. Heaton is directly on point: when a trial court knows a party does not consent to a
purported agreed judgment, it must refuse to sign it; any judgment rendered under such

circumstances “is void.” Burnaman v. Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 (Tex. 1951).

11. Here, the court was misled — it was never disclosed that Respondent vehemently
disagreed. Without such consent the judgment is void. The law will not give effect to a

“party’s consent” that was never actually given. Moreover, the way those orders were obtained

MR 1.6

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
was rife with material falsehoods. In her filings, Petitioner knowingly made false statements to 
the Court to justify excluding Respondent from the home. For example, in her Application for 
Protective Order and supporting affidavit, Petitioner grossly misrepresented the facts, painting 
Respondent as a danger without evidence. She alleged incidents that never occurred or twisted 
mundane events into false claims of “family violence.” These misrepresentations were later 
exposed, and Petitioner has never attempted to prove them in any evidentiary hearing. 
Petitioner’s intent was plainly to deceive the Court into granting her sole occupancy of the home 
and custody of the children. Indeed, Respondent’s pending Motion to Dismiss details how 
Petitioner “knowingly made and presented fraudulent claims to the Court regarding 
Respondent’s property, with the intent to deprive him of his interest in his home”, and how 
she acted with intent that “these false claims be given the same legal effect as valid court orders, 
misleading the Court and causing Respondent to be wrongfully deprived of his home and 
livelihood.” 
12. These strong findings, which stand uncontroverted, show that the prior orders were
procured by fraud and deception. Under longstanding Texas precedent, any order obtained by 
extrinsic fraud (fraud that effectively prevents a fair presentation of the case) is void and a 
nullity. See King Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman, 118 S.W.3d 742, 751–52 (Tex. 2003) (judgment 
obtained by fraud can be set aside; only extrinsic fraud – such as keeping a party away from 
court or concealing critical facts – justifies relief).  
13. Here, Petitioner’s fraud was extrinsic in that it kept Respondent from participating
fully (the “agreed” order ploy) and kept the Court from learning the true facts. A litigant who 
lies to gain advantage in a court order subverts the process; the resulting order lacks integrity 
and is void.

14. In sum, the prior temporary orders that ousted Respondent were built on a
foundation of fraud. They should carry no weight and pose no obstacle to granting relief in this 
new SAPCR. This Court not only has the authority to declare such orders void, it has a duty to 
do so in order to prevent manifest injusticec. See Burnaman, 240 S.W.2d at 291. By proceeding 
with a fresh SAPCR, the Court can consider the issues regarding the children de novo, on truthful 
evidence, untainted by the false premises of the earlier orders. Equity regards as done that which 
ought to have been done – the Court should restore Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, 
(Petitioner in the new cause) to his rightful place in the home and children’s lives, as if the 
fraudulent orders had never been entered. 
E. Restoring the True Status Quo of the Family
15. Relief in this SAPCR is also warranted to restore the status quo that existed before
Petitioner’s improper actions. The “last actual, peaceable status quo” in this family was 
Respondent living in the home with the children, as a present and active father. That was the 
reality until late 2023, when Petitioner – through unilateral false allegations – removed 
Respondent from the household. Texas law holds that the purpose of temporary orders and 
injunctive relief is to maintain or restore the status quo pending trial. See In re Shifflet, 462 
S.W.3d 528, 537 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2015, orig. proceeding) (courts aim to restore 
the last peaceable status quo pending final trial). 
16. Here, the true status quo ante was the intact family unit with Respondent present.
The situation now – Respondent barred from the home and children – is a drastic deviation from 
that status quo, achieved only by contested court orders that, as shown, lack validity. Every day 
that Respondent is kept out is a day the family’s natural equilibrium is disturbed further.

Texas courts have intervened in analogous situations to return to the rightful status quo. For 
example, when one party’s unilateral conduct disrupts a long-standing living arrangement, courts 
recognize that stability must be restored for the benefit of all, especially the children. See Smith 
v. McDaniel, 842 S.W.2d 7, 12 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1992, no writ) (courts should preserve or
restore the conditions that existed prior to the controversy to protect the children’s routine and 
sense of security). Here, restoring the status quo means allowing Respondent back into his 
home and parenting role immediately. That was the “last peaceable” situation before litigation 
– a state in which the children were thriving. Notably, the findings in the temporary orders
hearing (held without Respondent) even indicate there were no findings of any imminent harm if 
Respondent were present; the exclusion was based solely on Petitioner’s requested relief, not on 
proven misconduct by Respondent.  
17. Thus, there is no safety-based reason to maintain the current deviation from the norm.
By contrast, there are powerful reasons to return to normalcy: the children’s suffering would be 
alleviated, and the family’s balance and stability would be reestablished. 
18. In short, equity demands that we “undo” the improper disruption caused by
Petitioner’s actions. This SAPCR allows the Court to do exactly that – to realign temporary 
orders with reality and justice. In re Shifflet instructs that the last peaceable status quo should 
be restored pending trial. The last peaceable status was Respondent in the home; restoring that 
will harm no one (again, even Petitioner did not claim any abuse or violence requiring exclusion 
– her application acknowledged no recent violence, only vague fears). Maintaining the current
situation, by contrast, gravely harms the children and prejudices Respondent’s relationship with 
them. Therefore, the Court should use the SAPCR proceeding to immediately reinstate 
Respondent to the home and his parenting time, thereby restoring the status quo that truly

this Court can and should correct now. 
F. The Court’s Duty to Act Without Delay for the Children’s Welfare
19. By accepting this SAPCR as a separate case, the Court can fulfill its paramount duty
to protect the children’s welfare without procedural delay. Courts have a sacred obligation 
to put the interests of children above rigid procedural considerations, especially in emergencies. 
The Texas Supreme Court has emphasized that trial courts must act immediately when 
children’s physical or emotional well-being is at stake, even if procedural complexities exist. 
In In re Tex. Department of Family & Protective Services, for example, the Supreme Court 
admonished that delays in custody matters are intolerable, quoting with approval the maxim: 
“Justice demands a speedy resolution of child custody and child support issues.” 210 S.W.3d 
609, 613 (Tex. 2006). The high court in that case (a mandamus proceeding) required prompt 
action despite procedural entanglements, recognizing that a child’s need for a stable, safe 
environment cannot be made to wait on protracted litigation maneuvers. 
20. Similarly, in Elizondo v. Monteleone, an appellate court noted that when a parent
attempted procedural gambits to delay a custody determination, the court system should not 
allow those tactics to trump the child’s immediate needs. Elizondo v. Monteleone, 96 S.W.3d 705, 
708 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2002, no pet.) (courts will not permit jurisdictional technicalities 
to delay emergency relief in a parent-child case). [(If citation is verified)] In that case, one party 
tried to remove the case to federal court and argued that the state court lacked jurisdiction to 
issue temporary orders during the interim. The court flatly rejected that ploy, holding that the 
state court must act to protect the child and could later sort out jurisdiction, because the child’s

welfare was paramount. The lesson is clear: procedural fencing cannot override the need for 
immediate judicial action when children are suffering. 
21. Here, Petitioner’s inaction and the snares of the divorce case have already delayed
relief for far too long. The children have been without their father for several critical months of 
their development. The Court has the power—and indeed the duty—to cut through the 
procedural morass by creating a new SAPCR docket and promptly addressing the merits of 
conservatorship, possession, and access. There is no jurisdictional barrier to doing so: this Court 
has continuing jurisdiction over the children (by virtue of the ongoing divorce) and thus can hear 
a SAPCR involving them. Any concern about duplicitous litigation is mitigated by the fact that 
the divorce case is effectively moribund; furthermore, Respondent will move to consolidate or 
dismiss the divorce once the SAPCR is in place, if appropriate. What cannot be allowed is more 
delay that leaves the children in a fractured situation. Our Courts are courts of equity as well 
as law, especially in family matters. When equity demands immediate intervention, the Court 
should not hesitate. As the Austin Court of Appeals observed, “when the jurisdiction of the court 
has been properly invoked in matters affecting minor children, the court’s primary consideration 
is the best interest of the children, and the court may enter any order deemed necessary to 
protect and conserve the welfare of the child.” Elizondo, 96 S.W.3d at 708 (citing Tex. Fam. 
Code § 105.001 on temporary orders for a child). In other words, once the Court is aware of a 
child in need, it must act, and act swiftly.  
22. That is precisely the situation here. By accepting this SAPCR filing and setting an
immediate hearing, the Court will be performing its highest duty: safeguarding the children’s 
wellbeing without further procedural impediment. Conversely, to refuse the SAPCR or to delay

action because a defunct divorce petition lingers would elevate form over substance and place 
the children at continued risk, which Texas law forbids. 
23. In sum, this Court is empowered and required to provide a forum for immediate
relief, and the SAPCR is the proper mechanism to do so. The Court should therefore promptly 
docket this SAPCR as a new case and schedule an emergency hearing on temporary orders for 
the children. 
G. Protective-Order Application Confirms Respondent’s Joint Ownership of the Home
24. Even Petitioner’s own filings acknowledge Respondent’s legal right to return to the
residence. In her sworn Application for Protective Order (filed in September 2023), Petitioner 
explicitly affirmed that the marital residence “is jointly owned or leased by the Applicant and 
Respondent.” 
25. This judicial admission is significant. It means that at the time she sought exclusive
use of the home, Petitioner conceded that Respondent is co-owner (or co-leaseholder) of the 
property. There is no dispute, therefore, that Respondent has an equal property interest and 
legal right to occupy the home. Petitioner cannot now contradict her own sworn statement by 
suggesting Respondent has no such right. 
26. Why is this important? Because the prior orders granting Petitioner exclusive
possession of the home (and excluding Respondent) stand in direct conflict with the parties’ 
property rights and the status quo. Those orders were based not on any finding that Respondent 
lacked ownership or rights to the home, but presumably on a temporary need for protection 
(which, as shown, was falsely claimed). With the exposure of Petitioner’s allegations as false, 
there remains no lawful basis to keep Respondent out of a home that he owns jointly. Texas

Family Code § 153.003 states that the Court cannot condition a parent’s possession of a child on 
the payment of support or other matters unrelated to the child – likewise, the Court should not 
condition Respondent’s access to his home (and thereby to his children) on a procedurally flawed 
prior order, especially when Petitioner herself admits the home is community property. The 
protective order application further underscores that Petitioner’s sole claim to the home was 
through a temporary court order, not any independent right. When the predicate for that 
temporary order (alleged family violence) is unproven and disputed, the underlying property 
rights must prevail. 
27. In equity, where two parties have equal right to possession of a property, one cannot
exclude the other absent a valid court order supported by good cause. Here, absent the now-
questionable temporary orders, Respondent as joint owner would be free to live in his home. The 
Court should thus give weight to Petitioner’s admission of joint ownership and recognize 
Respondent’s unabated property right. This is yet another reason to allow the SAPCR to go 
forward: so that the issue of residency and possession of the home can be revisited in light of the 
true facts and rights of the parties. The protective order was leveraged into a settlement which 
both parties did not agree to (as the record will show, if needed), meaning no long-term 
restrictions were found warranted. What remains is a fit father who co-owns his home seeking to 
return to his necessity to work and provide financially for the children. Petitioner’s own 
pleadings remove any doubt about his entitlement. Accordingly, the Clerk and Court should not 
hesitate to facilitate Respondent’s return via new temporary orders in this SAPCR, as even 
Petitioner’s sworn statements support Respondent’s position.

H. Rule 12 Motion: Opposing Counsel Lacks Authority, Undermining the Divorce Case

MR 1.13

=== PAGE 19 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Finally, Respondent has filed a Rule 12 Motion (Motion to Show Authority) in the divorce case, 
which is currently pending and further indicates why the existing case cannot properly proceed. 
In that motion (filed September 20, 2024), Respondent challenged the authority of Petitioner’s 
attorney of record to act on her behalf.  
28. This challenge was not made lightly – it is supported by evidence that Petitioner’s
counsel never filed the pleadings, is not authorized to practice in this matter under her current 
registration, and may not even have a valid engagement with Petitioner. Notably, since that 
motion was filed, Petitioner’s counsel has failed to respond to it or otherwise prove her 
authority. Rule 12 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provides that an attorney challenged by 
such a motion must appear and show authority to act for the client, or else be struck from the 
case. Petitioner’s counsel has not met this burden. Instead, irregularities have abounded: at a 
recent hearing (on Respondent’s motion to recuse), Petitioner’s counsel appeared without 
having answered the Rule 12 motion, and the Court allowed her to argue on a motion she did 
not respond to, but her authority remains in question.. Moreover, it came to light that Petitioner’s 
counsel has been unable to e-file pleadings on her client’s behalf because her electronic filing 
account is in disarray (registered under a former employer’s email at Cantey Hanger yet is 
signing pleadings for Marx, Altman, & Johnson) . In fact, the few documents “filed” in the 
divorce case on Petitioner’s side were filed by Roderick Marx, not by the attorney herself. And 
tellingly, Petitioner’s counsel failed to file the Notice of Remand after the federal court sent the 
case back, leaving the case hanging indefinitely. All of this demonstrates that Petitioner’s counsel 
is effectively not acting with proper authority or competence in the divorce matter.

MR 1.14
--- OCR TEXT ---
Finally, Respondent has filed a Rule 12 Motion (Motion to Show Authority) in the divorce case,
which is currently pending and further indicates why the existing case cannot properly proceed.
In that motion (filed September 20, 2024), Respondent challenged the authority of Petitioner’s

attorney of record to act on her behalf.

28. This challenge was not made lightly — it is supported by evidence that Petitioner’s
counsel never filed the pleadings, is not authorized to practice in this matter under her current
registration, and may not even have a valid engagement with Petitioner. Notably, since that
motion was filed, Petitioner’s counsel has failed to respond to it or otherwise prove her
authority. Rule 12 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provides that an attorney challenged by
such a motion must appear and show authority to act for the client, or else be struck from the
case. Petitioner’s counsel has not met this burden. Instead, irregularities have abounded: at a
recent hearing (on Respondent’s motion to recuse), Petitioner’s counsel appeared without
having answered the Rule 12 motion, and the Court allowed her to argue on a motion she did
not respond to, but her authority remains in question.. Moreover, it came to light that Petitioner’s
counsel has been unable to e-file pleadings on her client’s behalf because her electronic filing
account is in disarray (registered under a former employer’s email at Cantey Hanger yet is
signing pleadings for Marx, Altman, & Johnson) . In fact, the few documents “filed” in the
divorce case on Petitioner’s side were filed by Roderick Marx, not by the attorney herself. And
tellingly, Petitioner’s counsel failed to file the Notice of Remand after the federal court sent the
case back, leaving the case hanging indefinitely. All of this demonstrates that Petitioner’s counsel

is effectively not acting with proper authority or competence in the divorce matter.

29. This is critical because if Petitioner’s attorney lacks authority, then Petitioner is

essentially unrepresented in the divorce. Her pleadings (including the Original Petition for

Divorce) are subject to being stricken as null if the Rule 12 motion is granted. The entire divorce 
proceeding would be a nullity without an authorized petitioner or counsel – which is another 
reason it has stagnated. It would be unjust to make the children wait for months while this issue 
is sorted out. By contrast, in a new SAPCR, Petitioner can secure proper counsel or proceed pro 
se, but the Rule 12 quagmire in the divorce case can be sidestepped for now to get the children 
relief. The pending Rule 12 motion underscores that the divorce case is on unstable footing. It 
is procedurally snarled by questions of representation. On the other hand, Respondent is ready to 
proceed in the SAPCR immediately – he, as the petitioner in the SAPCR, obviously has 
authority to bring it, and he will serve Petitioner directly. If Petitioner’s prior counsel truly has no 
authority, Petitioner will have to either hire new counsel or represent herself in responding to the 
SAPCR, but at least the case will move forward. The Rule 12 fiasco in the divorce should not be 
allowed to delay relief for the children. Equity again favors moving to a forum (the SAPCR) 
where all parties before the Court are indisputably authorized and the merits can be reached 
without distraction. 
30. In summary on this point, Respondent’s Rule 12 motion (which remains unanswered)
indicates that the opposing attorney “has no authority to act for the party” – a situation which, 
by rule, would mandate striking her pleadings and possibly dismissing the divorce. Rather than 
let the case devolve into that chaos (to the children’s detriment), the Court should start fresh with 
this SAPCR. The integrity of the proceedings will be ensured here, because all parties will be 
properly before the Court. Respondent is confident that once this SAPCR is active, Petitioner 
will either appear on her own or with legitimate counsel and the issues can finally be adjudicated 
on the merits. Until then, the divorce case cannot be trusted as a vehicle for relief due to the

cloud over Petitioner’s representation. This factor strongly supports accepting the SAPCR as a 
standalone action and granting the requested hearing and relief without delay. 
I. Conclusion
31. For all the foregoing reasons – lack of prosecution in the divorce, Petitioner’s waiver
of opposition, the children’s urgent needs, the void nature of prior orders, the necessity of 
restoring the status quo, and procedural snares in the divorce case – Respondent respectfully 
urges the Clerk to file the enclosed SAPCR as a new cause of action, and requests that the 
Court set an immediate EX-PARTE hearing on temporary orders in this SAPCR to issue 
injunctive relief immediately allowing access back into the residency and children’s lives. 
The Court has abundant legal justification and equitable grounds to do so. Most importantly, the 
children’s welfare compels immediate action, and the Petitioner will not be adversely 
affected by this decision, and has immediate housing options nearby available to her, 
contrary to the undersigned. Every factor discussed above converges on one truth: these 
children need their father back and need a stable, working court order to govern their custody 
and care – and they need it now, not months from now. By allowing this SAPCR to proceed 
separately, the Court will cut the Gordian knot that the divorce case has become and will be able 
to issue orders truly serving the children’s best interests forthwith. 
32. Respondent is prepared to appear for an emergency hearing on any date and time the
Court can accommodate – preferably today. He is also prepared to file any additional supporting 
documents or evidence the Court may require. All necessary filing fees for this SAPCR are being 
paid, and service of process will be promptly effected on the opposing party. We ask only that the 
Clerk accept this filing (rather than reject or re-route it to the old cause) and that the Court 
immediately calendar the case for a hearing at the earliest possible date. If there are any

3. Standing
The law allows me to file this case because | am: (Check one.)
[_] the mother of the child(ren).

[@) the “legal father” of the child(ren). An Acknowledgment of Paternity form has been signed and filed
with the Vital Statistics Unit for each child. A copy of each Acknowledgment of Paternity is attached to
this Petition.

[_] a person who has had actual care, control, and possession of the child(ren) for at least 6 months
ending not more than 90 days before the date this Petition is filed with the Court. | am not a foster
parent.

L_] a person who lived with the child(ren) and the child(ren)’s parent, guardian, or managing conservator
for at least 6 months ending not more than 90 days before the date this Petition is filed with the Court,
and the child(ren)’s parent, guardian, or managing conservator is now dead.

[_] the grandparent, great-grandparent, sister, brother, aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew of the child(ren)
and: (Check the box below that applies to your case.)

[_] both parents are dead.
L_] both parents, the surviving parent, or managing conservator agree to me filing this case.

[_] the child(ren)’s present circumstances will significantly impair (harm) the child(ren)’s physical
health or emotional development.

L] other:
(Read the law about standing in Texas Family Code Sections 102.003, 102.004 and 102.006)

Note: If you are the mother or biological father of the child/ren and an Acknowledgment of Paternity form has
not been signed and filed for each child, you may need to file a paternity case instead of a Suit Affecting the

Parent-Child Relationship (SAPCR) case. Get information about filing a paternity case at
www. TexasLawHelp.org.

4. Jurisdiction

There are no court orders about any of the child(ren). No other Court has continuing jurisdiction over this
case or the child(ren).

Texas has authority to decide this case because: (Check one.)
[™) The children live in Texas now and have lived in Texas for at least the past 6 months or since birth.

[_] The children do not live in Texas now, but they have been gone from Texas less than 6 months. The
children had lived in Texas for at least 6 months before they moved. A parent or person acting as a
parent continues to live in Texas.

Important: Talk to a lawyer if neither of the above applies.

Note: If there is already a court order about any of the children, you may need to file a modification case instead

of a Suit Affecting the Parent-Child Relationship (SAPCR) case. Get information about filing a modification case
at www. TexasLawHelp.org.

TEXAS 
I. PARTIES AND JURISDICTION
A. Petitioner and Next Friend
1. Charles Dustin Myers (“Petitioner”) is the father of two minor children,
M.E.M., aged eight, C.R.M., aged five, (“the Children”). The Children are under 18 and
have no court-appointed guardian in this matter. Petitioner brings this suit as Next Friend 
of the Children pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 44, which permits minors 
without a legal guardian to sue through a next friend. Petitioner also brings claims in his 
individual capacity as the Children’s biological father. 
2. Petitioner notes that related cause number 322-744263-23, a suit for the
dissolution of marriage, is procedurally stalled with the Respondent named in the instant 
case, Morgan Michelle Myers, being unable to prosecute her case. The current orders in 
the related divorce matter, reflect facially void orders that claim all parties agree, yet they

were rendered without the consent of both parties on March 14, 2024. Thus, the orders 
have no legal effect, and the children have no legally effectuated managing conservator 
despite being under the court’s continuous jurisdiction. Therefore, Petitioner’s initiation 
of this suit on behalf of the minor children, M.E.M and C.R.M. as Next Friend to restore 
their status quo is appropriate and aligns with their best interests, Texas State policy, and 
the Texas Family Code. 
B. Respondent Morgan Michelle Myers
3. Respondent Morgan Michelle Myers (“Morgan” or “Defendant”) is an
individual residing in Tarrant County, Texas. She is the mother of the Children and 
Petitioner’s spouse. Morgan may be served with process at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, 
Texas 76148, which is the matrimonial home. 
C. Third Party Defendant Dan Branthoover
4. Defendant Dan Branthoover is an individual who resides in Yukon, Oklahoma.
Branthoover is a relative of Morgan who, as detailed below, assisted her in the wrongful 
acts against Petitioner and the Children. Once liability is established, Branthoover is 
subject to personal jurisdiction in Texas under the Texas long-arm statute because he 
committed tortious acts in whole or in part in Texas that give rise to this suit. 
Specifically, Branthoover actively aided Morgan’s fraudulent court filings and 
interference with the Petitioner’s parental rights in Texas, causing injury in Texas, and 
thus “committed a tort in whole or in part in this state” per Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code 
§ 17.042(2). He may be served pursuant to Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 17.044 by
serving the Texas Secretary of State, or by any other method authorized by law, as his

of this suit on behalf of the minor children, M.E.M and C.R.M. as Next Friend to restore
their status quo is appropriate and aligns with their best interests, Texas State policy, and

the Texas Family Code.
B. Respondent Morgan Michelle Myers

3. Respondent Morgan Michelle Myers (“Morgan” or “Defendant’’) is an
individual residing in Tarrant County, Texas. She is the mother of the Children and

Petitioner’s spouse. Morgan may be served with process at ee.

Texas a. which is the matrimonial home.
C. Third Party Defendant Dan Branthoover

4. Defendant Dan Branthoover is an individual who resides in Yukon, Oklahoma.
Branthoover is a relative of Morgan who, as detailed below, assisted her in the wrongful
acts against Petitioner and the Children. Once liability is established, Branthoover is
subject to personal jurisdiction in Texas under the Texas long-arm statute because he
committed tortious acts in whole or in part in Texas that give rise to this suit.
Specifically, Branthoover actively aided Morgan’s fraudulent court filings and
interference with the Petitioner’s parental rights in Texas, causing injury in Texas, and
thus “committed a tort in whole or in part in this state” per Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code
§ 17.042(2). He may be served pursuant to Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 17.044 by

serving the Texas Secretary of State, or by any other method authorized by law, as his

acts constitute doing business in Texas. Petitioner will move to include Branthoover as a 
party to this matter when procedurally appropriate. 
D. Jurisdiction
5. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this cause. The amount in
controversy exceeds the minimum jurisdictional limits of this Court. More importantly, 
the Court has jurisdiction under Texas Family Code § 42.002, which expressly 
authorizes a civil action for interference with possessory interests in a child. The Court 
also has jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief to protect the best interests of the Children, 
as this suit directly impacts the parent-child relationship. Petitioner further invokes this 
Court’s equitable power to remedy fraud on the court and to protect the welfare of minor 
children. 
E. Venue
6. Venue is proper in Tarrant County, Texas. The Children reside in Tarrant
County, and Defendant Morgan resides in Tarrant County. Many of the wrongful acts 
occurred in Tarrant County (including fraudulent filings in the 322nd District Court of 
Tarrant County). Here, a related Suit Affecting the Parent-Child Relationship (the divorce 
and custody proceeding) is pending in Tarrant County (Cause No. 322-744263-23 in the 
322nd Judicial District). Filing in this venue serves the interests of justice and efficiency. 
F. Standing and Capacity
7. Petitioner, as the Children’s biological father and Next Friend, is authorized to
bring claims on their behalf. He has a justiciable interest in the custody and well-being 
of the Children. The Children have standing through Petitioner to seek relief for the

harms they have suffered due to Respondent’s conduct. Petitioner also has standing on 
behalf of his children and in his own right to seek redress for the violation of his parental 
rights and the personal damage he sustained leading to emotional conflict for the children 
and himself. 
II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Morgan Michelle Myers, Respondent and Danielle Kenneth Branthoover, Defendant, are 
collectively referred to as “Defendants”. 
G. Summary of the Dispute
8. This case arises from an unprecedented and unjust separation of a father from
his children through fraud and deception upon the courts. On January 16, 2024, the 
322nd District Court of Tarrant County signed an order that ousted Petitioner from his 
own home and effectively removed him from the Children’s lives. To this day, that 
drastic removal remains unexplained and unjustified, as it was procured by Defendant 
Morgan’s false filings and has never been meaningfully examined. Petitioner was given 
no real opportunity to be heard before losing daily contact with his Children. Over a year 
has passed, yet no court has rectified or even addressed the glaring fraud and 
inconsistencies underlying the orders that separated a loving father from his kids without 
cause. 
H. Texas Policy Favors Both Parents’ Involvement
9. From the outset, it must be emphasized that Texas public policy “assure[s] that
children will have frequent and continuing contact with parents who have shown the 
ability to act in the best interest of the child.” (Tex. Fam. Code § 153.001(a)(1)). The

law further provides that “the best interest of the child shall always be the primary 
consideration” in matters of possession and access (Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002). 
Petitioner has always acted in the Children’s best interests, as evidenced by his role as 
their primary caregiver and provider prior to court intervention. Yet Defendants’ actions 
have flipped Texas policy on its head – rather than frequent contact with both parents, the 
Children have been limited to one parent’s custody for over a year, with the other parent 
(Petitioner) effectively erased from their daily lives. This lawsuit seeks to restore the 
status quo ante in line with Texas law and the Children’s best interests. 
I. Background – The Marriage and Children
10. Petitioner and Respondent Morgan were married for eight years and are the
parents of two minor Children (ages 6 and 8). Prior to the events in question, Petitioner 
was a devoted father and the primary caregiver to the Children. He was also the 
family’s primary breadwinner, ensuring financial stability for the household. The family 
lived together at their home in Watauga, Texas. The Children enjoyed a loving 
relationship with Petitioner, who was deeply involved in their daily routine, care, and 
upbringing. There had been no history of family violence or court intervention during the 
full scope of the marriage. 
J. Morgan’s Sudden Change of Heart and Secret Preparations
11. In early December 2023, without warning, Morgan informed Petitioner that
she wanted a divorce. Her initial stated reasons were trivial (complaints about how 
Petitioner talked to her), but soon she began condemning the entire marriage, even 
memories she once cherished. Unbeknownst to Petitioner at the time, Morgan was

already engaged in extramarital relationships with at least two individuals outside the 
marriage: Debbie Price and Damen Kazlauskas. On or around December 12, 2023, 
Petitioner discovered phone records showing an enormous volume of communication 
(over 16,500 text messages) between Morgan and these individuals. Confronted with the 
likely exposure of her infidelity and concerned about its implications, Morgan began 
frantically plotting to remove Petitioner from the picture. Her goal, as evidenced by 
her actions, was to lock Petitioner out of the marital home, isolate him from the 
Children, and shield her own wrongdoing from scrutiny. 
K. Fraudulent and Ex Parte Court Filings (December 2023)
12. Between December 14 and December 22, 2023, Morgan – with active help from
Defendant Branthoover – made a series of rushed court filings in the 322nd District 
Court designed to obtain an upper hand through deceit. These filings were calculated to 
portray Petitioner as an absent or dangerous spouse and to deprive him of notice or a 
chance to defend himself. In rapid succession, Morgan filed: 
•
a. False “Uncontested Case” Representation: On or about December 18, 2023,
Morgan submitted a document (for review by a court attorney) falsely indicating
that the case was “uncontested,” implying Petitioner had agreed or would not
fight. Exhibit 1

this was a ploy to mislead the court into quicker relief.

~$400 filing fee for the divorce, asserting that she had only $20 to her name and 
that the Children “relied solely on her income”. Exhibit 2 
14. This statement was a knowing falsehood. In truth, Petitioner was the primary
financial provider for the family, and Morgan had access to substantial funds. In fact, just 
days before, on December 16, 2023, Morgan (with Branthoover’s guidance) transferred 
$1,576.00 in joint marital funds into a new personal bank account under her control 
using Branthoover’s PayPal as a method to obscure her banking information. Morgan 
admitted in text messages with Branthoover that she moved these funds, and bank records 
later confirmed it. Thus, at the time she swore she was penniless, she was in possession 
of significant community assets. She also grossly misrepresented her expenses in that 
affidavit – claiming she alone paid the mortgage/rent and car loans – when in fact 
Petitioner had been paying those bills and continued to pay them. (Notably, one of the 
vehicles Petitioner was paying for has been repossessed by the dealer due to financial 
hardship.) These glaring contradictions in Morgan’s pauper’s affidavit demonstrate 
perjury and fraud upon the court. Exhibit 3. 
Morgan’s divorce case should never have even been docketed without fees, given her 
deceit.

family violence was in place (apparently to invoke a 60-day waiting period waiver 
for divorce). Exhibit 4 
15. Both cannot be true; this inconsistency should have been a red flag. Furthermore,
if an active protective order truly existed, Texas law (Tex. Fam. Code § 6.405(b)) 
required Morgan to attach a copy of it to her petition. She attached no such order, 
because none existed – the “active” protective order was a fiction. In short, Morgan was 
telling the court whatever was convenient at the moment, truth be damned. 
•
d. Application for Protective Order (Second Attempt): On December 22, 2023,
Morgan filed yet another request – an Application for a Protective Order – in the
322nd District Court. Exhibit 5
16. This was perplexing, since just four days earlier she had implied she already had a
protective order. The second application underscores that Morgan was “bent on 
amassing multiple orders” against Petitioner without justification. The Application was 
based on allegations of “family violence” by Petitioner, but no credible evidence was 
ever presented to support such claims. On the very day this second application was filed 
(Dec. 22), Morgan and Petitioner were photographed laughing and playing with the 
Children together in the family home – hardly the behavior of someone in imminent 
fear for her safety. Morgan’s own contemporaneous text messages and photos show a 
normal, even happy, family scene that day. This directly contradicts her sworn claims 
that she needed protection from Petitioner.  Exhibit 5.1

17. Defendant Branthoover (Morgan’s relative) played a pivotal role in this
scheme. Immediately after Morgan’s first filing on Dec. 14, she traveled to Yukon, 
Oklahoma – Branthoover’s location – where he “assisted her in preparing subsequent 
filings designed to achieve the very result we see today—Respondent’s abrupt 
removal from his home.”. Branthoover’s assistance is confirmed by his own admissions 
via text and is the basis of a pending lawsuit against him in Oklahoma for his role in this 
fraud. Exhibit 6 In essence, Branthoover acted as a co-conspirator, helping Morgan craft 
and present false evidence to Texas courts. He had actual knowledge of Morgan’s plans 
and the falsehoods in her filings, yet actively furthered them. Under Texas law, one who 
aids or assists in the interference with another’s possessory rights in a child is jointly 
liable for the damages caused (Tex. Fam. Code § 42.003). Branthoover’s liability in this 
action flows from his knowing aid in Morgan’s tortious conduct. 
M. “Agreed” Temporary Orders
18. Making matters worse, Morgan’s counsel allegedly retained on the spot
drafted “Temporary Orders” following the January 22 reset in related case 322-744263-
23, which purported to memorialize an agreement or hearing that never truly occurred 
and is not found within the docket sheet. These Temporary Orders claim that all parties 
“agreed” to the terms – yet Petitioner never agreed to any such orders, and his signature 
is absent from such. The court cannot legally enforce temporary orders that claim to be 
agreed when consent is absent at the time of rendition. Such is the case here, and they 
should be immediately vacated. Exhibit 7

Orders is Morgan’s and her counsel’s; Petitioner’s signature is absent. The orders also 
reference a motion that was never served on Petitioner. This is clear procedural 
irregularity. These “agreed” Temporary Orders, entered on false pretenses, gave Morgan 
temporary custody of the Children and possession of the home, while barring Petitioner 
from both. By any measure, such orders – obtained without notice, without a genuine 
hearing, and predicated on false statements of agreement – lack validity. They are void 
ab initio and cannot stand as a barrier to the relief Petitioner seeks here. Morgan’s misuse 
of the court’s processes to rubber-stamp an unjust arrangement is part and parcel of her 
tortious conduct. 
N. Morgan’s Abdication of the Truth and Procedure
20. After securing the Temporary Orders, Morgan and her attorney effectively
went dark and stonewalled the litigation. They refused to participate in discovery, 
ignored deposition notices, and generally failed to prosecute the divorce on the merits. 
Tellingly, neither Morgan nor her counsel has ever filed any substantive response to 
Petitioner’s numerous sworn allegations of fraud in the pending case. They offered no 
rebuttal to the detailed factual record Petitioner built demonstrating Morgan’s deceit. 
Morgan’s silence in the face of these accusations is deafening – she could not defend the 
indefensible. Instead, her counsel’s rare court appearances were limited to raising 
baseless objections aimed at preventing Petitioner from cross-examining Morgan or 
exposing the truth. This strategy of “obfuscation and evasion” underscores that Morgan 
has no legitimate defense for her actions; her plan was simply to run out the clock 
while Petitioner remained in forced exile from his Children.

21. The impact of Defendants’ actions has been devastating and continues to
worsen. Petitioner lost his family, his home, and even his livelihood as a direct result of 
the fraudulent orders. Being evicted from his home without notice not only separated him 
from the Children, but also disrupted his business/employment, causing severe financial 
strain. The family’s previously stable finances have been thrown into chaos. Petitioner 
has incurred substantial expenses fighting these false accusations and attempting to 
reunite with his Children. He has suffered extreme emotional distress, detailed further 
below, from the traumatic loss of his role as father and daily caregiver. 
22. The Children have likewise suffered immensely. They went from having a
loving father present each day to suddenly no contact at all, effectively overnight. This 
abrupt, unexplained loss of a parent’s daily presence has caused the Children profound 
confusion, anxiety, and emotional pain. They were too young to understand why their 
father vanished from their lives. Family members (including Morgan’s own relatives) 
have struggled to explain the situation to the Children, because the truth – that it was all 
based on lies – was concealed. Instead, the Children have been left with the impression 
that their father “went away” or did something wrong, which is untrue and damaging to 
their mental well-being. The Children have essentially been deprived of a parent’s love, 
guidance, and support for over a year through no fault of their own.Moreover, during 
this period, Morgan has introduced a new man (Defendant Kazlauskas) into the 
Children’s lives, spending substantial time with him and even allowing him to take the 
Children places alone. The Children now see this stranger more often than their own 
father.

reunite with his Children. He has suffered extreme emotional distress, detailed further

below, from the traumatic loss of his role as father and daily caregiver.

22. The Children have likewise suffered immensely. They went from having a
loving father present each day to suddenly no contact at all, effectively overnight. This
abrupt, unexplained loss of a parent’s daily presence has caused the Children profound
confusion, anxiety, and emotional pain. They were too young to understand why their
father vanished from their lives. Family members (including Morgan’s own relatives)
have struggled to explain the situation to the Children, because the truth — that it was all
based on lies — was concealed. Instead, the Children have been left with the impression
that their father “went away” or did something wrong, which is untrue and damaging to
their mental well-being. The Children have essentially been deprived of a parent’s love,
guidance, and support for over a year through no fault of their own.Moreover, during
this period, Morgan has introduced a new man (Defendant Kazlauskas) into the
Children’s lives, spending substantial time with him and even allowing him to take the
Children places alone. The Children now see this stranger more often than their own

father.

23. This is exactly the kind of harmful disruption in a child’s life that Texas law
seeks to prevent. Texas law prioritizes frequent, meaningful contact between children 
and both parents, yet the Children’s reality is the opposite. As the Texas Supreme Court 
has recognized, children depend on “the positive benefits flowing from parental love, 
affection, protection, emotional support, services, companionship, care, and society” from 
both parents. Defendants have callously stripped the Children of these benefits from 
Petitioner. 
24. In sum, Morgan’s fraudulent actions, aided by Branthoover, have caused
unprecedented and ongoing harm. Petitioner was the primary caregiver and a fit, 
loving parent. There was no legitimate reason to remove him. Yet due to Defendants’ 
tortious conduct, the Children have effectively lost a parent for over a year, and 
Petitioner has lost irreplaceable time with his kids. This is a human tragedy as much as a 
legal wrong. The facts are largely undisputed – Morgan has never rebutted the evidence 
of her lies – and the need for relief is urgent. Every day that passes is another day of 
childhood the Children can never get back with their father. 
25. That being said – Petitioner wishes no ill will toward any Defendant or
participant in this suit – he simply wants what’s right by his children in alignment with 
Texas law.

26. Interference with Possessory Rights: Petitioner incorporates the facts above.
Texas law expressly forbids one parent (or any person) from wrongfully depriving 
another parent of his court-ordered possessory rights with respect to a child. Under Texas 
Family Code § 42.002, “a person who takes or retains possession of a child or who 
conceals the whereabouts of a child in violation of a possessory right of another 
person may be liable for damages to that person.” 
27. A “possessory right” defined in the Family Code includes a court-ordered
right of possession or access, as well as a parent’s natural and statutory rights absent a 
valid court order to the contrary. Here, Petitioner had possessory rights to his Children 
both as a matter of law (being their father with equal rights during the marriage) and 
under any prior court understanding. Defendants intentionally interfered with and 
violated Petitioner’s possessory rights by orchestrating and enforcing a situation in 
which Petitioner has been excluded from the Children’s lives. 
28. Morgan’s Direct Interference: Morgan took and retained sole possession of
the Children at a time when Petitioner was entitled to joint possession and access on 
March 6th, 2024, Morgan acted without lawful excuse in keeping the Children away 
from Petitioner by locking him out of his own house. She violated the fundamental 
possessory right of Petitioner to have access to his Children. Each day that she refused to 
produce the Children to Petitioner, she was in ongoing violation of Petitioner’s rights. 
Notably, Texas law makes it a crime to knowingly violate a custody order or to keep 
children away from a legal custodian (Tex. Penal Code § 25.03), underscoring the public 
policy against such interference. Morgan’s conduct here is even more egregious because 
she herself engineered the void order on which she then relied.

29. Branthoover’s Aiding and Abetting: Pursuant to Texas Family Code
§ 42.003, “a person who aids or assists in conduct for which a cause of action is
authorized by this chapter is jointly and severally liable” 
Branthoover aided and assisted Morgan’s interference with Petitioner’s possessory rights 
at every step. He helped draft the false pleadings that led to Petitioner’s removal. He had 
actual notice that Petitioner had rights to possession of the Children and knew that the 
intended result of the filings was to cut off those rights. Thus, Branthoover is jointly 
liable for the tortious interference with Petitioner’s parental rights and custody. 
30. Elements and Malice: Defendants’ conduct was willful and intentional.
Morgan’s objective from the moment she realized her infidelity might be exposed was to 
willfully deprive Petitioner of possession of the Children to protect herself. She 
pursued multiple legal actions not to address any real danger or harm, but as “strategic 
maneuvers to lock in ‘temporary’ orders” ensuring Petitioner’s removal 
Such acts were inherently malicious and without justification. Petitioner was entitled to 
be with his Children – instead, Defendants’ actions wrongfully divested him of that 
entitlement. 
31. Damages (Count 1): As a direct result of this tortious interference, Petitioner
has suffered damages in an amount within the jurisdictional limits of the Court. His 
damages include, but are not limited to: loss of business income for being unable to 
conduct his normal course of business for the last year,  loss of the value of the 
parent-child relationship during the period of interference; mental anguish and 
emotional suffering caused by being separated from his Children; expenses incurred in

he depends on for work (including legal fees and investigative costs); and other economic 
losses such as lost business opportunities and housing costs stemming from his ouster. 
Texas Family Code § 42.006 specifically allows recovery of mental suffering and 
anguish for violation of possessory rights, all of which Petitioner has experienced. These 
losses are ongoing and increasing as the interference continues. 
32. Furthermore, Defendants acted with malice and intent to harm Petitioner,
warranting the imposition of exemplary (punitive) damages under Tex. Fam. Code 
§ 42.006(b) and Chapter 41 of the Civil Practice & Remedies Code. Defendants’ conduct
was outrageous, deliberate, and undertaken with conscious disregard for Petitioner’s

Emotional Distress (“IIED”) against Petitioner. Under Texas law, IIED occurs when: (1) 
the defendant acted intentionally or recklessly, (2) the conduct was extreme and 
outrageous, (3) the actions caused the Petitioner emotional distress, and (4) the emotional 
distress was severe. All elements are met here.

bounds of decency” and is utterly intolerable in a civilized community. Texas courts 
have recognized that behavior calculated to destroy the bond between parent and child 
can be outrageous. Morgan lied under oath repeatedly (alleging nonexistent abuse, 
poverty, etc.), exploited the trust of the court, and effectively kidnapped the Children 
under color of law. She did so with malice aforethought, aiming to cause Petitioner the 
maximum emotional pain – the loss of his children – as punishment for uncovering her 
affair. Branthoover, in turn, facilitated this scheme with knowing disregard of the harm it 
would inflict. It is hard to conceive of a more cruel and emotionally abusive act than to 
falsely portray a parent as dangerous and remove his children from him without 
cause. Defendants’ conduct offends basic societal standards of decency and has been 
described as a “travesty” and “alarming” even within the context of the court 
record. 
35. Intent or Recklessness: Morgan’s intent to cause emotional harm to
Petitioner (or at least reckless disregard thereof) is evident. By her own words and 
actions, her priority was to silence and punish Petitioner. When Petitioner confronted her 
with evidence of her infidelity, she did not respond by addressing the issue honestly or 
seeking a fair separation – instead, she embarked on a campaign to “ensure 
Respondent’s removal” at all costs.

indeed, she weaponized the Children as pawns to hurt Petitioner. Even if her primary 
motive was self-interest, she certainly knew with substantial certainty that Petitioner

severe emotional harm to Petitioner. Branthoover likewise knew that helping Morgan 
perpetrate this fraud would cause Petitioner great anguish; any reasonable person would 
recognize that outcome as the obvious consequence of these actions. Proceeding in the 
face of that knowledge is the epitome of recklessness. 
37. Severe Emotional Distress: As a direct result of Defendants’ outrageous
actions, Petitioner has suffered severe emotional distress. The distress is ongoing and 
has manifested in depression, anxiety, humiliation, and despair. Petitioner has 
experienced sleeplessness, loss of appetite, and a profound sense of injustice and grief. 
He has been deprived of the joys of watching his children grow – their birthdays, 
holidays, and everyday moments have been lost to him, causing an emotional void that 
cannot be quantified. The trauma of being falsely painted as a danger and seeing his 
children turned against him has caused Petitioner mental pain far beyond what any 
person should bear. This distress has substantially disrupted Petitioner’s daily life and 
ability to function. He has required counseling/therapy to cope, and even that is 
insufficient to fully address the harm. The severity of Petitioner’s emotional suffering 
meets and exceeds the standard required under Texas law (which demands a high degree 
of mental pain and distress that is more than mere worry, anxiety, or anger). Here, 
Petitioner’s entire familial world was unraveled maliciously – a truly catastrophic 
emotional injury.

inflicted on Petitioner stems not only from the interference with custody (Count 1) but 
also from the cumulative effect of the lies, betrayal, and abuse of process. Should the 
court find that any aspect of Defendants’ conduct (for example, the defamatory 
implications of false abuse allegations, or the misuse of legal process) is not fully 
remedied by another tort, IIED should apply to ensure Petitioner is made whole. In any 
event, Defendants’ conduct is so egregious that public policy would allow an IIED claim

Petitioner seeks to recover all damages allowable by law. This includes compensation 
for past and future mental anguish, emotional pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of 
life, and any physical symptoms or illness resulting from the severe stress. No cap on 
damages applies to intentional torts of this nature, and Petitioner will ask the trier of fact 
to award a sum that reflects the enormity of the harm (in an amount far in excess of the 
minimum jurisdictional limits). Petitioner also seeks punitive damages on the IIED

conduct. Texas law recognizes that children have a right to the “positive benefits flowing 
from parental love, affection, protection, emotional support, services, 
companionship, care, and society” of their parents.  
Depriving a child of a parent’s support and companionship is a grave injury to the child. 
Here, Defendants’ actions intentionally deprived the Children of the support, nurture, 
and companionship of their father, Petitioner. This includes both emotional support 
(parental consortium) and financial support that Petitioner would have provided. 
41. Intentional Deprivation: Morgan knew that by removing Petitioner from the
home and blocking all contact, she was also depriving the Children of their father’s 
presence and support. She proceeded in spite of that, placing her own interests above 
the Children’s emotional needs. Such conduct evidences a “profound disregard for her 
children’s needs.” Indeed, Morgan was so consumed with maintaining her fraudulent 
narrative and pursuing extramarital relationships that she willfully ignored the harm to 
the Children.  
42. Branthoover, by enabling Morgan, likewise demonstrated disregard for the
impact on the Children. Defendants cannot claim ignorance – it is obvious that children 
suffer when a loving parent is unjustly kept from them. The Children here have 
effectively suffered the loss of a parent (albeit still living, but absent by Defendants’ 
design) for an extended period. This loss is analogous to, if not worse than, the loss a 
child experiences from a parent’s severe injury. In Texas, a child is entitled to recover for 
loss of parental consortium when a parent is seriously injured by a third party’s tort.

(reputational and relational rather than physical), but the end result for the Children is 
the same: they have been bereft of their father’s daily love, guidance, and care. The 
law should not countenance a situation where a tortfeasor escapes liability simply 
because the harm was achieved through abuse of legal process rather than physical injury. 
44. Emotional and Developmental Harm: As detailed, the Children have
experienced emotional turmoil, confusion, and grief from the sudden loss of Petitioner’s 
involvement. They have been denied the comfort of his love, bedtime stories, help with 
homework, coaching at sports, and countless other forms of parental support that were 
part of their lives. This deprivation has likely caused lasting psychological harm, 
manifesting in anxiety, behavioral changes, and academic impacts. They have effectively 
lost the daily affection and guidance of their father, a loss that courts have recognized 
as compensable in tort when caused by wrongdoing. Additionally, by undermining 
Petitioner’s ability to provide, Defendants have also jeopardized the Children’s financial 
support. Petitioner, as the primary earner, would have used his income for the Children’s 
benefit – providing them a stable home, educational opportunities, and necessities. When 
Morgan ousted Petitioner and commandeered the finances under false pretenses, the 
Children’s financial security was damaged. For example, Morgan’s misappropriation of 
joint funds (the $1,576 and possibly more) and her reckless handling of assets (e.g. 
damaging a car that Petitioner must pay for) depleted resources that would otherwise 
have gone toward the Children’s upbringing. Furthermore, Petitioner’s diminished

Children’s financial security was damaged. For example, Morgan’s misappropriation of
joint funds (the $1,576 and possibly more) and her reckless handling of assets (e.g.
damaging a car that Petitioner must pay for) depleted resources that would otherwise
have gone toward the Children’s upbringing. Furthermore, Petitioner’s diminished

earning capacity resulting from this ordeal (he lost access to his home office/business and

spent substantial time on legal battles) directly translates to less support available for the 
Children. 
45. Further, the oldest child, M.E.M., barely surpassed the third grade without the
guidance of her father, someone who would always assist her with school prior to his 
removal. Exhibit 8
46. Children’s Claim for Relief: Considering the above, the Children, by and
through Petitioner, state a cause of action for the intentional deprivation of their right to 
support and consortium of their father. This cause of action is grounded in general tort 
principles of intentional injury to familial relationships, as well as the strong public 
policy of Texas to protect the parent-child bond. While Texas’s recognition of a child’s 
loss-of-parent consortium claim has typically involved cases of a parent’s physical injury 
or death, the rationale applies here with even greater force because Defendants’ conduct 
was intentional and malicious toward the parent-child relationship itself. The Children 
were the foreseeable and indeed intended victims of Morgan’s scheme – she knew 
isolating Petitioner would necessarily mean depriving the Children of their dad’s care, 
and she proceeded anyway. Such deliberate harm to children is actionable. 
47. Damages to the Children (Count 3): The Children seek damages for the loss
of their father’s consortium, love, and affection from January 16, 2024 to present (and 
continuing). This includes compensation for their mental anguish, emotional pain, and 
loss of enjoyment of life during their formative years without their father. Even at their 
young ages, the Children have deeply felt the loss – crying for their father, asking why he 
is gone, and exhibiting signs of emotional trauma. These noneconomic damages are

to such losses, and courts have allowed recovery for a child’s loss of a parent’s 
companionship and society when caused by a defendant’s tort.  
48. Additionally, to the extent the Children suffered any economic harm (such as
loss of financial support or trust funds diminished by Defendants), they seek recovery of 
those amounts as well. 
49. The Children also seek exemplary damages against Defendants for this
claim. Intentionally inflicting harm on minor children by robbing them of a parent is 
reprehensible. Morgan’s actions violated her fundamental duty as a parent to act in her 
children’s best interests, instead of using them as leverage in her deceit. Punitive damages 
are warranted to punish Defendants and deter others from similar conduct. 
IV. REQUEST FOR IMMEDIATE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
50. Need for Immediate Relief: Petitioner, both individually and as Next Friend
of the Children, hereby applies for a Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO”) and 
Temporary Injunction to immediately restore the Children to Petitioner’s custody 
(or at least resume meaningful possession/access) and prevent further irreparable harm. 
The facts detailed above show that Petitioner has a probable right to the relief sought on 
final trial, and there is a probable, imminent, and irreparable injury in the interim if 
relief is not granted. Money damages, while sought, are inadequate to fully compensate 
the loss of time with one’s children. Every day that passes is irretrievable for the 
Children’s upbringing and Petitioner’s relationship with them. No amount of money 
can restore lost childhood moments or erase the trauma of prolonged separation. Thus, 
only injunctive relief can prevent ongoing irreparable injury by restoring the status quo.

51. Likelihood of Success on the Merits: Petitioner has made a strong prima
facie showing of his case. Defendants’ fraud and misconduct are essentially undisputed 
– Morgan has never denied the core factual allegations, and the documentary evidence
(texts, bank records, court filings) overwhelmingly supports Petitioner’s claims. 
Petitioner has already presented much of this evidence to various courts without any 
rebuttal from Morgan. In essence, Petitioner’s evidence stands unchallenged, and it 
demonstrates that the current custody arrangement was obtained by fraud and is contrary 
to law. Given this, Petitioner is exceedingly likely to prevail on the merits of his tort 
claims and ultimately have the prior orders set aside. 
52. Imminent, Irreparable Harm: The harm to be enjoined is the continued
separation of the Children from Petitioner’s custody and care, and any further acts by 
Defendants to interfere or conceal the Children. This harm is imminent and ongoing – 
every moment of continued separation is harm occurring in real time. It is irreparable 
because once passed, time with one’s children cannot be recovered or adequately 
compensated. The Children are growing and changing; Petitioner is missing milestones 
that will never repeat. Additionally, the Children’s emotional well-being is at stake – 
prolonging the separation risks permanently damaging their relationship with Petitioner 
and their trust in their parents and the legal system. Texas courts recognize that the 
parent-child relationship is unique and irreplaceable, and its unjust interruption 
constitutes irreparable injury as a matter of law.

elapsed. The urgency is underscored by the fact that over a year has already been lost; 
the Court must act now to prevent further harm. 
54. No Adequate Remedy at Law: Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law for
the injuries described. While Petitioner does seek monetary damages, those alone will not 
make him or the Children whole. The law does not favor substituting dollars for parents. 
Only the return of the Children to Petitioner’s custody/possession and the cessation of 
Defendants’ interference can truly restore the status quo and serve the Children’s best 
interests. The ongoing divorce proceeding has proven inadequate to promptly address the 
issue – despite Petitioner’s diligent efforts, the family court has not provided timely relief
. Thus, equitable relief is necessary here and now. 
55. Balance of Equities and Public Interest: The balance of equities strongly
favors Petitioner and the Children. Granting the TRO/injunction merely restores what 
should never have been taken – a father’s presence in his kids’ lives – and aligns the 
situation with the truth (that Petitioner poses no danger). Denying relief would reward 
fraud and allow an innocent family to suffer further. Defendants cannot claim any 
legitimate interest in continuing to enforce a fraudulent status quo. Morgan may argue 
she will be inconvenienced or upset by losing sole possession, but any such “harm” is 
self-inflicted by her misconduct and is far outweighed by the harm to the Children of 
continued separation. Moreover, it is in the public interest to reunite the Children with 
Petitioner. Texas’s public policy (Tex. Fam. Code § 153.001) is to ensure children have 
frequent contact with parents who act in their best interests; – here, Petitioner 
unquestionably is such a parent, and nothing suggests otherwise. The public also has an 
interest in deterring litigants from abusing court processes through false claims;

granting injunctive relief sends a message that the court will not abide orders built on 
fraud.  
56. Finally, a TRO and injunction will promote stability for the Children: rather
than the current limbo, they will have both parents available, which is presumptively 
better for them (and even for Morgan, who can also see the Children, as the goal is to 
ensure both parents share time). 
57. Requested Injunctive Relief: Therefore, Petitioner respectfully requests that
the Court enter a TRO immediately and, after notice and hearing, a temporary 
injunction, ordering the following relief: 
•
a. Immediate Custody/Access: Morgan Michelle Myers shall immediately
surrender the Children to Petitioner’s custody. Petitioner shall be restored to
possession of the Children and the marital residence at 6641 Anne Court,
Watauga, TX, forthwith. In the alternative, the Court should at least grant
Petitioner immediate and unsupervised access to the Children on a frequent
schedule (e.g. joint or alternating custody) pending further orders. This ensures
the Children are no longer wrongfully kept from their father.
•
b. Enjoining Interference: Defendants (and anyone acting in concert with them)
are restrained from interfering with Petitioner’s custody or access to the
Children. They shall not remove the Children from Tarrant County without Court
permission, shall not conceal or hide the Children’s location, and shall not take
any action to prevent or hinder the contact between Petitioner and the Children.

c. Suspension of Prior Orders: To the extent necessary, the Court should
suspend the operation of the March 14, 2024 “Temporary Orders” or any
other orders that currently limit Petitioner’s access to the Children as they are
facially void ab initio. The Court has authority to do so because those orders were
obtained by fraud, lack the consent of both parties, and have never served the best
interests of the Children. The injunction should clarify that Morgan may not
enforce any prior order to exclude Petitioner from the home or children, and that
this Court’s injunctive order supersedes any conflicting provision, and that the
Petitioner’s custody and access to the residence are explicitly restored pending
trial on the merits.
•
d. Preservation of Evidence: Defendants should be enjoined from destroying or
altering any documents, communications, or evidence relating to the matters in
this suit (including electronic evidence like text messages, emails, social media
posts, bank records, etc.), to ensure a fair trial on the merits. (This is standard but
particularly warranted given the allegations of fraud.)

e. Other Equitable Relief: The Court may impose any other conditions deemed
necessary to effectuate the purposes of the injunction, such as ordering family
counseling or supervised transition if the Court finds it helpful (though Petitioner
maintains he poses no risk that would necessitate supervision).

These lawsuits involve common questions of law or of fact as the parties have a
current divorce case pending in the 322nd Judicial District Court, Cause No. 322-744263-23.
2.
It would serve the convenience of the Court, litigants, and counsel and would

these lawsuits under the older and lower cause number.

TO THE HONORABLE 233"! DISTRICT COURT:

Petitioner, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, respectfully submits this motion to strike
Respondent’s answer and motion to consolidate, and in support thereof, would show the court the

I. STATEMENT OF FACTS

3. The Respondent’s answer and motion to consolidate were filed on Cooper Carter’s
behalf by Roderick D. Marx, a party not named in either this suit or the related divorce suit (322-
744263-23). 
4. Roderick D. Marx has filed all pleadings on Cooper Carter’s behalf because Cooper
Carter’s electronic filing manager credentials are registered under the law farm Cantey and 
Hangar, LLP. See Exhibit 1. 
5. Respondent’s answer and motion to consolidate are an attempt to subvert the relief the
children desperately need, and failed to argue as to how these pleadings are in the best interests 
of the children. 
A. Sudden Activity after Months of Delay
6. Respondent’s Answer asserts the existence of a prior divorce case (Cause No. 322-
744263-23) involving the parties as a basis to delay or abate this Suit Affecting Parent-Child 
Relationship (SAPCR). However, that divorce case has been stalled for months with no 
meaningful action by Respondent or her alleged counsel. Respondent’s counsel has failed to 
diligently prosecute the divorce matter, and a dormant case cannot justify stalling this separate 
SAPCR proceeding. In short, the children’s issues should not be put on hold due to an unrelated 
divorce case that remains inactive. 
B. SAPCR Suit Focus (Lack of Child-Related Response)
7. This SAPCR is focused on the welfare and best interests of the children, yet the
Respondent’s Original Answer is devoid of any substantive response regarding the children. 
Respondent merely states that the information required under Texas Family Code §§154.181(b) 
and 154.1815 “will be provided at a later date”and then enters a general denial. No specific

conservatorship, support, or visitation issues are addressed at all. By failing to engage with the 
core child-related allegations in the Petition, Respondent’s Answer is irrelevant to the central 
issues of this proceeding and provides the Court with nothing of substance on the SAPCR 
matters. 
8. Respondent’s Answer claims that it was “necessary for Respondent to secure the
services of COOPER L. CARTER, a licensed attorney, to prepare and defend this suit”. Yet the 
pleading was filed under the letterhead of Marx, Altman & Johnson (Attorney Roderick D. 
Marx’s firm) and is electronically signed by Cooper L. Carter as “Attorney for Respondent”. 
This inconsistency creates confusion as to who represents Respondent in this case. Texas practice 
expects clarity in counsel of record (see Tex. R. Civ. P. 8 requiring designation of lead counsel), 
but here Respondent’s Answer sends mixed signals by invoking Mr. Carter’s name and services 
while being filed through Mr. Marx’s firm. Such a contradiction in representation is procedurally 
improper and fails to clearly identify the attorney in charge of Respondent’s case. 
9. In addition to the above, there are irregularities in the manner Respondent’s Answer
was filed. Upon information and belief, the Answer was submitted via an Electronic Filing 
Manager (EFM) account registered to Cooper L. Carter under the law firm Cantey & Hanger, 
which is not the firm appearing on the pleading. In other words, the electronic filing credentials 
used do not match the law firm or attorney officially listed on the document. This raises serious 
concerns about the validity of the filing and compliance with Texas e-filing rules (see Tex. R. 
Civ. P. 21(f)). Filings must be made by the attorney of record under their proper account for 
transparency and proper notice. Using an EFM account associated with a different firm (Cantey 
& Hanger) for a pleading filed under Marx, Altman & Johnson’s banner is a procedural anomaly 
that calls into question whether Respondent’s Answer was filed in accordance with the required

procedures.  Further, the email address COOPERCARTER@MAJADMIN.COM associated with 
the pleadings filed in this court is NOT registered under the EFM in which they were filed. 
10. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 21(f) requires that electronic ﬁlings be made through
an authorized EFM account corresponding to the attorney of record. The use of an account 
registered under one ﬁrm (Cantey & Hanger) to ﬁle pleadings under a different ﬁrm’s name (Marx, 
Altman & Johnson) constitutes a procedural violation, undermining the validity of the ﬁling and 
raising concerns about whether the attorney of record actually authorized or executed the ﬁling. 
11. This discrepancy calls into question the legitimacy of Respondent’s Answer and
warrants immediate review by the Court. Given the attorney filing the document did not use 
their own credentials under which the pleading was submitted, yet claimed her individual 
services were necessary, renders the filing as procedurally defective and should be struck 
from the record sua sponte. 
PRAYER FOR RELIEF 
12. Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court strike Respondent’s Original Answer
and motion to consolidate in its entirety sua sponte. Petitioner further requests that Respondent 
be required to refile any answer or responsive pleading in compliance with all applicable 
procedural rules – including proper attorney-of-record designation and use of correct electronic 
filing credentials – and to ensure that any such pleading addresses the substantive SAPCR issues 
regarding the children. Petitioner also prays for such other and further relief, at law or in equity, 
to which he may be justly entitled.

NO. 233-765358-25 
IN THE 233RD DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THE 233RD DISTRICT COURT: 
COMES NOW, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, Petitioner pro se, and files this Rule 12 
Motion to Show Authority pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12, and respectfully shows 
the Court as follows: 
1. There is a general presumption that an attorney is acting with authority; however, that
presumption is rebuttable. Breceda v. Whi, 187 S.W.3d 148, 152 (Tex. App.--El Paso 2006, no 
pet.). If evidence or circumstances cast doubt on the attorney’s authority, the presumption gives 
way and the attorney must prove actual authority. For example, an attorney who conducted a trial 
is presumed authorized to pursue an appeal, but that presumption can be rebutted with contrary 
evidence. Here, the unusual facts surrounding Ms. Carter’s involvement thoroughly rebut any 
presumption of her authority to represent the Respondent named in this matter, Morgan Michelle 
Myers, as detailed below.

I. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12 – Attorney Must Show Authority
A. Carter’s Lack of Authority Indicia
2. A party in a suit or proceeding pending in a court of this state may, by sworn written
motion stating that he believes the suit or proceeding is being prosecuted or defended without 
authority, cause the attorney to be cited to appear before the court and show his authority to act. 
The notice of the motion shall be served upon the challenged attorney at least ten days before the 
hearing on the motion. At the hearing on the motion, the burden of proof shall be upon the 
challenged attorney to show sufficient authority to prosecute or defend the suit on behalf of the 
other party. Tex. R. Civ. P. 
3. Multiple red flags call into question whether Carter is authorized – or even genuinely
acting – as Ms. Myers’s counsel, justifying relief under Rule 12. Petitioner respectfully requests 
that the court requires RODERICK D. MARX and COOPER L. CARTER to appear and show 
their authority to represent MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS in this matter to clear up the 
ambiguity surrounding their representation. 
B. Pleadings Filed by Proxy
4. Every filing attributed to Carter in this case was filed through another attorney, Roderick
Marx, rather than by Carter herself. Mr. Marx is the founding partner of the MAJ firm Carter 
formerly worked for, and he submitted documents “on her behalf” through the electronic filing 
manager. In effect, Carter has not personally prosecuted or defended anything – someone else is 
handling the filings. This raises serious doubts about whether Carter is acting as counsel or whether 
Mrs. Myers’s case is being carried (or neglected) by others without a clear designation. An attorney 
of record should be the one signing filings or at least directly supervising and endorsing them; if

not, the court and opposing party cannot even be sure the attorney whose name is on the pleadings 
is truly involved. Such proxy filings strongly indicate that Carter may lack authority or engagement 
– if she had authority, one would expect her direct participation. Rule 12 is meant to prevent exactly
this sort of scenario where a suit might be conducted by someone without clear authorization. 
C. Employment/Firm Misrepresentation
5. Carter’s own public statements conflict with the representations made to the court about
her role. While her pleadings continued to identify her as “Cooper Carter, Marx Altman & 
Johnson” (with a MAJ email address), her initial response in the instant case was filed by Roderick 
D Marx, signed by Cooper Carter with the Marx, Altman & Johnson letterhead, and then claimed 
that Cooper L. Carter was retained in her individual capacity. Further: 
i. Carter’s public Facebook profile claims that she is no longer employed with Marx,
Altman, & Johnson. 
ii. Carter’s public LinkedIn profile claims that she is no longer employed with Marx,
Altman, & Johnson, and that she currently is employed at Cantey and Hanger, LLP. 
iii. Carter’s Electronic Filing Manager is registered under ccarter@canteyhangar.com.
This level of ambiguity is unnecessary and could be deliberate. In fact, Texas law requires attorneys 
to keep their State Bar profile updated with current employment information (Tex. Gov’t Code 
§ 81.115), which currently reflects her employment with Marx, Altman & Johnson.  So the
question remains: why would Carter update her Texas State Bar profile to reflect her current 
employer but leave her social media and LinkedIn outdated?

6. Carter’s complete failure to prosecute the divorce case for an extended period also
undercuts any claim of active authority. An attorney who is truly acting with a client’s authorization 
is expected to pursue the client’s interests diligently – e.g. respond to motions, appear at hearings, 
move the case forward. Carter, however, has been conspicuously silent. She has not plead any 
defense for her client, has not participated in any discovery.  
7. Carter’s abrupt appearance in this suit—after months of silence in the divorce case—
mirrors the same confusion and procedural uncertainty that plagued the divorce action. This re-
emergence appears tactical, not substantive, and should not obstruct the SAPCR’s merits-based 
progression. She has not mentioned anything about the children, their status, or how the current 
situation is what’s best for them.  
8. Carter’s only notable action in the last six months related to her client has been to seek
consolidation of the SAPCR with the dormant divorce – essentially tethering the active custody 
matter to a paralyzed divorce case which would further prejudice the children and delay the relief 
sought. 
II. Conflicts of Interest and Duty of Candor
9. Misrepresenting one’s role or affiliation can also create conflicts of interest and
breaches of the duty of candor. If an attorney signs pleadings stating it was “necessary to retain 
their legal services” while filing under a firm’s name, it muddles who was retained – the individual 
lawyer or the firm. This ambiguity can prejudice the client’s interests and the opposing party’s 
understanding of the representation. 
10. For example, in the case at hand the answer explicitly stated, “It was necessary for
Morgan [Michelle] Myers to secure the services of COOPER L. CARTER, a licensed attorney, to

prepare and defend this suit.”.  Yet, the filing was styled as coming from “Marx Altman & 
Johnson” with Carter as the attorney. If Mrs. Carter was operating as a solo practitioner at that 
point, the pleading arguably misled the court about who had been hired. This kind of 
misrepresentation may violate the lawyer’s candor toward the tribunal (e.g. Tex. Disc. R. 3.03 
or its equivalents) since it obscures a material fact – the lawyer’s true status. Courts have held that 
lawyers must not omit facts necessary to keep statements from being misleading. Failing to clarify 
that the attorney is no longer with the named firm, it could be seen as an omission that makes the 
filing as a whole misleading. 
III. Unauthorized Filings and “Ghost” Representation
12. Having documents filed by another attorney who has not formally appeared is another
problematic practice. In proper procedure, every pleading or motion must be signed by an 
attorney of record – i.e. a lawyer who has made an appearance in the case. Texas is clear: “Every 
pleading of a party represented by an attorney shall be signed by at least one attorney of record 
in his individual name.” If Attorney A is counsel of record, it is improper for Attorney B (who 
has not appeared in the case) to file documents on A’s behalf without disclosure or court 
permission.  
13. In the example above, the e-filing system’s certificate shows “Roderick Marx on
behalf of Cooper Carter” as the filer, neither of which have formally appeared. This kind of 
“ghost filing” blurs who is responsible for the document. Courts frown upon undisclosed 
involvement of attorneys because it can circumvent accountability and confuse the record. At 
best, it is an irregular practice; at worst, it could be seen as misrepresentation to the court. Here, 
given the same circumstances exist in the divorce case which has been abandoned, Petitioner 
believes the situation leans more towards misrepresentation.

14. Procedurally, if an attorney who is not counsel of record submits a filing, the court
may treat that filing as nullity or require it to be redone. No appearance means no authority to 
act. From an ethical standpoint, using another lawyer to file pleadings without notice may 
implicate rules against aiding in rule violations. Lawyers are forbidden from assisting or 
inducing others to violate the rules (see Tex. Disc. R. 8.04(a)(1). If Attorney A knows they 
should appear officially but instead has Attorney B file a document to evade a procedural 
requirement, both attorneys tread on thin ice. They could be seen as trying to circumvent the 
rules of the tribunal. At a minimum, this lack of transparency undermines trust. The proper 
course would have been for the second attorney to file a notice of appearance (if joining the case) 
or for the original attorney to personally sign and file the pleading. Having someone “cover” a 
filing without formal acknowledgment is not a recognized practice. In short, any attorney 
involved in a case needs to either be of record or stay behind the scenes entirely. But if an 
attorney actually files or signs on behalf of the attorney of record, that person effectively steps 
into the role of counsel without the court’s knowledge, which is improper. It is better to err on 
the side of disclosure – either by formal association of that attorney or by avoiding involvement 
in filing. 
15. As pointed out, the Petitioner believes that this is occurring because Carter’s EFM
account is setup under her prior employer’s email address. So why not change it to reflect the 
correct address and file your own pleadings? Lastly, these same issues have been present in the 
divorce matter, and although Carter was served with a Rule 12 motion in that case on September 
20, 2024, she has yet to clear up this issue.  
IV. CONCLUSION AND PRAYER
For the above stated reasons, Petitioner requests the following relief from the court:

IN THE 322ND DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
To the Honorable Judge of the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County: 
REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION
There is a general presumption that an attorney is acting with authority; 
however, that presumption is rebuttable. Breceda v. Whi, 187 S.W.3d 148, 152 
(Tex. App.--El Paso 2006, no pet.); Kelly v. Murphy, 630 S.W.2d 759, 761

Antonio v. Aguilar, 670 S.W.2d 681, 684 (Tex. App.--San Antonio 1984, writ 
dism'd) ("[A]n attorney who has conducted a case in the trial court is 
presumed to have authority to pursue an appeal, although this presumption can 
be rebutted."). Here, however, this presumption is to be rebutted for the 
foregoing reasons:

I. Legal Basis for Rule 12 Motion
2. Pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. § 12, a party may challenge an attorney’s
authority to act on behalf of a party in a proceeding. When such a challenge is 
raised, the burden of proof shifts to the challenged attorney to demonstrate 
their authority to represent the party. Id. The attorney must appear before the 
trial court and show sufficient authority to prosecute or defend the suit on 
behalf of their client. (Breceda v. Whi (2006) 187 S.W.3d 148, 152; Kelly v. 
Murphy (1982) 630 S.W.2d 759, 761). 
3. Rule 12 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure permits any party to
challenge an attorney’s authority to prosecute or defend a lawsuit. (See Nolana 
Open MRI Ctr., Inc. v. Pechero (2015) No. 13-13-00552-CV, at *15). The 
purpose of a Rule 12 motion is to protect parties from groundless suits and to 
permit dismissal of suits instituted without authority. (See Nicholas v. Envtl. 
Sys. (Int’l) Ltd. (2016) 499 S.W.3d 888, 895; Angelina Cty. v. McFarland 
(1964) 374 S.W.2d 417, 422–23). 
4. Here, the procedural inconsistencies, lack of formal notice, and
submission of documents by other parties on behalf of Ms. Carter raise 
substantial doubts about whether she possesses the necessary authority to 
represent the Petitioner. Despite being allegedly retained on January 22, 2024, 
Ms. Carter has not filed a formal notice of appearance, leaving her role 
ambiguous. Further complicating matters, filings under her name have been 
submitted by others, including the founder of Marx Altman & Johnson, her 
purported former employer. Coupled with her suspiciously timed State Bar 
profile update and lack of meaningful engagement, these facts compel the 
Respondent to seek clarification and challenge her authority under Rule 12.

II. Procedural Basis
5. No Formal Notice of Appearance Filed. Although Cooper Carter
was allegedly retained on January 22, 2024, she has not filed a formal Notice 
of Appearance in this case. The absence of a Notice of Appearance creates 
substantial ambiguity regarding her authority to represent the Petitioner, 
especially given the procedural irregularities discussed below.  
6. Lack of engagement. Throughout the proceedings, Ms. Carter
has consistently failed to engage in any meaningful way and has failed 
to respond to any pleadings in the suit. 
7. Filings Submitted on Behalf of Cooper Carter. All court
documents and pleadings attributed to Ms. Carter have been submitted "on her 
behalf" by Roderick Marx, the founder of Marx Altman & Johnson. There 
is no indication that Ms. Carter is directly involved in this matter, raising 
significant questions about whether she is properly authorized to act as 
counsel for Morgan Michelle Myers.  
8. Discrepancies in employment. On Ms. Carter’s public social
media, she claims to be a former attorney for Marx Altman & Johnson and 
claims to be employed currently with Cantey Hanger LLP.1 The timeliness of 
her profile aligns with the public article released by Cantey Hanger LLP

themselves.2 Further, Every attorney in Texas is required by law to maintain a 
current and up-to-date profile. Tex. Gov’t Code § 81.115. Notably, Ms. 
Carter’s profile was updated on March 13th, 2024, one day prior to the only 
hearing that has occurred in this matter3 to her former employer. The 
Respondent has actively been seeking relief from the result of the 
aforementioned hearing for nearly seven months without any engagement or 
any authoritative activity from Ms. Carter, thus warranting this motion. 
III. Prayer and Relief
9. Given the ongoing procedural irregularities and the apparent lack of
clarity surrounding Cooper Carter’s authority to represent Petitioner Morgan 
Myers, the Respondent respectfully requests the following: 
i.
The Court should schedule a hearing requiring Cooper Carter to
personally appear and definitively prove her authority to represent
Morgan Myers, and to provide clarification as to who is involved in
the case, and in what capacity Morgan Michelle Myers is being
represented  in this matter.
ii.
"Upon [her] failure to show such authority, the court shall refuse
to permit the attorney to appear in the cause, and shall strike the
pleadings if no person who is authorized to prosecute or defend
appears." (Tex. R. Civ. P. 12; see Kindle v. Wood Cnty. Elec. Co-op, Inc.
(2004) 151 S.W.3d 206, 210)

being of the children – including immediate medical needs, schooling needs, financial 
needs, and emotional needs that the Petitioner has the ability, desire, and duty to satisfy. 
The Respondent has disrupted the stable living environment enjoyed by the 
children up until the Petitioner's unlawful exclusion on March 6, 2024. They have been 
left without a Father for over thirteen months without any legal justification and are now 
being raised by their elderly great-grandparents in place of their Father. 
The forthcoming and undisputed facts uncover the true intent behind the 
Respondent's actions and clearly demonstrate the need for the Petitioner's immediate re-
entry into their lives. 
I. STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION
This Court has jurisdiction, and the authority grants the requested relief because 
no valid existing orders bar such action. The only prior orders affecting the parties were 
issued in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County, but those orders are void and of no 
legal effect. Under Texas Family Code § 201.013(b), an associate judge's order does not 
become final unless and until the referring district court judge signs the order. 
Moreover, the orders claim that all parties agree to the terms of the order despite 
the Petitioner's signature being absent. In the prior proceedings (Cause Nos. 322-744263-
23 in the 322nd District Court), an associate judge signed a "temporary" order on March 
14, 2024 that purported to be an agreement between the parties. Critically, no district 
judge of the 322nd District Court ever signed or adopted that order, as required by law.

should be declared void by this court, or in the alternative, voidable, and vacated without 
delay. There is effectively no valid court order currently governing the parties' residence 
or conservatorship rights. This Court may therefore proceed to protect the children's 
welfare and the parties' rights as justice requires, unimpeded by the defective 322nd 
District Court order. 
Furthermore, this court has jurisdiction because the Respondent cannot argue that 
the related cause number retains dominated jurisdiction. Texas law does allow a court to 
lose dominant jurisdiction if the party with the first suit proceeded in bad faith or the suit 
is not actively pursued. Both apply here, as demonstrated below. The first suit was 
unquestionably brought in bad faith, and the case hasn't been actively pursued for over 
six months by the opposition, leaving the children in procedural limbo and their needs 
unaddressed. 
II. STATEMENT OF FACTS

Respondent's grandmother and paid for by the Petitioner, who had access to the account. 
(these records are voluminous and will be provided at hearing) 
2. On December 14, 2023, in response to this discovery, the Respondent made
plans to visit the residence of an individual named DANIEL KENNETH 
BRANTHOOVER, her stepfather.

58. On December 14, 2024, the case was REMANDED by the Northern District

of Texas for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

59. On January 12, 2025, Petitioner filed a MOTION TO DISMISS FOR WANT

OF PROSECUTION.

60. On March 18, 2025, Petitioner filed an original SAPCR and motion for

injunctive relief with this court.

61. On March 22, 2025, the Petitioner learned through a family member that

Respondent's public Facebook profile states "In a Relationship since February, 2024".
62. On March 22, 2025, the Petitioner informed the opposing party of this motion.

63. On March 23, 2025, the Petitioner filed this suit with this court seeking
immediate and emergency relief given the extraordinary circumstances leading up to this

point.
Il. IMMEDIATE NEED FOR RELIEF

64. Every day that Petitioner remains barred from his home and children inflicts
irreparable injury on both Petitioner and the children. Irreparable harm means an injury
that cannot be adequately compensated for money damages or corrected later. That is

exactly the case here.

MR 8.12

=== PAGE 135 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
65. Petitioner is being deprived of the irreplaceable experience of parenting his
children during their formative years. No amount of monetary compensation or later 
visitation can make up for the lost time, missed milestones, and emotional bonding that 
has been denied for over a year. Courts have recognized that interference with custodial 
or visitation rights constitutes irreparable harm, as time lost with one's child is gone 
forever. The children are likewise losing the benefit of a father's love, guidance, and daily 
care – a harm that is unquestionably irreparable. If this wrongful separation continues, the 
risk increases that the parent-child bond could be permanently damaged. Reunification 
becomes harder as more time passes; thus the urgency is extreme. 
66. The children have been suffering confusion, instability, and emotional distress
due to the sudden absence of Petitioner and the drastic changes imposed by Respondent. 
They went from having both parents in their daily life to seeing only one parent, with no 
satisfactory explanation. Respondents' insertion of a new father-figure (Mr. Kazlauskas) 
has exacerbated their confusion and anxiety. This kind of emotional turmoil in young 
children can lead to long-term psychological issues – a classic irreparable injury, as the 
court cannot later repair the trauma inflicted on a child's sense of security. Restoring 
Petitioner's presence is needed now to begin healing the damage and to reassure the 
children that their father has not abandoned them. The more time that passes, the deeper 
the potential harm to the children's mental health. 
67. Petitioner's fundamental right to maintain his familial relationship with his
children (protected by the U.S. and Texas Constitutions) is being violated. Such a 
violation is inherently irreparable. Deprivation of one's home – being ousted without 
cause – is also a profound personal harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law.

Petitioner has effectively been made a stranger to his own family and property based on 
false pretenses. If the Court does not act, the Petitioner will continue to suffer intangible 
harms such as loss of income, anguish, and the erosion of his role as a father, none of 
which can be quantified or compensated later. 
IV. THE RESPONDENT'S MISCONDUCT
Perjury and Aggravated Perjury (Tex. Penal Code §§ 37.02–.03) 
68. Texas law makes it a crime to make false statements under oath. Perjury
occurs when a person, with intent to deceive, makes a false statement under oath in a 
proceeding where an oath is required. 
69. If the false statement is made in connection with an "official proceeding" and
is material, it becomes Aggravated Perjury, a third-degree felony. In civil cases, 
knowingly submitting false affidavits or testimony can also constitute perjury and be 
treated as a fraud upon the court. Courts have recognized that false sworn statements in 
family law matters are serious misconduct, undermining the judicial process and 
potentially warranting sanctions or even criminal referral (e.g., Skepnek v. Mynatt, 8 
S.W.3d 377, 381 (Tex. App. – El Paso 1999) (attorney sanctioned $30,000 for filing false 
affidavit). 
70. Here, Respondent swore to multiple false statements under oath, meeting all
elements of perjury and aggravated perjury. For example:

71. On December 18, 2023, Respondent filed a sworn "Affidavit of Inability to
Pay" court costs, claiming she had only $20 in her bank account. This statement was 
knowingly false. Just two days prior, Respondent had transferred $1,576.00 in marital 
funds to herself, as confirmed by text messages with her relative (Dan Branthoover) on 
December 16. She then appeared in court swearing she was penniless and could not 
afford the $400 filing fee. In that same affidavit, Respondent also lied that she alone paid 
certain expenses (two car loans and $800 rent plus utilities), when in fact Petitioner had 
been paying those bills; he continued to pay for the vehicles Respondent claimed to 
finance on her own. Bank statements and financial records will clearly establish this fact 
on the merits. Respondent's counsel has never refuted these facts. Thus, Respondent 
made multiple false statements under oath, meeting Penal Code § 37.02. Because these 
affidavits were filed in court proceedings and were material to the case (securing a fee 
waiver and influencing the court's actions), they also qualify as aggravated perjury under 
§ 37.03. Each false statement was material to issues before the court (Respondent's
financial status and credibility), satisfying the materiality requirement. 
False Statements in Protective Order Filings 
72. Respondent submitted false sworn statements in her applications for
protective orders. Texas Family Code § 82.009 requires that an application for a 
temporary ex parte protective order "contain a detailed description of the facts" of alleged 
family violence and be sworn as true by the applicant. Respondent sought an ex parte 
protective order on or about Dec. 14, 2023, claiming abuse, yet on Dec. 22, 2023, she 
was photographed laughing and playing with the children alongside Petitioner – conduct 
wholly inconsistent with someone in fear of imminent harm. In fact, that same day, she

had applied for a second protective order against the Petitioner with similar allegations. 
No credible evidence of family violence was ever presented in thirteen months of 
litigation but has been used as a barrier from accessing the home where the Petitioner is 
needed. 
73. The contextual evidence of falsity (her normal familial behavior with
Petitioner the same day she sought Protection) defeated her sworn claims of "fear" or 
violence and display that they were indeed fabricated. At the very least, her contradictory 
sworn assertions – e.g. claiming on Dec. 18 to have an "active" protective order based on 
family violence (to justify a divorce waiver) when in truth none existed – demonstrate a 
reckless disregard for the truth under oath. 
74. These false protective order filings were not isolated incidents but part of a
calculated strategy to remove Petitioner from the family home and children's lives. The 
timing of these filings—immediately after the discovery of Respondent's extramarital 
relationship with Mr. Kazlauskas—reveals their true purpose: not to protect against 
genuine violence, but to preemptively silence Petitioner and prevent him from exposing 
Respondent's infidelity and financial misconduct. By falsely claiming fear while 
simultaneously engaging in normal family activities with Petitioner, Respondent 
demonstrated the fabricated nature of her allegations. 
75. The pattern of deception is unmistakable: Respondent drained the family bank
account on December 15-16, filed false indigency claims on December 18, falsely 
claimed an existing protective order in her divorce petition that same day, then filed yet

Controlling Law 
76. False testimony or affidavits in a civil proceeding can warrant severe
consequences. While the proper remedy for "intrinsic" fraud (false statements on issues 
litigated at trial) is often a new trial or sanctions rather than voiding a judgment, courts do 
not hesitate to act on clear perjury. Texas courts have inherent authority to address fraud 
on the court, and criminal prosecution for aggravated perjury is a possibility for egregious 
lies under oath. Indeed, aggravated perjury in court proceedings is a felony punishable by 
2–10 years' imprisonment (Tex. Penal Code § 37.03(b)). 
77. That is precisely what has occurred in this case, and Respondent should face
some consequences for her actions, but Petitioner believes that prolonged incarceration 
would not be in the best interests of his children, but that some form of legal repercussion 
is necessary to deter similar behavior in the future. She has made no effort to defend 
these claims, no effort to prosecute her case, and the Petitioner prays that this court 
realize the severity of this situation on those effected most: the children.

the children relied on the most from their lives despite a valid legal reason, and has

81. Respondent's conduct constitutes a blatant violation of the "best interest"
standard mandated by Texas Family Code §§ 153.001 and 153.002. Texas law declares it 
the public policy of this state to assure that children have frequent and continuing contact 
with parents who act in the child's best interest, to provide a safe and stable environment 
for the child, and to encourage both parents to share in raising the child. Moreover, the 
best interest of the child must always be the court's primary consideration in matters of 
conservatorship and access. Respondent has flagrantly defied these principles by 
prioritizing her extramarital relationship with Mr. Damen Kazlauskas over the emotional, 
psychological, and familial stability of her own children.

(evidenced by over 6,500 text messages);

a willingness to confuse and emotionally harm her children to justify her own choices, in 
direct contravention of her duty to prioritize the children's emotional well-being. 
Prioritizing an Extramarital Relationship Over Family 
91. Compounding the harm, Respondent is openly celebrating a relationship with
Mr. Kazlauskas – a man with whom she entered an extramarital relationship while still 
married to Petitioner. She has flaunted this relationship and positioned Mr. Kazlauskas as 
a replacement father figure to the children, celebrating milestones with him that should be 
reserved for family. In doing so, Respondent elevates her personal relationship over her 
children's need for stability and continuity with their real father. This behavior sends the 
children a disturbing message: that their father's role in their lives is interchangeable or 
unimportant. Such a message is detrimental to the children's best interests, as it 
undermines their sense of security, identity, and trust in their family structure and the 
close relationship that they have shared with their father throughout their lives.

This behavior is not only cruel; it is directly contrary to the children's best interests and

allowing Petitioner to fulfill his parental role and provide daily care and support to the 
children, Respondent has relegated this responsibility to extended family members, 
depriving the children of their father's presence, guidance, and care during crucial 
developmental years.

father cannot be overstated. Research consistently shows that children benefit from the 
active involvement of both parents, and that unnecessary disruption of the parent-child 
bond can cause lasting psychological damage. By prioritizing her personal relationship 
over her children's need for both parents, Respondent has demonstrated a fundamental 
misalignment with the "best interest" standard that Texas law demands be the "primary 
consideration" in all matters affecting children. 
96. Despite the Respondent’s egregious actions, the Petitioner wishes her no ill
will as she is the mother of his Children and only seeks an amicable path forward that 
suits their best interests. As of now, the Children need their father, and this situation 
engineered by the Respondent shows that her fitness as a parent has been called into 
question, and her priorities are not in the correct place. Petitioner vows his return to the 
family home will only bring much needed stability to his children and will be in their best 
interests for their day-to-day livelihood.

MR 7.27
The children are suffering daily from their father being prevented
access to the marital home. The Respondent has prevented access
since March 6, 2024, knowing the Petitioner's need for the residence to work.
This has left the children without the care of either parent for the majority
of the time, and are being told that the divorce has been finalized
and that their father is a bad person.
Prior to the Respondent's removal, the Children were cared for both emotionally and financially by the Petitioner. The Respondent
knowingly and willingly sabotaged this relationship to further her own agenda with a separate relationship.
The emotional well-being and stability of the children have been destroyed, and their stable life has been dismantled
by the Respondent in bad faith. There exists no legal basis for the current situation to persist,
and the children are already showing signs of distress, emotional trauma, and are beginning to struggle academically.
The children need the Petitioner's stable, nurturing care during this difficult time, and they will soon lose all access to their Father who will be homless given the circumstances.
The Petitioner has been fighting for over a year to get back into his residence to no avail. The Respondent has refused to participate, and 
continues to prioritize her new relationship over the children. Notice would only spark more deceptive legal actions from the Respondent to try and subvert justice.

IN THE 233RD DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
INTRODUCTION 
1. Texas law does generally require consolidation of divorce and custody matters to
avoid conflicting parallel litigation. Under Family Code § 6.407, if a SAPCR involving the child 
is already pending in one court when a divorce is filed in another court, the SAPCR must be 
transferred to the divorce court so that one judge handles everything. Likewise, if the parents 
are in the middle of a divorce, any new custody suit typically should be joined into that divorce 
case instead of proceeding separately. The policy behind this is to have one court speak on all 
parent-child issues at a time, preventing inconsistent orders. In a normal scenario, if Parent A 
filed for divorce (including child custody) in Court X, Parent B would not be allowed to file a 
separate SAPCR in Court Y at the same time – the law would mandate that the child’s case be 
heard in the first-filed divorce court. 
2. So, generally, an active divorce case would mean any custody claims belong in that
lawsuit, not in a new, independent suit elsewhere.

INTRODUCTION

1. Texas law does generally require consolidation of divorce and custody matters to
avoid conflicting parallel litigation. Under Family Code § 6.407, if a SAPCR involving the child
is already pending in one court when a divorce is filed in another court, the SAPCR must be
transferred to the divorce court so that one judge handles everything. Likewise, if the parents
are in the middle of a divorce, any new custody suit typically should be joined into that divorce

filed for divorce (including child custody) in Court X, Parent B would not be allowed to file a
separate SAPCR in Court Y at the same time — the law would mandate that the child’s case be

heard in the first-filed divorce court.

lawsuit, not in a new, independent suit elsewhere.

3. However, § 6.407 assumes the initial divorce suit is properly filed and being pursued.
Its joinder and transfer rules are meant to coordinate valid, concurrent proceedings. It does not 
explicitly address a situation where the original divorce/SAPCR is essentially a sham or has 
stalled out. In your case, while technically the divorce case exists, it was filed in bad faith and 
has produced no valid orders or final judgment. This puts it outside the typical scenario § 6.407 
contemplates. If the original case is on track to be dismissed or is proven to be jurisdictionally 
defective, there may soon be no “pending” case to join into. Thus, the usual mandatory joinder 
rule may not pose a long-term barrier, especially if you move to dismiss the old case for lack of 
prosecution. In short, ordinarily you must litigate child issues in the divorce suit, but when 
that suit is effectively defunct or void, the rationale for mandatory joinder falls away. 
II. Dominant Jurisdiction and Exceptions for Bad-Faith First Filings
4. Even when no final order exists, Texas follows a “first in time” rule for parallel cases:
the court where a suit is first filed generally has dominant jurisdiction, meaning it has the 
primary right to proceed, and any later-filed suit involving the same parties and issues should be 
abated (paused) or dismissed. Applied here, because the divorce case was filed earlier, a new 
SAPCR in another court would normally face a plea in abatement from the first filer. The second 
court would typically defer to the first-filed court’s authority over the matter. But importantly, 
Texas law also recognizes exceptions to the first-filed rule in cases of inequitable conduct. If the 
person who filed the first suit did so merely to gain an upper hand (for example, to lock in a 
preferred venue or harass the other parent) without any genuine intent to prosecute the case, 
that behavior can estop (prevent) them from claiming the benefits of dominant jurisdiction. 
5. Here, this is precisely what has occurred. COOPER L. CARTER, attorney for
Respondent, has not prosecuted the first-filed case in over eight months. Her authority remains

in question under rule 12 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and hasn’t filed the mandatory 
notice of remand after federal removal, which occurred back in December of 2024. This 
procedurally prevents the case from moving forward until this requirement is met, which has not 
only been pointed out to Ms. Carter, but has been wholly disregarded. 
6. Now, Ms. Carter is before this court seeking to consolidate the SAPCR suit filed and
captioned above back into the original suit in which she has not been prosecuting. Such action 
would further prejudice the children, and Ms. Carter should have to explain why she has failed to 
prosecute the main case, but yet can show up here and request consolidation. If Ms. Carter were 
genuinely looking to uphold the best interests of the children in this case, she wouldn’t allow 
their well-being to hang in the balance within the originally filed case – but she has been – which 
is why this SAPCR was brought before this court.  
7. Further, The Texas Supreme Court in Curtis v. Gibbs explained that a first filer’s bad
faith or fraud can remove the shield of the first-filed rule and allow a later suit to go forward. 
This also applies here. Ms. Carter’s client initiated the divorce action in bad faith, and waived the 
60-day waiting period for divorce claiming an active order of protection was in effect against the
undersigned. This was elected for the sole purpose of gaining an unfair advantage in the divorce 
proceedings. Once this advantage was gained, she stopped prosecuting the suit. 
8. Generally, if Suit 1 was essentially a placeholder or manipulation (filed “merely to
obtain priority, without a bona fide intention to prosecute the suit” and the filer’s conduct kept 
Suit 2 from being filed sooner, a court can find that Suit 1 was an inequitable sham. In that event, 
the second court may deny the plea in abatement and take the case, effectively jumping past 
the first court. Id. Here, the facts suggest the prior divorce action was in bad faith and then 
abandoned – precisely the kind of scenario in which Texas courts allow an exception to the

abandoned — precisely the kind of scenario in which Texas courts allow an exception to the

“first-filed” rule. The Respondent in this matter had no serious intent to pursue the 
divorce/SAPCR (e.g. they filed to harass or to get temporary orders, then let the case languish), 
giving this court the discretion to refuse to abate/consolidate this SAPCR. The first court’s 
dominant jurisdiction dissolves if the first suit was a null effort. Therefore, given the 
circumstances, the opposing counsel should have to explain the reasoning behind her failure to 
prosecute before consolidation ordered under the assertion that it is “mandatory”. 
III. Filing a New SAPCR in a Different Court Under These Circumstances
9. Given the above, nothing in Texas law absolutely bars the undersigned from filing
a new SAPCR for his children in this court, because the original case truly produced no final 
orders and is effectively moribund. Texas Family Code § 155.001(d) explicitly provides that if no 
final order has been rendered in a SAPCR, any subsequent suit regarding the child is simply 
treated as a new original proceeding. 
9. That means the undersigned legally permitted to start fresh with a new custody suit
because the first case never culminated in a final judgment. Additionally, the Texas Supreme 
Court has described a subsequent SAPCR in these circumstances as “a new suit in which no 
court has continuing exclusive jurisdiction”. Curtis v. Gibbs, 511 S.W.2d 263, 267 (Tex. 1974) 
(orig. proceeding) - confirming that a pending-but-unresolved prior case does not freeze the 
undersigned out of seeking relief from this court on behalf of his children. 
IV. The Old Case Faces Statutory Dismissal for Failure to Prosecute
10. Interestingly, the first case has already had a motion to dismiss for want of
prosecution filed. Unfortunately, due to Ms. Carter’s inability to prosecute the case, it remains in 
procedural limbo never properly remanded from federal court. So even if the cases were

“first-filed” rule. The Respondent in this matter had no serious intent to pursue the
divorce/SAPCR (e.g. they filed to harass or to get temporary orders, then let the case languish),
giving this court the discretion to refuse to abate/consolidate this SAPCR. The first court’s
dominant jurisdiction dissolves if the first suit was a null effort. Therefore, given the

Court has described a subsequent SAPCR in these circumstances as “a new suit in which no

undersigned out of seeking relief from this court on behalf of his children.

10. Interestingly, the first case has already had a motion to dismiss for want of

procedural limbo never properly remanded from federal court. So even if the cases were

MR 9.5

=== PAGE 159 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
consolidated, she would have no ability to proceed with the litigation, effectively putting this 
scenario back in the same spot, which would be prejudicial to the children. 
11. Under the Curtis v. Gibbs line of cases, the new court has authority to determine if the
first filer’s conduct was inequitable. The Petitioner in this matter has not received any counter 
argument or denial regarding the claims of the Respondent’s inequitable conduct, only 
continuous attempts to subvert justice for the children named in this suit. 
12. The key point is that no “continuing, exclusive” jurisdiction binds the
undersigned or the children to the old case, and an abandoned/invalid suit should not 
prevent a parent from protecting their child’s interests in a new forum. The law intends for 
one court at a time to handle a child’s case, but it does not reward a party who tried to game the 
system by filing first and then dropping the ball. The undersigned has proceeded diligently and 
transparently in the new SAPCR, and Texas law provides a path for him to do so. 
IV. CONCLUSION
13. Because the prior divorce/SAPCR never resulted in a valid final order (and its only
interim orders are void), that court never obtained continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the 
children. In the INTEREST OF A.F., W.J., A.J., and J.J., Children No. 02-19-00117-CV. A parent 
in this situation is generally free to initiate a new SAPCR as an original proceeding in the 
appropriate court. TEX. FAM. CODE 155.001(b)(2). While Texas law usually tries to funnel all 
custody matters into one court, it will not force you to remain tethered to a lawsuit that was filed 
in bad faith and then abandoned. The doctrines of continuing exclusive jurisdiction and 
mandatory joinder do not bar a new suit when the original case is effectively a nullity. Here, 
that is precisely the case, and until these points are rebutted by the opposing party, they prevail.

consolidated, she would have no ability to proceed with the litigation, effectively putting this

scenario back in the same spot, which would be prejudicial to the children.

4. This places the obligation on COOPER L. CARTER to file with the clerk of the state
court a certified notice of remand, which she has failed to do as of March 31, 2025, nearly three 
months later. 
5. COOPER L. CARTER’s authority to represent MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS has been in
question since September 20, 2024, in cause number 322-744263-23 and is similarly in question in the 
instant case. 
6. COOPER L. CARTER has never filed a pleading on MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS’ behalf
in either this court or the 322nd district court since she was allegedly retained on January 22, 2024, in her 
individual capacity over fourteen months ago. 
7. RODERICK D. MARX has filed every pleading on behalf of COOPER L. CARTER in both
this matter and the divorce matter. 
8. RODERICK D. MARX has not made an appearance or otherwise been named as a party in
either suit. 
9. Neither RODERICK D. MARX nor COOPER L. CARTER have filed any response to any
pleadings served to them by CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS. 
10. Neither RODERICK D. MARX nor COOPER L. CARTER have filed any pleading since
April 24, 2024, in the divorce matter, nearly twelve months ago. 
11. COOPER L. CARTER has left the 322nd District Court without any ability to proceed
to final trial, thereby resulting in an inevitable dismissal for want of prosecution. Exhibit 2 
12. COOPER L. CARTER’s EFM is registered to her prior employer’s email address,
which has been pointed out several times by Petitioner. Exhibit 3 
13. The 322nd District Court of Tarrant County does not have continuous exclusive
jurisdiction of the minor children. 
14. The Petitioner opened a separate SAPCR before this court in March of 2025.

instant case.

6. COOPER L. CARTER has never filed a pleading on MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS’ behalf

April 24, 2024, in the divorce matter, nearly twelve months ago.

11. COOPER L. CARTER has left the 322" District Court without any ability to proceed
to final trial, thereby resulting in an inevitable dismissal for want of prosecution. Exhibit 2

12. COOPER L. CARTER’s EFM is registered to her prior employer’s email address,
which has been pointed out several times by Petitioner. Exhibit 3

13. The 322™ District Court of Tarrant County does not have continuous exclusive

Coordinator to select dates for the TRO hearing prior to his presentation once he arrived at the 
court. Exhibit 6 
19. The parties selected April 10, 2025, to have the hearing, and the Petitioner went
before the Associate Judge to present his emergency TRO. Exhibit 7 
20. Prior to being called up to present, the Associate Judge left the room and conversed
with the court coordinator. 
21. When she returned, Petitioner was called up to present the emergency TRO.

to instead file the pleading with the 322nd District Court.

25. The Associate Judge disagreed and refused to hear the emergency TRO.
26. At the close of business on March 28, 2025, nothing was ever filed with the 322nd
District Court by COOPER L. CARTER.

correct in his legal position. 
28. Petitioner’s detriment to his position is the fact that he is self-represented.
29. Respondent’s detriment to her position is the lack of prosecution or defense.
II. ARGUMENT
30. When it comes to remand, the obligation falls on the plaintiff to file with the state
court a certified copy of the order of remand. TEX. R. CIV. P. 237a; see also Kashan v. McLane 
Co., NO. 03-11-00125-CV, 7 (Tex. App. Jun. 7, 2012) (holding that rule 237a’s notice 
requirements cannot be satisfied by the district court, but must come from the plaintiff.)  
31. This prevents any trial on the merits, and prevents any relief to the Petitioner and his
children. 
32. All other facts supported by evidence have already been provided to COOPER L.
CARTER yet continues to not engage and instead call in favors from the bench. 
III. CONCLUSION
Petitioner traveled to this court with a prepared emergency supported by exhibits only to 
be turned away at the eleventh hour due to his self-represented status and in the face of no real 
opposition. The children were denied due process outright, and now have been left without a 
remedy. The proper course of action should have been to hear the TRO and put in place 
protections for the minor children pending any promises of consolidation.

The above statement of facts, unless promptly rebutted by COOPER L. CARTER, warrant 
immediate relief as duly requested in the emergency TRO through a declaratory judgement, and this court 
should proceed with the hearing date originally set for April 10th, 2025, and the emergency TRO should be 
GRANTED without further delay. 
COOPER L. CARTER disrupted much needed relief for the minor children in this case with false 
promises delivered to the tribunal that directly undermined the Petitioner’s due process rights. COOPER L. 
CARTER is fully aware that she cannot file anything in 322nd District Court because in doing so she would 
be acting ultra vires.   
Petitioner reasserts his position that COOPER L. CARTER is acting without authority, has no 
ability to comply with 237a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and cannot explain how she is able to 
abandon a case for nearly a full calendar year, yet can suddenly show up to defend her alleged client before 
this court for the sole purpose to prevent Petitioner’s emergency TRO from being heard, which was 
permitted despite being told he could present the motion. In what sense is this appropriate when children 
are involved? Does the attorney’s license give her a free pass to thwart the rules and litigate in bad faith? 
It may be a needle in the haystack, but this case defies the initial presumption that pro-se litigants 
are not as equipped or as capable as licensed attorneys, and it is no fault of COOPER L. CARTER. The 
Petitioner reminds the court that the true culprit responsible for this circumstance remains the puppet master 
hiding in the background – the Respondent – and yet Petitioner wishes no harm to her because this litigation 
is about the children. The children need their mother, but they also need their father.  
Perhaps the zealous passion has been misunderstood for contempt by the tribunal, but Petitioner’s 
motive runs parallel to that set forth in the Texas Family Code. However, despite the procedural quagmire, 
the anomalies, the pro-se status, the solution remains simple:  
Grant the relief. Nobody has argued against it, Texas law demands it, and the best interests of the 
Children depend on it. There remains no logical or legal basis to give COOPER L. CARTER any further 
deference in the face of Petitioner’s self-represented status. Petitioner welcomes any response from

COOPER L. CARTER to the contrary. If such response were to be filed, it would be the first in over fourteen 
months of litigation. 
If approached from a logical standpoint, the situation can be interpreted as such: 
i.
COOPER L. CARTER is shackled by Rule 12 and Rule 237a of the
Texas Rules of Civil Procedure from reaching final trial.
ii.
The 322nd District Court is shackled from proceeding due to Cooper
L. Carter’s failure to prosecute.
iii.
The Petitioner is shackled from his home, his children’s daily lives,
and his place of business under facially void orders that claim
consent.
iv.
Most critically, the children are shackled in a situation that is not in
their best interests and continue to suffer irreparable harm without
any opportunity for relief and without any lawful basis.
Indeed, that leaves just one party un-chained from this situation: 
the Respondent. Petitioner rests his case. 
IV. PRAYER
WHEREFORE promises considered, the Petitioner, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, 
requests the following expedited relief: 
1. Take judicial knowledge that COOPER L. CARTER disrupted an emergency in
bad faith and failed to fulfill her promise.
2. Grant the emergency TRO without delay and keep the original hearing date set
for April 10th as agreed by the parties on March 28th, 2025.
3. Give no further deference to attorney COOPER L. CARTER, who has not
prosecuted nor defended her position, and require a written response.

Petitioner, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, submits this notice to provide a different

I. BEFORE AND AFTER
1. This side-by-side comparison illustrates the stark differences in the children’s
quality of life, parental involvement, and household stability before and after the removal of 
the Father from the family home. It presents a clear, fact-based evaluation of how the familial 
environment, care structure, and overall wellbeing of the children have been significantly 
impacted. Each point demonstrates a substantial decline in stability, support, and morality—
raising urgent concerns about the children’s best interests, safety, and development under the 
current arrangement.

This situation is destructive, and truly a one-sided case. Respondent’s prolonged silence,

outweigh the benefits that the children would reap if relief were to be granted. All the Petitioner 
asked for in the beginning was time. Now, time has been wasted, and we remain in the same 
spot. The point is – the Mother cannot just fabricate family violence to have Father removed 
from the home – especially when she knew and benefitted from his at-home business operations 
which have since been significantly damaged. Despite all the harm done, the Petitioner is 
confident that it can be repaired, the family  can get back on track, and this process can be 
finalized without sacrificing the stability and well-being of the children that they have been 
accustomed to throughout their lives.

To: Cooper Carter <coopercarter@majadmin.com>
Ms. Carter,
Pursuant to Tarrant County Local Rule 3.30(c)  , this letter provides notice that I intend to present an Emergency Ex
Parte Application for Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) seeking immediate relief in the interest of my children’s well-
being and to prevent irreparable harm to my property, family relationships, and ability to earn a living.
The TRO will NOT request exclusive temporary use of the marital residence but that if your client has issue, she has
alternative housing and has used possession of the residence to damage my livelihood and restrict my parenting time.
The application will include verified evidence supporting the necessity of immediate relief, including:
Verified communications acknowledging my need for the home to work
Records of financial losses from displacement (Airbnb receipts, business losses, etc.)
Evidence of your client disposing of or concealing my personal property
Proof that the children have been left unsupervised overnight by your client on multiple occasions.
Documentation from the school showing excessive absences and academic concerns regarding Mara.
Text evidence between myself and the multiple AIRBNB hosts showcasing the difficulty faced in setting up
operations outside of the reliable setup of the house.
Photographs and texts contradicting claims made in previous pleadings
Dental neglect of my youngest daughter (photos of untreated cavities)
Financial documents showing I paid all vehicle and rent obligations, contrary to your client’s claims
Text messages between myself and the grandparents of your client showing we can be amicable during this
situation and put the children first.
Photo evidence showing the only way I have to communicate with my daughters is via an online game, ROBLOX,
due to your client preventing communications.
My criminal record showing that I have never been convicted of a violent crime.
The current temporary orders which are facially void and can be collaterally attacked in any court at any time.
Again, there is absolutely zero reason to have me barred from the residence and strip the children of their parents. It
contradicts the lodestone of the Family Code which is in the best interests of the children. 
This is the more logical solution. If we pursued this route in the beginning, we'd already be divorced and the children's
financial stability wouldn't have been sacrificed. There is no risk of danger. There is no risk of harm to the children. There
is only the possibility of recovery. That is in their best interests.
There is no legal reason your client has to want me out of the house other than just that. She cannot unilaterally decide
that I agree to everything and then do as she pleases with my personal belongings and neglect the children in multiple
areas.
Your argument that I agreed to the orders in place falls flat on its face for many reasons which will not be repeated here.
I am providing this notice strictly to comply with Local Rule 11(e). I will proceed to present the application to the Court
without further delay due to the nature of the harm and urgency involved.
If you wish to discuss these matters, I'm happy to do so - otherwise I will inform the court that you do not agree to the
orders upon submission.
This situation cannot continue, and the alternatives that are available must be pursued to uphold the best interests of the
children before any further damage to their well-being is sustained.
Respectfully,
Charles Dustin Myers

Cooper,
Petitioner (your client) filed the original divorce petition in December 2023 in the 322nd District Court (Cause No. 322-
744263-23). In that petition, she alleged false claims of family violence and sought a waiver of the 60-day waiting
period for divorce, ostensibly to expedite temporary relief by labeling me as an abuser and claiming she had an active
order of protection against me at the time of filing. 
On February 1, 2024, a temporary orders hearing was held before an Associate Judge. The parties (through counsel)
announced an apparent agreement on temporary custody and other matters. The associate judge signed an “Associate
Judge’s Report for Temporary Orders”, titled as “Agreed Temporary Orders.” Importantly, this report did not itself
constitute a signed court order; instead, it outlined the agreed terms and directed further action before any order would
be final. Specifically, the report stated that Respondent's attorney (Dan Bacalis) would prepare a formal temporary
orders document, which would be prepared from 20 days from the date of signing, which would have been February
22nd, 2024. It also required that both attorneys were to approve it to form within 5 days (have 5 days to approve
the order), and that if no agreement on form was reached, a motion to sign would need to be filed within 30 days.
The report noted that the parties’ personal approval was not required for entry of the order, implying the attorneys’ sign-off
or a court motion would suffice. No district judge signed an order at that time – the associate judge’s report was
essentially a recommendation to be formalized in a written order.  
Immediately after the Feb 1 hearing, Respondent lost confidence in his attorney’s actions and fired his attorney.
Believing that the “agreement” did not reflect the child’s best interests or was entered under false pretenses (due to
Petitioner’s unfounded allegations), Respondent promptly withdrew his consent to the announced terms. On February
5, 2024, before any temporary order was signed by the court, Respondent (now pro se) filed an Emergency Motion to
Reconsider and Vacate Temporary Orders. This motion put the court on notice that Respondent no longer consented to
the supposed agreed terms and that he objected to any temporary order being entered as announced.  
Despite this, the reconsideration was denied and no findings were ever entered. In fact, the order explicitly ordered
Respondent to sign the orders to which he did not agree in violation of his own directives.
Texas law is clear that an associate judge’s report or proposed order is not a final, enforceable court order
unless and until it is adopted and signed by the referring court. Under the Family Code, an associate judge may
conduct hearings and recommend orders, but those recommendations remain subject to approval by the district court
judge. Section 201.011 of the Texas Family Code provides that an associate judge’s report “may contain the associate
judge’s findings, conclusions, or recommendations and may be in the form of a proposed order”. In other words, the
associate judge’s report (even if titled “Temporary Orders”) is essentially a draft or advisory decision; it does not itself
carry the force of a court order until the proper procedures are completed.  
Family Code § 201.013 unambiguously outlines how and when an associate judge’s proposal becomes an order of the
court. If a party timely requests a de novo hearing by the referring judge, the associate judge’s proposed order may be
enforced in the interim (except for certain matters) pending that hearing. However, if no timely request for a de novo
hearing is filed, the statute states that “the proposed order or judgment of the associate judge becomes the
order or judgment of the referring court only on the referring court’s signing the proposed order or judgment.”
Thus, absent a de novo appeal, an associate judge’s recommendation must be signed by the district judge to have any
legal effect. Until the judge signs it, it is merely a proposed order, not an actual court order.  
Because the February 1, 2024 temporary orders were never signed or adopted by the court, Respondent was (and is)
under no legal obligation to follow them, and neither party could properly enforce those terms through contempt or other
remedies. A party cannot be held in contempt for violating a non-existent court order. Here, the “Agreed Temporary
Orders” are, at most, an agreement between the parties that was not entered as a judgment. When Respondent withdrew
his agreement (as discussed below), even that contractual underpinning fell apart.  The Family Code’s requirements were
not met, and thus the purported temporary orders are void ab initio due to lack of rendition or entry by the referring
court.  
The stage is thus set for this Court to intervene, because as of now, there is no operative temporary order governing
the child’s conservatorship or possession.  
The Purported Temporary Orders Are Void and Subject to Collateral Attack in This
SAPCR

Immediately after the Feb 1 hearing, Respondent lost confidence in his attorney’s actions and fired his attorney.
Believing that the “agreement” did not reflect the child’s best interests or was entered under false pretenses (due to
Petitioner's unfounded allegations), Respondent promptly withdrew his consent to the announced terms. On February
5, 2024, before any temporary order was signed by the court, Respondent (now pro se) filed an Emergency Motion to
Reconsider and Vacate Temporary Orders. This motion put the court on notice that Respondent no longer consented to
the supposed agreed terms and that he objected to any temporary order being entered as announced.

Despite this, the reconsideration was denied and no findings were ever entered. In fact, the order explicitly ordered
Respondent to sign the orders to which he did not agree in violation of his own directives.

Texas law is clear that an associate judge’s report or proposed order is not a final, enforceable court order
unless and until it is adopted and signed by the referring court. Under the Family Code, an associate judge may
conduct hearings and recommend orders, but those recommendations remain subject to approval by the district court
judge. Section 201.011 of the Texas Family Code provides that an associate judge’s report “may contain the associate
judge’s findings, conclusions, or recommendations and may be in the form of a proposed order”. In other words, the
associate judge’s report (even if titled “Temporary Orders”) is essentially a draft or advisory decision; it does not itself
carry the force of a court order until the proper procedures are completed.

Family Code § 201.013 unambiguously outlines how and when an associate judge’s proposal becomes an order of the
court. If a party timely requests a de novo hearing by the referring judge, the associate judge’s proposed order may be
enforced in the interim (except for certain matters) pending that hearing. However, if no timely request for a de novo
hearing is filed, the statute states that “the proposed order or judgment of the associate judge becomes the

order or judgment of the referring court only on the referring court’s signing the proposed order or judgment.”

Thus, absent a de novo appeal, an associate judge’s recommendation must be signed by the district judge to have any
legal effect. Until the judge signs it, it is merely a proposed order, not an actual court order.

Because the February 1, 2024 temporary orders were never signed or adopted by the court, Respondent was (and is)
under no legal obligation to follow them, and neither party could properly enforce those terms through contempt or other
remedies. A party cannot be held in contempt for violating a non-existent court order. Here, the “Agreed Temporary
Orders” are, at most, an agreement between the parties that was not entered as a judgment. When Respondent withdrew
his agreement (as discussed below), even that contractual underpinning fell apart. The Family Code’s requirements were
not met, and thus the purported temporary orders are void ab initio due to lack of rendition or entry by the referring
court.

The stage is thus set for this Court to intervene, because as of now, there is no operative temporary order governing
the child’s conservatorship or possession.

The Purported Temporary Orders Are Void and Subject to Collateral Attack in This

Because the February 1, 2024 temporary orders were never properly entered as a court order (and would have been
invalid if entered without consent - which is clearly the case here), they are void and can be attacked in this proceeding.
Generally, once a court renders a final judgment, parties are constrained to challenge that judgment on direct appeal or in
the original case; collateral attacks on final judgments are disfavored. However, only a void judgment is subject to
collateral attack in a separate proceeding. Browning v. Prostok, 165 S.W.3d 336, 346 (Tex. 2005) (“Browning v.
Placke, 698 S.W.2d 362, 363 (Tex. 1985)”)
In this SAPCR, Respondent is effectively collaterally attacking the temporary orders from the divorce case by asserting
their invalidity. Such a collateral challenge is permissible here because those orders are void. As the Texas Supreme
Court has explained, “Only a void judgment may be collaterally attacked.” Id.
Accordingly, Respondent asks this Court to formally declare that the March 26, 2024 “Agreed Temporary Orders” (and
any interlocutory rulings associated with them) in Cause No. 322-744263-23 are void, of no effect, and not binding on
the parties. This declaration will remove any doubt or argument by Petitioner that those terms still govern the parties’
rights. It will also foreclose any attempt to enforce or rely on those non-orders (for example, in claims of violation or in
arguing res judicata). The Court has the authority in equity and under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (Tex. Civ.
Prac. & Rem. Code chapter 37) to declare the rights and status of the parties vis-à-vis that prior proceeding – particularly
given that the SAPCR directly concerns the child who was also at issue in the divorce temporary orders. Granting such
relief is appropriate to prevent confusion and multiplicative litigation. Once the prior “orders” are declared void, this Court
can proceed to issue fresh temporary orders for the child without any conflict or cloud from the divorce case.  
In sum, the prior temporary orders are a legal nullity and this Court should treat them as such. The Court’s order declaring
them void will simply recognize the reality that, due to the procedural faults and lack of consent, those orders never had
legal existence. This clarification is critical to move forward in protecting the child’s welfare, as discussed next.  
Immediate Emergency Relief Is Necessary to Protect the Child’s Best Interest 
Every day that passes without a valid temporary order is a day of potential harm or uncertainty for the child. The
current situation – a divorce case stuck in limbo with no operative orders, and parents in dispute – is untenable for a
child’s well-being. The child has effectively been living under an informal or contested arrangement since February 2024.
Petitioner has acted as though she has primary custody under the (void) temporary orders, while Respondent has been
sidelined and denied the normal possession or decision-making that a proper order (or a true agreement) would have
provided him. This dynamic, fueled by Petitioner’s unproven allegations of family violence, has caused significant stress
and instability for the child. Respondent fears that Petitioner is leveraging the appearance of an order to restrict his
contact with the child and to make unilateral decisions that are not in the child’s best interest. Meanwhile, the divorce
proceeding has not moved forward to a final resolution – over 12 months have elapsed since the March hearing, with no
trial setting in sight. This stalemate directly affects the child: there is no clear court-sanctioned framework for
conservatorship, visitation, or support, and your client has only introduced chaos into their lives.
This Court, now handling the SAPCR, has both the authority and the duty to step in and provide stability. Under Tex. Fam.
Code § 105.001, “the court may make a temporary order, including the modification of a prior temporary order, for
the safety and welfare of the child,” including orders for temporary conservatorship and possession.
The Family Code specifically empowers courts to act expeditiously to protect a child: if there is immediate danger to the
child’s physical or emotional health, the court can even issue temporary orders without notice (such as a temporary
restraining order) to address the emergency. Here, Respondent asserts that the child’s emotional welfare is indeed in
jeopardy. The lack of a valid order has enabled Petitioner to marginalize Respondent’s role in the child’s life, purportedly
under the guise of the void temporary orders. Petitioner’s false accusations of violence – never tested or proven in court –
have created a pretext for her to limit Respondent’s access. Consequently, the child is being unjustly deprived of time and
a relationship with Respondent, who has been a loving father with no history of abuse. This scenario is precisely what
emergency temporary orders are designed to prevent. The Court should not allow a procedural quagmire to result in a
child effectively losing a parent or receiving inferior care.  
Most importantly, the “best interest of the child” is the paramount consideration in any conservatorship or
possession decision. See 153.002 TEX. FAM. CODE.
All Texas courts must ensure that their orders first and foremost serve the child’s best interest. By that standard,
continuing under the shadow of void orders and parental discord is plainly not in this child’s best interest. Instead, the
child’s best interest calls for fresh, valid temporary orders that set forth clear, fair, and safe arrangements for custody and
visitation while the parents’ disputes are resolved. The Court should craft these orders based on current evidence and the
child’s needs – not based on an outdated and unconsented plan from February. The Family Code’s public policy (Tex.
Fam. Code § 153.001) favors frequent, continuing contact with fit parents and stable environments free of violence or
abuse. Here, Respondent is ready, willing, and able to care for the child and poses no danger, and he simply seeks a
normal custody schedule that allows the child to have both parents in his life. Petitioner’s unsupported claims of family

violence (made to gain a litigation advantage) should not dictate the child’s reality any longer, especially since those
claims have not been substantiated in any court hearing.  
Why your consolidation motion and response are insufficient, and will fail, or be
met with mandamus if granted (after reconsideration)
 Normally, even without continuing exclusive jurisdiction, a prior pending suit would require the new suit to be consolidated
or abated (as discussed above with § 6.407 and dominant jurisdiction). The mother (divorce petitioner) could argue that
the original court “has jurisdiction” over the children by virtue of the pending divorce, so the SAPCR should not proceed
separately. However, the void nature of the prior temporary orders is a game-changer. If those orders are void, then
the original case has not effectively adjudicated anything regarding the children’s current custody or support. The SAPCR
petitioner can contend that because the prior orders are null, there is no valid existing order or active management of the
children’s case, and the new court is free to act in the children’s best interests. This is the EXACT argument made. In
effect, the argument is that the divorce case’s jurisdiction over the children lapsed into dormancy or “dormant jurisdiction”
due to your failure to prosecute the case.
It’s important to distinguish jurisdiction from orders. The continuing jurisdiction doctrine would typically prevent a
different court from issuing orders if a final order existed or if another court was actively handling the case. But here the
SAPCR is filed in the same county as the divorce. There is no risk of two different counties competing; it’s an internal
issue. The SAPCR effectively asks the court to take up a new cause number and to recognize that the old cause has
stalled and its orders are void.  
EVEN IF the void argument fails, there is another nuance to this area of law. Despite the lack of a final order, the
pending divorce still technically invokes the court’s jurisdiction over the children. Typically, the proper course is to revive or
dismiss the dormant divorce, rather than maintain a wholly separate SAPCR on the side. Texas courts adhere to the
principle that the first suit filed (here, the divorce) should dominate; a later-filed suit concerning the same subject (the
children) can be abated to prevent conflicting rulings. In fact, in In re Shifflet, for example, a party attempted parallel
litigation regarding child custody, and the court emphasized that modifications must be filed in the court with jurisdiction
over the original case
The only exception to the one-court rule is narrow. Texas law does allow a court to lose dominant jurisdiction if the
party with the first suit proceeded in bad faith or the suit is not actively pursued. Both apply here. The first suit was
unquestionably brought in bad faith, as the declaration of an active protective order being in effect against the
Respondent was an intentional fabrication designed to provide your client with an advantage. Despite this, the
Texas legislature should have prevented the first hearing from ever happening, because 6.405b of the Texas Family
Code required your client to present the alleged order to the court BEFORE ANY HEARING. 
CONCLUSION 
Thus, the SAPCR is appropriately before the court, and the only argument you made in your Response fails. The court
denied my attempt to open this separate suit, requiring me to file a 17 page argument as to why the case should be
accepted, and then it was.
So your response effectively mirrors the first denial from the court, which amounts to no response being filed at all.
It is clear you are not representing your client in a manner to uphold the law or the best interests of the children, but to
only appear when needed to obstruct the much needed justice that the children need and deserve.
This is my position.

Good Morning,
Opposing party is a pro se Petitioner in the above referenced case. He has filed a SAPCR petition regarding this matter.

proceeding in the 322nd.
Could you please provide dates and times that the Court is available to hear my motion?

Ms. Wierzbicki, Mr. Carter,
Thank you for the update. However, I must respectfully object to the assertion that this is a mandatory consolidation.
Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 174(a), consolidation is discretionary and not automatic where doing so would cause
delay, injustice, or prejudice to a party. Additionally, the Texas Supreme Court in Curtis v. Gibbs, 511 S.W.2d 263 (Tex.
1974) expressly carved out exceptions to dominant jurisdiction where:
The original case was filed in bad faith,
The case isn't been prosecuted;
Equity and justice require an independent forum.
All three conditions are present here. The SAPCR was filed in good faith after the 322nd case became procedurally
stalled and legally defective—with no Notice of Remand, no evidentiary rulings on the children, and pending dispositive
motions including unopposed requests for dismissal. 
It would be prejudicial to the children to consolidate a case that had no ability to proceed.
Thank you.
Respectfully,
Charles Dustin Myers

Friends on other side,
The Emergency EX-PARTE TRO has been filed and accepted by the court and is awaiting the judge's review. 
If a hearing is required, I will CC Cooper in the email correspondence.
If a hearing is not required, I will serve each of you with a copy of the TRO and proposed order in accordance with the
rules no later than seven days prior to the hearing.
The TRO has the following provisions:
* Respondent is PROHIBITED from preventing Petitioner from entering the matrimonial residence located at 6641
Anne Ct, Watauga, TX 76148.
* Respondent is PROHIBITED from disturbing the peace of the minor children named in this suit.
* Petitioner and Respondent are PROHIBITED from acting without candor towards all members of the household
in the presence of the children.
* Respondent is PROHIBITED from bringing the children in the presence of DAMEN GAULT KAZLAUSKAS.
* Respondent is PROHIBITED from taking the children outside of Tarrant County, Texas.
These provisions, if granted, will be in effect until a full hearing is held no later than 14 days after the order is signed by
the judge.
Once the notice of hearing is served on all parties, I will be filing a motion for pre-trial conference to discuss the Rule 12
motion filed and served last week to ensure those issues are resolved prior to trial. 
At the hearing, the relief I am seeking is to convert the provisions from the TRO into temporary injunctions which will be
the exact same but will ask for them to remain until further order of the court and reset the status quo to March 6, 2024,
which was the last peaceful time enjoyed by all parties prior to the Respondent's unlawful lockout.
If a continuance is needed in order to get your affairs in order for the Rule 12 conference, please reach out as I have no
problem signing an agreed continuance if more time is needed.
I am not seeking sanctions at this time.
If granted, I believe the preceding details suit the best interests of Mara and Caroline, preserves their emotional and
financial well-being, allows myself to repair the substantial damage caused from the prior thirteen months, promotes an
amicable co-parenting relationship, and most importantly upholds Texas Law in ensuring that children have continuous,
frequent access to both parents and that parents are encouraged to work together during and after divorce because
doing so is in their best interests.
I'm not looking to punish, hurt, or ruin anyone. I'm simply looking to do what's best for the kids and start working together
to finish this so we can all move on with our lives.
If you have any suggestions, modifications, or alternative solutions, please feel free to reach out and let me know, or
schedule a time and place to meet in person that best meets your schedule.
Respectfully,

Friends on other side,

The Emergency EX-PARTE TRO has been filed and accepted by the court and is awaiting the judge's review.
If a hearing is required, | will CC Cooper in the email correspondence.

If a hearing is not required, | will serve each of you with a copy of the TRO and proposed order in accordance with the
rules no later than seven days prior to the hearing.

The TRO has the following provisions:

* Respondent is PROHIBITED from preventing Petitioner from entering the matrimonial residence located at 6641
Anne Ct, Watauga, TX 76148.

* Respondent is PROHIBITED from disturbing the peace of the minor children named in this suit.

* Petitioner and Respondent are PROHIBITED from acting without candor towards all members of the household
in the presence of the children.

* Respondent is PROHIBITED from bringing the children in the presence of DAMEN GAULT KAZLAUSKAS.
* Respondent is PROHIBITED from taking the children outside of Tarrant County, Texas.

These provisions, if granted, will be in effect until a full hearing is held no later than 14 days after the order is signed by
the judge.

Once the notice of hearing is served on all parties, | will be filing a motion for pre-trial conference to discuss the Rule 12
motion filed and served last week to ensure those issues are resolved prior to trial.

At the hearing, the relief | am seeking is to convert the provisions from the TRO into temporary injunctions which will be
the exact same but will ask for them to remain until further order of the court and reset the status quo to March 6, 2024,
which was the last peaceful time enjoyed by all parties prior to the Respondent's unlawful lockout.

If a continuance is needed in order to get your affairs in order for the Rule 12 conference, please reach out as | have no
problem signing an agreed continuance if more time is needed.

| am not seeking sanctions at this time.

If granted, | believe the preceding details suit the best interests of Mara and Caroline, preserves their emotional and
financial well-being, allows myself to repair the substantial damage caused from the prior thirteen months, promotes an
amicable co-parenting relationship, and most importantly upholds Texas Law in ensuring that children have continuous,
frequent access to both parents and that parents are encouraged to work together during and after divorce because
doing so is in their best interests.

I'm not looking to punish, hurt, or ruin anyone. I'm simply looking to do what's best for the kids and start working together
to finish this so we can all move on with our lives.

If you have any suggestions, modifications, or alternative solutions, please feel free to reach out and let me know, or

schedule a time and place to meet in person that best meets your schedule. Mi R 1 2 1 5
Respectfully, 7

Good Evening,
I have received communication from opposing party who is pro se that he will be walking through an Emergency TRO.
Our office has a hearing scheduled for tomorrow morning in Parker County and is unable to attend. However, I will be
available by cell phone regarding this matter if the Judge would like to speak to me regarding the Emergency TRO.
Please contact our office to patch me in for any calls that Judge would like to have.
Additionally, this case already is pending in the 322nd for a divorce proceeding regarding property and children matters.
We will be consolidating the case and walking it through the 322nd for signature next week.

Court staff,
Ms. Carter’s recent correspondence is improper for several reasons, and appears to be an attempt to delay or interfere
with proceedings in which she has otherwise failed to meaningfully participate in. The following reasons support this
statement:
1. An objection to consolidation is already on file and remains unopposed. It cites controlling Texas precedent. Any
suggestion that consolidation is agreed upon or inevitable is misleading. Instead, she should properly file with the court
why the consolidation is improper or at the very least argue against Petitioner's position.
2. Ms. Carter has not fulfilled her obligation under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 237a to file a Notice of Remand. Until
she does, she is prohibited from proceeding or filing anything in the 322nd District Court as they currently do not have
jurisdiction over this matter until this obligation is fulfilled.
3. Her authority to represent the Respondent remains under challenge pursuant to a Rule 12 motion filed September 20,
2024. No hearing has been held, no written statement of authority has been filed, and no ruling has been made. Until
resolved, Rule 12 bars her from participating in either proceeding.
4. Ms. Carter has not prosecuted the case in the 322nd District Court in over eight months. This inaction has prejudiced
the Petitioner and delayed resolution of urgent matters affecting the children.
5. She has failed to file any objections, responsive pleadings, or legal arguments opposing the relief requested—including
the Emergency TRO now pending.
6. Rather than reaching out to Petitioner to resolve any scheduling conflict, Ms. Carter improperly attempted to influence
the court by email. This violates the spirit of cooperation required by the rules, particularly where her participation is
procedurally barred.
7. Ms. Carter’s conduct appears designed to delay relief and subvert the best interest of the children, despite her failure to
oppose the requested relief in any meaningful way.
8. She has been provided with full notice of the Emergency TRO, the proposed order, supporting exhibits, and the time
and location of presentment. She has no legal basis to subvert Petitioner's due process rights.
In summary, Ms. Carter has not provided anything of substance in either Court, has not prosecuted the case, has not
argued on behalf of her client, or followed proper procedure.
Simply labeling the opposition as pro se and claiming that the consolidation will be filed without disclosing the above facts
is dishonest and should not be permitted as it will only cause further unnecessary delays to the relief being sought without
any substance being provided.
Again, all of these points have been argued in both courts, and it is her duty as counsel to handle these matters in
accordance with Texas Law.
These matters should be handled between the parties - not attempt to influence court staff after hours.
The reason we are here in the first place is due to the above unanswered facts. Ms. Carter has had ample time to file an
objection, response, or counter argument, but has chosen not to do so.
It would've been far more appropriate for Ms. Carter to have reached out to me directly to discuss scheduling conflicts.
Prior to the latest email, there was no indication Ms. Carter intended to participate at all despite being provided with all
relevant materials.

Good morning,
Mr. Myers appeared before me to schedule the hearing for the TRO; my apologies I did not realize this was that
same case.  We can go ahead and set the TRO with us, but most likely the case will be transferred prior to the
hearing date and the case needs to be transferred prior to that date.
Mr. Myers will be emailing with dates available for the hearing.

3/30/25, 5:10 PM Gmail - TIO MORGAN CHILDREN, CAUSE NO. 233-765358-25 CL-12105

Again, all of these points have been argued in both courts, and it is her duty as counsel to handle these matters in
accordance with Texas Law.

These matters should be handled between the parties - not attempt to influence court staff after hours.

The reason we are here in the first place is due to the above unanswered facts. Ms. Carter has had ample time to file an
objection, response, or counter argument, but has chosen not to do so.

It would've been far more appropriate for Ms. Carter to have reached out to me directly to discuss scheduling conflicts.

Prior to the latest email, there was no indication Ms. Carter intended to participate at all despite being provided with all
relevant materials.

The court should disregard this email correspondence in its entirety for the reasons stated herein as it is highly prejudicial
to Petitioner and the children.

Pro se litigants are expected to follow the rules of procedure to the same extent licensed attorneys are.
This email chain should be disregarded in its entirety.

Have a good evening.

Respectfully,

Charles Dustin Myers

Petitioner, Pro Se

Good morning,

Mr. Myers appeared before me to schedule the hearing for the TRO; my apologies I did not realize this was that
same case. We can go ahead and set the TRO with us, but most likely the case will be transferred prior to the
hearing date and the case needs to be transferred prior to that date.

Mr. Myers will be emailing with dates available for the hearing.

Thank you,

Cooper,
I've already objected.
You have no legal authority to do so until you address my objection filed and served to you.
Furthermore, you have not sent the Notice required by rule 237a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and have not
shown you authority to represent the Petitioner in this matter.
Finally, you claimed to have been retained in your individual capacity yet are claiming Marx Altman and Johnson is filing
pleadings on your behalf, and Roderick D. Marx is not a party in this suit nor has he made a formal appearance.
You're well aware of these obligations, and any order resulting from this motion will be challenged via the proper legal
proceedings.
You cannot continue to disregard the rules of procedure, fail to respond to motions or evidence served to you, and
continue to expect favors from the bench in leu of you performing your duties as a licensed attorneys.
You are put on notice that if any such motion is presented to the court in the face of the above facts or the unanswered
objection already served to you, I will move for your disqualification immediately and will provide the Texas OAG with your
information and detailed misconduct as well as the State Bar of Texas.
Further, you have not provided or served a copy of the proposed order which you intend to present, which is required.
This conversation will be filed and made apart of the official court record. 
Respectfully submitted,

MOTION TO CONSOLIDATE 
This Motion to Consolidate the above lawsuits is brought by MORGAN MYERS, who 
shows in support: 
1.
These lawsuits involve common questions of law or of fact as the parties have a
current divorce case pending in the 322nd Judicial District Court, Cause No. 322-744263-23.
2.
It would serve the convenience of the Court, litigants, and counsel and would
avoid multiplicity of suits, duplication of testimony, and unnecessary expense and delay to have 
these lawsuits consolidated for trial. 
MORGAN MYERS prays that the Court grant the Motion to Consolidate and consolidate 
these lawsuits under the older and lower cause number.

Cooper,
I've already objected.
You have no legal authority to do so until you address my objection filed and served to you.

Furthermore, you have not sent the Notice required by rule 237a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and have not
shown you authority to represent the Petitioner in this matter.

Finally, you claimed to have been retained in your individual capacity yet are claiming Marx Altman and Johnson is filing

pleadings on your behalf, and Roderick D. Marx is not a party in this suit nor has he made a formal appearance.

You're well aware of these obligations, and any order resulting from this motion will be challenged via the proper legal
proceedings.

You cannot continue to disregard the rules of procedure, fail to respond to motions or evidence served to you, and
continue to expect favors from the bench in leu of you performing your duties as a licensed attorneys.

You are put on notice that if any such motion is presented to the court in the face of the above facts or the unanswered
objection already served to you, | will move for your disqualification immediately and will provide the Texas OAG with your
information and detailed misconduct as well as the State Bar of Texas.

Further, you have not provided or served a copy of the proposed order which you intend to present, which is required.
This conversation will be filed and made apart of the official court record.

Respectfully submitted,

Charles Myers

NO. 233-765358-25 
IN THE 233RD DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT: 
I. INTRODUCTION
There comes a time in the journey of life when a man finds himself standing 
in the same muddy footprints he left as a child, gazing up at the same towering 
courthouse steps, and feeling that same sinking sensation in his chest. It’s a peculiar 
thing, this cycle of disappointment—to have lived it once as a bewildered child and 
then again as a rule-abiding adult. The faces change, the dates on the calendar 
advance, but the feeling remains as familiar as an old, worn book. 
Petitioner comes before this Court not with anger burning in his chest, nor 
with vindictiveness poisoning his pen, but rather with that quiet, heavy 
disappointment that settles in a person’s bones when they’ve done everything by

the book only to find the book itself has been shelved away, forgotten by those 
sworn to read from it.  
Petitioner followed the rules. He honored the procedures. He placed his faith 
in a system that promised justice would flow like water, clear and unobstructed, to 
those who seek it properly. He lived under the façade of facially void orders, and 
sustained extraordinary damages that were all caused intentionally by one person: 
the Respondent, who has sat in complete silence as this breakdown has continued 
to occur. 
Yet here stands Petitioner, a father twice removed—once from his home 
and once from his children—knocking on the courthouse door with papers properly 
filed, only to be told that the door shall remain closed because someone else might, 
at some future date, file papers at another door entirely. If this strikes the Court as 
a curious interpretation of justice, then we find ourselves in rare agreement. 
Mark Twain once observed that “the difference between the almost right word and 
the right word is really a large matter—it’s the difference between the lightning bug 
and the lightning.” In matters of law and children’s welfare, the difference between 
almost justice and actual justice is equally vast—it’s the difference between 
children thriving and children suffering, between a father’s presence and his 
absence, between following the law and merely gesturing toward it.  
The Petitioner is now in an extraordinary circumstance. On one hand, he

ministerial duty to hear and rule on Petitioner’s properly filed emergency TRO, 
which this Court refused to hear on March 28, 2025. The refusal came not from any 
defect in the filing itself, but solely from representations made by opposing counsel 
regarding a future filing in another court which she abandoned—a procedural 
sleight of hand that has left children in distress and a father without an adequate 
remedy for an appeal. 
On the other hand, the Petitioner must prohibit the 322nd District Court from

In essence, a procedurally improper forward-looking consolidation motion 
to be filed in a different court was used to block a properly filed emergency TRO 
before this court. The court cannot rule on a case not before it, and mandamus is 
the proper remedy here if this court refuses to act. Given the extraordinary 
circumstances of this matter, and given there has been no response or opposition to 
the relief being requested, the court should grant the emergency TRO 
immediately through a written order delivered to all the parties via the 
electronic filing manager, set the matter for a hearing 14 days from the signing of 
the order, and require a written response from the opposing party no later than 7 
days prior to the hearing.

ministerial duty to hear and rule on Petitioner’s properly filed emergency TRO,
which this Court refused to hear on March 28, 2025. The refusal came not from any
defect in the filing itself, but solely from representations made by opposing counsel
regarding a future filing in another court which she abandoned—a procedural
sleight of hand that has left children in distress and a father without an adequate
remedy for an appeal.

On the other hand, the Petitioner must prohibit the 322™ District Court from
setting a matter for a hearing that cannot bear a valid result through a concurrent
Writ of Prohibition. The proper procedure wasn’t followed, and cannot be
overlooked in the face of an emergency.

Despite the circumstances of this case, Petitioner feels that settlement will 
and could be a possibility in the future, but the priority remains to rebuild the status 
quo of the children that has been destroyed and regain the ability to provide for his 
children financially while damages are assessed and attended to. Petitioner is at the 
very least entitled to this immediate relief.  He is not asking this court for anything 
more than what it has the discretion to do and what the law demands that it must do 
given the circumstances. This intent to file mandamus is filed out of respect and 
serves as a notice to all parties of record of my position on this matter. 
Such absurdity should end with an order from this court in Petitioner’s 
favor, and in support thereof, he shows the following unopposed facts: 
II. STATEMENT OF FACTS
1. On January 24, 2025, after more than 11 months of inaction, Petitioner
filed a Motion to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution. The divorce case no 
substantive action from Respondent since April 2024, a legal ghost ship drifting 
without direction or purpose. That motion wasn’t attempted to be set for hearing 
until September of 2024, only after the Petitioner exhausted all efforts seeking 
relief throughout the Texas Judiciary without any participation from the opposing 
side. 
2. On March 19, 2025, driven by mounting concerns about the children’s
welfare and learning that the 322nd District Court did not have continuous, 
exclusive jurisdiction over the children in this matter, Petitioner filed a new

the children. The very next day, March 20, 2025, Ms. Carter suddenly reappeared 
like a character presumed missing in the second act, filing an answer to the 
SAPCR petition in this Court and thereby submitting to this Court’s jurisdiction 
by filing a response rather than a motion to abate. 
3. On March 21, 2025, Petitioner filed a verified Rule 12 motion
challenging Ms. Carter’s authority to represent Respondent in this matter—the 
second such challenge, met with the same resounding silence as the first. 
4. On March 25, 2025, Petitioner filed an Objection to Consolidation and
an Ex-Parte Emergency Motion for TRO. Two days later, on March 27, 2025, 
Petitioner contacted the court coordinator, requested a date and time to present the 
motion, and served the documents to the opposing party with the intent to present 
on March 28, 2025, at 9:00 A.M. before the Associate Judge of this Court. On that 
fateful morning of March 28, 2025, Petitioner drove to the courthouse, paid for 
parking, met with the coordinator, communicated with opposing counsel, and 
secured a hearing date of April 10, 2025. Petitioner then proceeded to the 
Associate Judge’s courtroom to present the TRO. 
5. Before Petitioner could present his case—before he could speak a single
word about his children’s welfare—he was told that Ms. Carter would be filing a 
motion to consolidate in the 322nd District Court, that his motion was improperly

her words carried more weight than Petitioner’s physical presence, his properly 
filed papers, and most importantly, the urgent needs of his children. She stopped 
the proceedings with nothing more than word of mouth for the incorrect motion. 
A true showcasing of disregard for the process, and the children. 
6. On April 2, 2025, Petitioner filed a Pre-Objection to Motion to
Consolidate in the 322nd District Court. Ms. Carter’s motion to consolidate wasn’t 
filed with the 322nd District Court until April 3, 2025—six days after she used its 
mere possibility to prevent this Court from hearing Petitioner’s emergency 
motion. Her motion disregarded Petitioner’s pre-objection entirely, as if it were 
invisible ink on the page. 
7. On April 4, 2025, unable to acquire a ruling due to Petitioner’s
objection, Ms. Carter attempted to set the motion for a hearing before the 322nd 
District Court. That same day, Petitioner filed a Pre-Objection to Motion to 
Transfer in this Court, given that a motion to transfer must come before any 
attempt at consolidation. Ms. Carter, who had been so urgently concerned about 
consolidation when it served to block Petitioner’s emergency hearing, suddenly 
claimed to be unavailable until late April—causing significant delays that could 
have been avoided had this Court simply heard the motion before it on March 28, 
2025.

8. Throughout this period of procedural maneuvering, the children have
been subjected to psychological manipulation and medical neglect. They have 
been removed from Petitioner’s care and placed with elderly great-grandparents 
on a daily basis, and are being gaslighted into a false belief that the divorce is 
finalized. Petitioner’s eldest child’s academic performance has plummeted, and 
both children have become emotionally estranged from both parents. Petitioner 
has suffered approximately $110,500 in verifiable financial damages due to being 
locked out of his home and business, and it grows each day. But the financial toll 
pales in comparison to the emotional cost of watching Petitioner’s children suffer 
while the courts exchange procedurally incorrect volleys over his head.

[1st Dist.] 2006, orig. proceeding); In re Chavez, 62 S.W.3d 225, 228 (Tex. 
App.—Amarillo 2001, orig. proceeding). The Texas Supreme Court has 
consistently held that while a court has discretion in how it rules on a motion, it 
has no discretion to refuse to rule at all. In re Blakeney, 254 S.W.3d 659, 661

motion is a ministerial act, and mandamus may issue to compel the trial judge to 
act."). 
10. This principle is not merely a procedural nicety but a fundamental
cornerstone of our judicial system. When a court refuses to hear a properly filed 
motion, it effectively denies access to justice itself. As the Texas courts have 
repeatedly emphasized, "A trial court's refusal to rule on a pending motion within 
a reasonable amount of time constitutes a clear abuse of discretion." In re Bonds, 
57 S.W.3d 456, 457 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2001, orig. proceeding). This 
abuse is magnified exponentially when the motion concerns the welfare of 
children and seeks emergency relief. 
11. The Court's refusal to hear Petitioner's properly filed emergency TRO
on March 28, 2025, constitutes a clear failure to perform a ministerial duty. This 
failure is particularly concerning given that: 
a) The motion was properly filed and noticed for hearing and the parties agreed
on a date and time set for April 10th, 2025; 
b) Petitioner communicated with court staff, physically appeared at the
courthouse ready to present the motion and was told he could present his 
motion; 
c) The motion concerned the immediate welfare of children; and
d) The refusal was based solely on representations about a future filing in

discretion and there is no adequate remedy by appeal. In re Prudential Ins. Co. of 
Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 135-36 (Tex. 2004); Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 
840 (Tex. 1992). An abuse if discretion is clearly established from point one 
below, and supported by points two through eight: 
i. First, it refused to perform its ministerial duty to hear and
rule on a properly filed motion based solely on representations 
about a future filing in another court. It’s as if a doctor refused to 
treat a bleeding patient because another doctor might, at some 
future date, claim the patient should be treated at a different 
hospital. 
ii. Second, it failed to recognize that by answering the
SAPCR petition in this Court, Respondent submitted to this 
Court’s jurisdiction and should have instead filed a motion to abate 
or should have moved to transfer the case. The law doesn’t allow 
for half-measures of jurisdiction. 
iii. Third, it failed to recognize that this Court maintained
jurisdiction until any transfer was completed pursuant to Texas 
Family Code § 155.005(d) as no final order has been rendered in

iv. Fourth, it failed to recognize that the proper procedure
for consolidation of cases in different courts requires a motion to 
transfer to be filed and granted before any motion to consolidate 
can be considered, pursuant to Texas Family Code §§ 155.201 and 
6.407. The law provides a sequence, a proper order of operations, 
that cannot be reversed or circumvented without creating 
procedural delay, which is what the emergency TRO sought to 
prevent from occurring. 
v. Fifth, it allowed opposing counsel to circumvent proper
legal procedure by influencing this Court’s decision without being

vii. Seventh, it failed to recognize that the Associate
Judge’s orders in the divorce case were never properly adopted by 
the referring District Court as required by Texas Family Code §

words: She zealously defended her client by filing an answer to the SAPCR in this 
Court, thereby submitting to this Court’s jurisdiction, only to then influence this 
Court to refuse to hear Petitioner’s properly filed motion by representing that she 
would file a motion to consolidate in the 322nd Court, which would be moot by 
statute. 
18. She had abandoned the divorce case for nearly a year, filing nothing
since April 24, 2024, only to suddenly reappear precisely when I sought 
emergency relief for the children—like a firefighter who ignores a smoldering 
house for months, only to rush in when someone else calls for help. She failed to 
respond to a Rule 12 motion challenging her authority to represent 
the Respondent, her silence speaking volumes about the nature of her 
representation. She subsequently filed an improper motion to consolidate in the 
322nd Court without first filing the required motion to transfer, putting the 
procedural cart before the horse. She is now claiming unavailability until late 
April in the 322nd Court, creating unnecessary delay after using the urgency of 
consolidation to block Petitioner’s emergency hearing.

19. This pattern demonstrates a tactical attempt to manipulate both courts’
dockets to prevent me from obtaining a timely hearing on Petitioner’s properly 
filed emergency motion. It’s a shell game played with the children’s welfare as 
the prize. This Court should not allow itself to be used as an instrument in such 
procedural gamesmanship, particularly when it involves a failure to perform a 
ministerial duty required by law and when children’s welfare is at stake. 
IV. CONCLUSION
This Court’s refusal to hear Petitioner’s properly filed motion constitutes a 
failure to perform a ministerial duty for which there is no adequate remedy 
by appeal. The proper legal procedure requires a motion to transfer to be 
filed and granted before any motion to consolidate can be considered, and by 
answering the SAPCR petition in this Court, Respondent submitted to this 
Court’s jurisdiction. 
The children who are the subject of this proceeding are suffering 
immediate and ongoing harm while procedural issues remain unresolved. Each 
day that passes without addressing the emergency concerns raised in Petitioner’s 
TRO is a day of certain damage to the children’s psychological well-being and 
development. 
Petitioner once heard it said that the true measure of a society is found in 
how it treats its most vulnerable members. By that measure, the procedural 
labyrinth that has prevented this Court from hearing Petitioner’s emergency

motion speaks volumes about how far we have strayed from the ideal of justice. 
The children— innocent, vulnerable, and deserving of the Court’s protection—
have instead become collateral damage in a game of procedural chess. 
Petitioner provides this petition not out of anger or vindictiveness, but out 
of that quiet, heavy disappointment that settles in a person’s bones when they’ve 
done everything by the book only to find the book itself has been shelved away. 
Petitioner followed the rules. He reiterates that he honored the procedures. He 
placed his faith in a system that promised justice would flow like water, clear and 
unobstructed, to those who seek it properly. 
Petitioner asks this Court to remember that behind every case number, 
behind every filing, behind every procedural rule, there are often real children 
with real lives that continue whether the courts act or not. Time doesn’t stop for 
them while adults sort out procedural disagreements. They grow, they hurt, they 
form memories and impressions that will shape them for a lifetime. 
As Mark Twain might have observed, the difference between justice 
served and justice delayed is the difference between a father’s presence and his 
absence, between children thriving and children suffering, between following the 
law and merely gesturing toward it.
