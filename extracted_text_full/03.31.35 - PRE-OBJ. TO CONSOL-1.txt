NO. 322-744263-23 
IN THE 322nd DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
 
 
TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THIS COURT: 
Charles Dustin Myers (“Respondent”), acting pro se, files this Objection to the 
attempted consolidation of the newly filed Suit Affecting Parent-Child Relationship 
(SAPCR) (Cause No. 233-765358-25) with the above-numbered case, and moves for 
declaratory relief regarding the existing orders and for dismissal of the dormant divorce 
action for want of prosecution. In support, Respondent shows the Court the following 
unopposed facts and demonstrates that consolidation would perpetuate procedural abuses, 
violate the children’s best interests, and deny due process. Respondent further provides 
legal authority under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, Texas Family Code, and 
controlling case law to support the relief requested. The detriment to the children that has 
been ongoing cannot continue to be disregarded simply because the Respondent is pro-se.

TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THIS COURT:

Charles Dustin Myers (“Respondent”), acting pro se, files this Objection to the
attempted consolidation of the newly filed Suit Affecting Parent-Child Relationship
(SAPCR) (Cause No. 233-765358-25) with the above-numbered case, and moves for
declaratory relief regarding the existing orders and for dismissal of the dormant divorce
action for want of prosecution. In support, Respondent shows the Court the following

violate the children’s best interests, and deny due process. Respondent further provides
legal authority under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, Texas Family Code, and
controlling case law to support the relief requested. The detriment to the children that has

I. STATEMENT OF FACTS 
A. Ongoing Harm to the Children  
1. The two children of the parties are suffering ongoing and severe harm due to 
Petitioner’s actions. They are being subjected to psychological manipulation and 
medical neglect by Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, resulting in deteriorating mental 
health and emotional wellbeing. For instance, the children are being gaslighted by 
Petitioner into the false belief that the divorce case has already been finalized, causing 
confusion and distress. These allegations – including psychological harm, medical 
neglect, emotional alienation, and academic decline – are well-documented in exhibits 
previously provided to Petitioner’s counsel. To date, neither Petitioner nor her counsel 
has refuted or even responded to these serious charges of ongoing harm to the children. 
 
 
 
B. Children Left in Unsafe Conditions
2. Petitioner has repeatedly left the young children home alone at night without 
any adult supervision. This creates an obvious and unacceptable safety risk. Respondent 
has raised this issue, yet Petitioner and her counsel have offered no denial or explanation. 
At present, the children have been removed from Respondent’s daily care and placed with 
their elderly great-grandparents. This abrupt change in living situation occurred after 
Respondent – their father – was unlawfully locked out of the family home on March 6, 
2024. Since that date, Respondent has been prevented from accessing his home and 
caring for the children, disrupting the only stable parenting they have known.

I. STATEMENT OF FACTS

A. Ongoing Harm to the Children

1. The two children of the parties are suffering ongoing and severe harm due to
Petitioner’s actions. They are being subjected to psychological manipulation and
medical neglect by Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, resulting in deteriorating mental
health and emotional wellbeing. For instance, the children are being gaslighted by
Petitioner into the false belief that the divorce case has already been finalized, causing
confusion and distress. These allegations — including psychological harm, medical
neglect, emotional alienation, and academic decline — are well-documented in exhibits
previously provided to Petitioner’s counsel. To date, neither Petitioner nor her counsel

has refuted or even responded to these serious charges of ongoing harm to the children.

B. Children Left in Unsafe Conditions

2. Petitioner has repeatedly left the young children home alone at night without
any adult supervision. This creates an obvious and unacceptable safety risk. Respondent
has raised this issue, yet Petitioner and her counsel have offered no denial or explanation.
At present, the children have been removed from Respondent’s daily care and placed with
their elderly great-grandparents. This abrupt change in living situation occurred after
Respondent — their father — was unlawfully locked out of the family home on March 6,
2024. Since that date, Respondent has been prevented from accessing his home and

caring for the children, disrupting the only stable parenting they have known.

3. Respondent’s exclusion from the home and the children’s lives was done under 
color of “current orders” that Petitioner obtained in the divorce action. Those orders were 
procured through facially inconsistent and procedurally improper pleadings, as 
detailed further below. Petitioner’s unilateral actions have caused Respondent significant 
harm: he has suffered approximately $110,500 in verifiable financial damages due to 
the unlawful lockout, loss of use of the residence, and the interruption of his parent-child 
relationship. This damage continues to accrue as the Respondent remains barred from his 
home and from normal contact with the children. Opposing counsel and Petitioner have 
been provided financial records and business earnings showing these damages, yet have 
provided no response or acknowledgement of these damages. 
D. Facially Void and Inconsistent Orders 
4. The “current orders” governing possession of the children were obtained by 
Petitioner through pleadings and procedures that are facially inconsistent and legally 
inadequate. On their face, the orders claim consent of all parties yet only bear the 
signatures of the Petitioner and her Counsel. These orders were entered despite clear 
consent being absent, which in effect has dismantled the prior status quo for the 
children under the guise of these questionable orders, even though Respondent contends 
– and will demonstrate – that these orders have no valid legal effect. Neither Petitioner 
nor her counsel has offered any substantive response or justification for the 
inconsistencies surrounding the creation of these orders, effectively conceding the issue 
by silence.

E. Children’s Best Interests Thwarted

5. Since obtaining these dubious orders, Petitioner has actively alienated the 
children from Respondent and deprived them of the stable, loving care he consistently 
provided since birth. The eldest child’s academic performance has plummeted, and both 
children are emotionally estranged from both parents – a direct result of Petitioner’s 
interference with Respondent’s access and her neglect of the children’s emotional needs. 
Petitioner’s actions have upended the children’s best interests, which under Texas law 
should be the paramount consideration in any proceeding involving minors. Respondent 
has fought tirelessly for over a year to restore stability and to protect the children, but 
those efforts have been stymied by procedural delays and Petitioner’s lack of cooperation. 
F. Procedural History and Counsel’s Inactivity 
6. The underlying divorce case has languished without prosecution for over a 
year. Petitioner’s attorney of record, Cooper L. Carter, effectively abandoned the case 
after April 24, 2024. On that date, Ms. Carter filed a Motion for Pre-Trial Conference – 
the last action she took in this matter until very recently. In the eleven months following 
that filing, Ms. Carter filed no pleadings, made no court appearances, and utterly failed to 
advance the case toward trial or resolution. During this period of dormancy, Respondent 
(pro se) repeatedly sought relief to address the children’s situation, yet Ms. Carter never 
filed a single objection, response, or argument to counter Respondent’s motions or 
requests for relief. Serious and well-documented allegations – including child 
endangerment and de facto custody interference – went completely unanswered by 
Petitioner and her counsel for over a year.

after April 24, 2024. On that date, Ms. Carter filed a Motion for Pre-Trial Conference —
the /ast action she took in this matter until very recently. In the eleven months following

endangerment and de facto custody interference — went completely unanswered by

Petitioner and her counsel for over a year.

G. Failure to Engage in Discovery — Deemed Admissions

=== PAGE 5 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---

7. During the divorce litigation, Respondent properly served Petitioner with 
written discovery, including Requests for Admissions under Texas Rule of Civil 
Procedure 198. Petitioner’s counsel failed to respond or object to these Requests for 
Admissions within the time required by law, resulting in those matters being deemed 
admitted by operation of law. Thus, critical facts are conclusively established against 
Petitioner – for example, facts regarding the children’s neglect and the lack of a final 
divorce decree may have been admitted, converting marital assets, and fabricating family 
violence – further prejudicing Petitioner’s position. Despite the grave effect of these 
deemed admissions (which have been pointed out to Ms. Carter), she made no effort to 
withdraw or amend them and filed no responses whatsoever, effectively conceding their 
truth. 
H. Rule 11 and Rule 237a Violations 
8. Throughout the litigation, there has been no valid Rule 11 agreement filed that 
would excuse Petitioner’s obligations or justify the prolonged inaction. Any suggestion of 
an agreed status quo or private arrangement is refuted by the absence of a signed writing 
or on-record agreement (as required by Tex. R. Civ. P. 11). Moreover, Respondent 
removed the case to federal court to seek protection of his rights. The case was later 
remanded to this Court, but Petitioner’s counsel failed to comply with Tex. R. Civ. P. 
237a upon remand. Specifically, counsel did not file the required certified copy of the 
federal remand order with the clerk and did not provide Respondent with the mandatory 
written notice of the remand. Ms. Carter’s neglect of this basic procedural duty prevents 
the case from moving forward to a final trial setting and further exemplifies her lack of 
diligence.

I. Challenge to Counsel’s Authority (Rule 12) 
9. Given Ms. Carter’s persistent non-communication and inaction, and that all 
pleadings filed in this matter have been on her behalf by a non-party,  Respondent filed a 
motion under Tex. R. Civ. P. 12 challenging whether Ms. Carter truly has authority to 
represent Petitioner and clear up the ambiguity surrounding her representation. Ms. 
Carter has not meaningfully corresponded with Respondent at all during the litigation – 
she is unreachable by phone or email, is not properly registered for e-filing 
notifications on the re:SearchTX platform, and even lacks a current working phone 
number or email on file with the State Bar of Texas. Such a complete breakdown in 
participation raises the question of whether Petitioner has been informed or is even aware 
of the current status of the case given the children are being told the divorce is finalized. 
Respondent’s Rule 12 motion puts Ms. Carter to the burden of proving her authority to 
act; tellingly, in the 14 months of litigation Ms. Carter has yet to produce any client 
authority or engagement, and she ignored the Rule 12 challenge just as she ignored 
every other filing. Under these circumstances, Respondent asserts Ms. Carter may no 
longer be authorized to represent Petitioner’s interests – if she ever was – and that her 
filings should be stricken if she cannot promptly show authority as required by law. 
Respondent is under no obligation to set any matter for hearing because doing so would 
waive her obligations to fulfill rule 237a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. 
J. Sudden Appearance to Block Emergency Relief

resurfaced only when Respondent sought emergency relief for the children in a new 
proceeding. In March of 2025, Respondent, desperate to address the children’s worsening

situation, filed a new SAPCR in the 233rd District Court (Cause No. 233-765358-25) 
and obtained a hearing setting for an emergency Temporary Restraining Order to protect 
the children. The very first involvement by Ms. Carter since April 2024 was to appear at 
the eleventh hour in the 233rd District Court and object to the TRO hearing 
through a phone call without ever responding to the TRO or arguing against it. 
Simultaneously, she filed a Motion to Consolidate the new SAPCR case back into the old 
322nd District Court divorce case – a case that has been dormant and effectively stalled 
under void orders. In doing so, Ms. Carter offered no substantive rebuttal to any of 
Respondent’s factual allegations (1–9 above). She provided no explanation for her 
prolonged absence or her client’s failures and inconsistencies, and no justification as to 
how consolidation would serve the children’s best interests. Her sole aim appears to 
be procedural: to drag the new child-focused case into the moribund divorce proceeding, 
effectively keeping the children in legal limbo and delaying any real relief. 
K. No Opposition on the Merits 
11. Over the 14 months of litigation, Petitioner and Ms. Carter have never filed 
a single pleading addressing the merits of Respondent’s claims or the children’s needs. 
They have not objected to evidence, not answered discovery (beyond the deemed 
admissions), not responded to motions, and not presented any competing evidence or 
legal argument. Their pattern is one of total silence on substance, interrupted only by a 
procedural maneuver to avoid a hearing. This stands in stark contrast to Respondent’s 
detailed filings and evidence chronicling the children’s plight. Accordingly, the factual 
allegations enumerated above stand unopposed and uncontroverted in the record of 
both the 322nd and 233rd District Court matters. The Court “cannot continue to ignore”

these undisputed facts, as they demand urgent action for the sake of the children’s 
welfare. 
L. Urgency of Relief 
12. As repeatedly stated - every day that passes without corrective action is a day 
in which the children remain in an unstable, harmful environment. Respondent has 
relentlessly pursued lawful avenues to restore the prior stable status quo for the children, 
only to be met with procedural stonewalling. It would be highly prejudicial to reward 
Petitioner and her counsel’s negligence and gamesmanship by allowing further delay 
through consolidation. Indeed, to do so would blatantly disregard Respondent’s rights 
and, more importantly, the children’s best interests. The time has come for the Court to 
recognize that Petitioner’s counsel – despite holding a law license – has forfeited any 
entitlement to deference through her conduct. Respondent’s self-represented status should 
no longer serve as an excuse to deny or defer relief that the children so desperately need. 
These facts provide the factual foundation for Respondent’s objections and requests for 
relief. With these unchallenged facts in mind, Respondent now turns to the legal reasons 
why consolidation must be denied, the prior orders declared void, and the dormant case 
dismissed, in order to protect due process and the best interests of the children. 
II. VOIDNESS OF THE CURRENT ORDERS 
13. The “Current Orders” Were Improperly Obtained and Are Void for Lack of 
Consent and Inconsistent Pleadings. The orders under which Petitioner has been 
operating – specifically those used to exclude Respondent from the home and curtail his 
possession of the children – are fundamentally flawed and void. It appears these orders

possession of the children — are fundamentally flawed and void. It appears these orders

were presented to the Court as agreed or uncontested, yet the record reflects that 
Respondent never gave knowing consent to any such final settlement. Under Texas law, 
any judgment based upon a purported agreement of the parties requires “unequivocal 
consent at the time of rendition”, and if a party withdraws consent before the judgment is 
rendered, the judgment is void. See Burnaman v. Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 (Tex. 
1951) (holding that when a trial court has knowledge that one party does not consent to a 
judgment, it is error to render a judgment purportedly by agreement; such a judgment is a 
nullity). Likewise, Padilla v. LaFrance, 907 S.W.2d 454 (Tex. 1995) confirms that a trial 
court cannot render an agreed judgment after a party has withdrawn consent to a 
settlement. In short, if one party withheld or withdrew consent, the only method to 
resolve the dispute is a trial on the merits, not entry of an “agreed” order. 
14. Here, the facial inconsistencies in Petitioner’s pleadings and the circumstances 
of how the orders were procured leave no room for logic that he would agree to his 
children’s and his own detriment. Respondent has actively opposed the terms that locked 
him out of his home and separated him from the children. Petitioner misrepresented to the 
Court that an agreement existed alongside her counsel and it was rendered without 
consent. Such an order is void ab initio under the Burnaman and Padilla line of cases. 
Any decree or order dividing rights or restricting Respondent that was entered without a 
proper hearing or true agreement violates Respondent’s due process rights and cannot 
stand. Respondent seeks a declaratory judgment from this Court that any orders 
affecting conservatorship, possession, or property division that were not rendered 
after a valid hearing or with proper consent are void and of no legal effect. This 
declaration is necessary to clarify the parties’ legal position and to remove the cloud of

these improper orders from the case, and immediately restore his right to his residence 
pending a hearing on the merits to satisfy the best interests of the children. 
B. Lack of Judicial Adoption (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.013) 
15. Even if Petitioner’s claim for consent somehow survives despite the absence 
of Respondent’s signature – they remain facially void because they were issued by an 
Associate Judge and never properly adopted or signed by the referring District Court. 
Under Texas Family Code § 201.013(b), if no timely request for a de novo hearing is 
filed after an associate judge’s proposed order, that proposed order “becomes the order 
of the referring court only on the referring court’s signing” the order. In this case, 
there is no record that the 322nd District Court Judge ever signed or entered a final order 
adopting the Associate Judge’s recommendations regarding custody or property. If the 
District Judge did not sign an order, then no final order exists – the associate judge’s 
ruling, while perhaps enforceable interim, never achieved the status of a final judgment 
of the court and has no legal effect. 
16. This may explain why the Texas OAG attempted to intervene in June of 2024 
and has since disappeared from pursuing relief. 
17. Therefore, they should be declared void or vacated due to the lack of proper 
adoption, lack of findings, and for the continuous and irreparable harm they continue to 
inflict on the children and Respondent. 
 
 
 
C. No “Final Order” Rendered – No CEJ in the 322nd Court

adopting the Associate Judge’s recommendations regarding custody or property. If the
District Judge did not sign an order, then no final order exists — the associate judge’s
ruling, while perhaps enforceable interim, never achieved the status of a final judgment

of the court and has no legal effect.

16. This may explain why the Texas OAG attempted to intervene in June of 2024

and has since disappeared from pursuing relief.

17. Therefore, they should be declared void or vacated due to the lack of proper
adoption, lack of findings, and for the continuous and irreparable harm they continue to

inflict on the children and Respondent.

C. No “Final Order” Rendered — No CEJ in the 322nd Court

18. Critically, because of the above defects, no final order has ever been
rendered in the divorce case concerning the parent-child relationship (or the divorce

itself). Texas Family Code § 155.001(a) provides that a court acquires continuing, 
exclusive jurisdiction (CEJ) over child matters “on the rendition of a final order” in a 
suit affecting the parent-child relationship. Conversely, § 155.001(d) states: “Unless a 
final order has been rendered by a court of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction, a 
subsequent suit shall be commenced as an original proceeding.” 
19. In this case, the 322nd District Court never rendered a final order resolving 
the SAPCR or divorce – the orders in place are interlocutory and void. Therefore, the 
322nd never acquired continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the children, and the new 
SAPCR Respondent filed in 2025 was properly “commenced as an original 
proceeding” under § 155.001(d). This point cannot be overstated: there is currently no 
valid final judgment in the divorce case. The divorce remains unadjudicated and the 
parent-child issues remain unresolved by any final decree. Petitioner’s counsel’s 
insistence that the new SAPCR must be consolidated into the divorce case (as if that 
court had dominant jurisdiction) misstates the law. Because no final order exists, the 
233rd District Court is not barred from proceeding with the SAPCR. In fact, the Family 
Code explicitly allows a new original suit in these circumstances.  
20. Respondent had every right to file a new petition to protect his children when 
it became clear the old case was mired in procedural limbo. Accordingly, this Court 
should declare that the prior orders have no legal effect and confirm that the 322nd 
District Court lacks continuing jurisdiction due to the absence of any final order. This 
declaratory relief will clarify that the new SAPCR case may proceed on its own merits, 
unencumbered by the baggage of the defunct divorce proceeding that remain a one-sided 
case with no ability to reach final trial, as explained above.

III. OBJECTION TO CONSOLIDATION 
21. Respondent unequivocally objects to the consolidation of the new child 
custody case (SAPCR) with the dormant divorce case and asks this Court to deny any 
such motion to consolidate. Consolidation at this juncture would be illogical, prejudicial, 
and contrary to Texas law and equity. The following legal grounds support sustaining 
Respondent’s objection: 
A. The First-Filed Divorce Case Does Not Have “Dominant Jurisdiction”  
22. Generally, when two suits involving the same subject matter are pending in 
different courts of equal jurisdiction, the court in which the suit was first filed has 
dominant jurisdiction and the latter is typically abated. See Wyatt v. Shaw Plumbing Co., 
760 S.W.2d 245, 247 (Tex. 1988) (citing Cleveland v. Ward, 116 Tex. 1, 285 S.W. 1063 
(1926)). However, Texas law recognizes critical exceptions to the “first-filed” rule. The 
Texas Supreme Court in Wyatt reiterated three well-established exceptions: “(1) conduct 
by a party that estops him from asserting prior active jurisdiction; (2) lack of persons to 
be joined if feasible; and (3) lack of intent to prosecute the first lawsuit.” (quoting V.D. 
Anderson Co. v. Young, 101 S.W.2d 798 (Tex. 1937); Curtis v. Gibbs, 511 S.W.2d 263 
(Tex. 1974)). If any of these exceptions apply, the court with the first filing does not have 
dominant jurisdiction, and the second court may proceed. Wyatt, 760 S.W.2d at 248.

Petitioner’s and Ms. Carter’s conduct in the divorce case.

24. Petitioner’s actions (through her counsel) should estop her from claiming the 
benefit of the first-filed divorce case. She allowed that case to become completely 
dormant and failed to notify the Court or Respondent of the case’s status after the federal 
remand. By failing to comply with Rule 237a’s notice requirements and effectively 
concealing the revival of the state case from proceeding on the merits, consolidation is 
inappropriate without some form of input from the opposing side. 
25. Petitioner’s counsel also did nothing to set hearings or trial, effectively 
representing that she had abandoned the case. Petitioner cannot now, at the last minute, 
resurrect that case to block a new one – equity and fair play will not permit a party to 
sleep on her rights and then use the prior filing as a weapon. Petitioner’s conduct is 
precisely the kind that warrants estoppel from asserting dominant jurisdiction. 
C. Lack of Intent to Prosecute the First Suit 
 
26. Perhaps the most glaring exception is the third exception. Petitioner 
demonstrated a “lack of intent to prosecute the first lawsuit.” Young, 128 Tex. at 636-37, 
101 S.W.2d at 800-01; see also Curtis, 511 S.W.2d at 267. For nearly a year, she took no 
action to advance the divorce. No discovery, no responses, no settings – nothing. Such 
extended inaction is tantamount to an intention not to pursue the case at all. Texas courts 
have found that when a first-filing party shows no real intent to prosecute their case, a 
second case can proceed notwithstanding the first-filed rule. See, e.g., Wyatt, 760 S.W.2d 
at 248 (recognizing lack of intent to prosecute as an exception).

opportunistic and belated move underscores that Petitioner’s interest lies not in diligently 
prosecuting her first suit, but in obstructing Respondent’s efforts elsewhere. The first case 
was effectively dead on the docket; there was no genuine intent to prosecute it until 
Respondent’s new filing prompted a defensive response. This swift action was done 
solely to avoid accountability from the court that the Respondent has diligently exposed 
without argument. 
 
28. Because of these exceptions, the 322nd District Court cannot be said to have 
dominant jurisdiction. Petitioner forfeited any priority through her own lack of diligence. 
Therefore, there is no legal basis to consolidate the new case into the old one; the usual 
policy of avoiding conflicting jurisdictions must yield to the reality that the first case was 
moribund and is rife with procedural defects. Indeed, the 233rd District Court (new 
SAPCR) is the appropriate forum to hear the current disputes because that case was 
initiated specifically to address the children’s urgent needs, free from the entanglements 
of the stalled divorce. 
 
29. The only counter argument anticipated by the opposition is that the fingers 
will point towards the undersigned, which is nothing more than an excuse for failure to 
participate in Respondent’s quest seeking relief at every available opportunity to advocate 
for his children. Surely a licensed attorney could put forth a legal argument against an 
unruly pro-se litigant – yet here – there exists only silence.

Tex. R. Civ. P. 174(a) permits consolidation of actions involving common questions of 
law or fact, but only “to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.” Here, consolidation would do 
the opposite – it would inflict further delay and costs and gravely prejudice the children’s 
welfare. The new SAPCR was filed to obtain immediate relief (such as restraining orders 
or modified custody) to protect the children. That relief has already been delayed by 
Petitioner’s maneuver; consolidating into the divorce would likely cause weeks or 
months of additional delay as the tangle of the divorce procedure is sorted out (especially 
if the Court must resolve questions about void orders, jurisdiction, or counsel’s status in 
that case). 
31. The best interests of the children is the “primary consideration” in any 
proceeding affecting them. Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002. It is patently not in the children’s 
best interest to postpone substantive relief on issues of their safety and wellbeing so that 
an old divorce action can be resurrected. The children should not be made to suffer 
further harm just because Petitioner’s counsel neglected her duties for a year. 
Consolidation would effectively reward Petitioner for her neglect – she would succeed 
in further delaying a reckoning on her harmful conduct, all while the children remain in a 
detrimental situation. Such an outcome would be unjust.

A. Failure to Respond and Show Authority (Tex. R. Civ. P. 12) 
33. As described, Respondent has challenged Ms. Carter’s authority to act on 
Petitioner’s behalf by motion under Rule 12 in September of 2024. To date, Ms. Carter 
has not responded to this challenge. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12 requires an 
attorney, upon such a motion, to prove her authority to act for the client or else be barred 
from further participation. When an attorney fails to appear or fails to carry this burden, 
the court “shall” strike the attorney’s pleadings and bar her from representing the client in 
that case. In TransAmerica Corp. v. Braes Woods Condo Ass’n, for example, a verified 
motion to show authority was granted when a question arose about a corporation’s 
capacity; the trial court dismissed the attorney and struck the pleadings filed without 
proper authority.  
34. Here, Ms. Carter’s complete absence and unavailability strongly suggest she 
may not have her client’s authorization or active direction. It is even conceivable that 
Petitioner herself has not been kept apprised by Ms. Carter, given the lack of 
communication. Respondent requests that the Court require Ms. Carter to promptly 
prove her authority. If she fails, the Court should strike any consolidation motion or 
other pleadings she filed and preclude her from further advocacy in this matter. The 
practical effect would render Petitioner unrepresented – a status Petitioner is effectively 
in already, due to Ms. Carter’s dereliction. While Respondent takes no pleasure in 
Petitioner potentially losing counsel, the integrity of the proceedings demands that only 
duly authorized representatives be allowed to act.

35. Ms. Carter’s neglect of discovery – particularly her failure to answer Requests 
for Admissions – has materially harmed the truth-finding process. By operation of Rule 
198, Petitioner is deemed to have admitted every fact in the Request for Admissions that 
was unanswered. These deemed admissions are dispositive of key issues. Ms. Carter’s 
failure to perform the most basic task of responding to discovery is a violation of her 
duties under Tex. R. Civ. P. 193.2 and 193.5 (to timely amend or respond) and has 
prejudiced her own client’s case. In fact, her inaction practically concedes Respondent’s 
claims and allegations. The Court should treat the deemed admissions as conclusively 
established in considering this Objection and the underlying merits – meaning that, for 
purposes of this objection, Petitioner has admitted the truth of the allegations in Section I, 
and can be admitted as summary judgement evidence, which remains un-opposed and sits 
as the oldest filed motion on this court’s docket. (Filed and Served February 22, 2024). 
Furthermore, the Court should impose sanctions under Tex. R. Civ. P. 215 for the 
discovery abuse, although Respondent’s primary goal is not monetary sanctions but to 
ensure the facts are recognized as admitted due to Ms. Carter’s failure. 
C. Abuse of Process 
36. Ms. Carter’s sudden filing of a Motion to Consolidate after a year of 
dormancy appears to be a textbook example of using legal process for delay and to 
burden an opponent, rather than for a legitimate purpose. Rule 13 of the Texas Rules of 
Civil Procedure forbids filings that are groundless and brought in bad faith or to harass. 
Likewise, Rule 3.02 of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct states that a

Carter allowed an emergency to develop; by reappearing only to procedurally thwart 
Respondent’s TRO in the 233rd, she acted to unreasonably delay the adjudication of the 
emergency. 
37. There was no substantive justification given for consolidation – no claim that 
resources would be saved or justice served – only a tactic to avoid an immediate hearing. 
This conduct comes perilously close to violating Rule 13’s prohibitions on bad-faith 
pleadings and warrants the Court’s scrutiny. Respondent respectfully submits that the

the effect of prolonging the children’s exposure to harm and multiplying litigation for no

(though pro se, Respondent has expended considerable time and resources), or fines 
payable to the Court, or any order deemed just to deter such tactics. At the very least, the 
lack of any substantive merit in the consolidation request should prompt the Court to

custody and safety. Respondent urges that any procedural disputes be resolved forthwith 
so that the focus can return to the children. Or better yet, end this nightmare 
immediately by declaring the current orders void, which resolves the entire suit in 
favor of the children, and causes no harm to the Petitioner.

further delay. This Court has the power to prevent further injustice and harm by swiftly 
granting the un-opposed relief sought by the Respondent which should have been granted 
on March 28, 2025. Every additional day of inaction is a day of potential damage to the 
children’s psyche and development. Respondent respectfully asks the Court to remember 
that the paramount concern is the children’s best interests and their right to a safe, stable 
home – a right which has been denied to them for too long during these procedural 
wranglings. 
V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF 
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Respondent Charles Dustin 
Myers prays that the Court grant the following relief for the reasons set forth above: 
i. 
Deny Petitioner’s Motion to Consolidate the new SAPCR case (No. 233-
765358-25) with the instant divorce case. Instead, allow the SAPCR to 
proceed separately in the interest of justice and the children’s welfare, or 
in the alternative, abate the SAPCR only until such time as this Court 
disposes of the divorce case (as requested below).

children’s psyche and development. Respondent respectfully asks the Court to remember
that the paramount concern is the children’s best interests and their right to a safe, stable
home — a right which has been denied to them for too long during these procedural

wranglings.

V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Respondent Charles Dustin

Myers prays that the Court grant the following relief for the reasons set forth above:

i. Deny Petitioner’s Motion to Consolidate the new SAPCR case (No. 233-
765358-25) with the instant divorce case. Instead, allow the SAPCR to
proceed separately in the interest of justice and the children’s welfare, or
in the alternative, abate the SAPCR only until such time as this Court

disposes of the divorce case (as requested below).

ii. 
Enter a declaratory judgment that any orders entered in this divorce action 
that purported to resolve conservatorship, possession, or property issues 
are void and/or of no legal effect due to lack of proper consent, notice, or 
final adoption by the Court. Specifically, declare that no final order was 
rendered in this cause, that the March 14, 2024 “agreed orders” which 
claim consent despite missing signatures do not constitute a final 
adjudication, and that they cannot be enforced as a final judgment. 
iii. 
Dismiss the divorce action (Cause No. 322-744263-23) in its entirety for 
want of prosecution pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 165a and the Court’s 
inherent authority.  
iv. 
Although a serious step, the Respondent prays that the Court consider 
referring Ms. Carter’s conduct to the appropriate disciplinary 
committee of the State Bar of Texas for investigation. The Court’s 
findings of fact or a simple referral letter could highlight the issues: 
prolonged neglect, failure to follow court rules (Rule 237a, etc.), failure to 
maintain current contact information, and usage of a dormant case to 
obstruct justice. Such a referral may be warranted to protect the integrity 
of the legal process, especially in sensitive family law matters, or in the 
alternative, require a response to this objection. 
v. 
Grant such other and further relief as the Court finds just and proper, 
whether at law or in equity. Respondent also asks that the Court take 
judicial notice of the contents of the court’s file in this cause and (if
