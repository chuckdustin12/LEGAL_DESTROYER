Issues Presented 
 
Issue No. 1: DJ Respondent erred in rendering temporary orders 
affecting the parent-child relationship and for the preservation of 
the property on January 16th, 2024, without notice and hearing 
despite granting both parties a continuance to obtain legal 
counsel, effectively removing a parent from the Children’s lives 
without any reasonable justification. 
 
Issue No. 2: AJ Respondent clearly abused his discretion when 
rendering temporary orders on January 22nd, 2024, for the temporary 
conservatorship of the Children and preservation of property 
without notice and hearing, naming Mother primary joint 
conservator of the Children and awarding Mother the sole use of 
the residency despite no factual basis existing to do so after she 
failed to obtain legal Counsel in time for the hearing. 
 
Issue No. 3: The AJ Respondent further demonstrated an abuse of 
discretion by issuing temporary orders effective until the final 
divorce decree on March 26th, 2024. These orders were predicated 
on an agreed associate judge's report that was substantively void, 
failing to fulfill the procedural standards which the AJ 
Respondent had previously ratified, and that had no foundational 
basis in law or fact and egregiously overlooked the welfare and 
best interests of the Children.

Issues Presented

Issue No. 1: DJ Respondent erred in rendering temporary orders
affecting the parent-child relationship and for the preservation of
the property on January 16°, 2024, without notice and hearing
despite granting both parties a continuance to obtain legal
counsel, effectively removing a parent from the Children’s lives

without any reasonable justification.

Issue No. 2: AJ Respondent clearly abused his discretion when
rendering temporary orders on January 22™, 2024, for the temporary
conservatorship of the Children and preservation of property
without notice and hearing, naming Mother primary joint
conservator of the Children and awarding Mother the sole use of
the residency despite no factual basis existing to do so after she

failed to obtain legal Counsel in time for the hearing.

Issue No. 3: The AJ Respondent further demonstrated an abuse of
discretion by issuing temporary orders effective until the final
divorce decree on March 26th, 2024. These orders were predicated
on an agreed associate judge's report that was substantively void,
failing to fulfill the procedural standards which the AJ
Respondent had previously ratified, and that had no foundational
basis in law or fact and egregiously overlooked the welfare and

best interests of the Children.

DJ Respondent erred in rendering temporary orders affecting

granting of a temporary injunction for the preservation of the 
property and protection of the parties as deemed necessary and 
equitable.” Id § 6.502(a). 
  DJ Respondent abused his discretion by awarding the mother

from his residency that he needs to provide for the Children 
without notice and hearing on multiple occasions.  
Throughout these proceedings – the clerk’s record will

for his Children’s best interests, and the lack thereof by 
Counsel and both Respondents, entitling the Father to

IV.  
CONCLUSON 
The initial decision by DJ Respondent laid a flawed 
foundation, affecting all later decisions and disregarding the 
children's best interests. AJ Respondent's actions of 
exacerbating and the drafting of an agreed order by incompetent 
counsel merely perpetuated these errors, using the father's 
pursuit of relief as leverage. This process effectively excluded 
a dedicated parent from his children's lives, only to 
conditionally re-admit him, while simultaneously allowing the 
Mother to temporarily remove them from their own home. This 
cascade of decisions represents a stark abuse of judicial 
discretion and a failure of legal duty, highlighting the urgent 
need for rectification to uphold the integrity of the family law 
system and protect the children's welfare. The benefits of the 
Father’s restoration to the family home and place of business, 
and the restoration to his daughter’s lives outweighs the effects 
put on the Mother, as her actions have disregarded the Children’s 
best interests and have casted a long shadow on their future as 
the current situation stands.

Mother to temporarily remove them from their own home. This
cascade of decisions represents a stark abuse of judicial
discretion and a failure of legal duty, highlighting the urgent
need for rectification to uphold the integrity of the family law
system and protect the children's welfare. The benefits of the
Father’s restoration to the family home and place of business,
and the restoration to his daughter’s lives outweighs the effects
put on the Mother, as her actions have disregarded the Children’s
best interests and have casted a long shadow on their future as

the current situation stands.

Relator notes the absence of a court-reported record for this case, signiﬁcantly 
hindering the ability to provide a verbaƟm transcript of proceedings crucial to this 
mandamus acƟon. Notably, the only witness called during these proceedings was 
the mother, primarily for securing legal fees for the March 14th moƟon for 
reconsideraƟon. This unique circumstance, compounded by the lack of a court 
reporter, accentuates the need for the Court's detailed review of the atached 
appendix. This appendix, containing all relevant documents ﬁled in compliance 
with statutory requirements and unopposed to date, forms the core evidence for 
the Court's consideraƟon. Despite these procedural anomalies, the Relator 
believes the submited documents will suﬃciently support the PeƟƟon for Writ of
