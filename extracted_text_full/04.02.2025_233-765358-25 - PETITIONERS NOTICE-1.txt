IN THE 233RD DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
 
 
TO THE HONORABLE COURT: 
 
Petitioner, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, submits this notice to provide a different 
perspective into the current situation: 
I. BEFORE AND AFTER 
1. This side-by-side comparison illustrates the stark differences in the children’s 
quality of life, parental involvement, and household stability before and after the removal of 
the Father from the family home. It presents a clear, fact-based evaluation of how the familial 
environment, care structure, and overall wellbeing of the children have been significantly 
impacted. Each point demonstrates a substantial decline in stability, support, and morality—
raising urgent concerns about the children’s best interests, safety, and development under the 
current arrangement.

V. ACTIONS

5. The motives can be established from the following actions derived from the clerk’s

record within the pleadings:

MOTHER

Fabricated a narrative of family
violence.

Hired an attorney to defend herself,
not represent the children’s best
interests.

Only communicates with her

extramarital partner.

Convinces the children the divorce is
final so her new relationship appears
morally justifiable.

Has offered nothing of substance

regarding the children.

Asked for sole use of the residency to

pursue her new relationship.

Lied to the court to remove Father to

pursue her new relationship.

FATHER

restore the children’s status quo.

• Lied to the court and falsified her 
indigency, then sticks Father with the 
car payments she claimed to pay for. 
• Financial strain leads to one of the 
vehicles being repossessed, credit 
score plummets. 
• Sat dormant for months only to block 
emergency relief in a separate SAPCR 
suit. 
• Opened a separate SAPCR suit to 
escape the procedurally defunct 
divorce to obtain relief for the 
children. 
 
 
6. All the above can be established through the numerous exhibits that have been 
provided to the opposing side. After nearly twelve months of silence, there has been no 
objection, argument, opposition, or response offered for the exhibits given. More critically, there 
has been no response, opposition, or argument offered regarding the relief being sought from the 
Petitioner, which is simply to return to the residence that he was unlawfully removed from so 
that he can begin rebuilding the status quo of the children. Finally, we compare the benefits 
versus the detriments if granting relief to Petitioner: 
VI. BENEFITS VERSUS DETRIMENTS OF GRANTING RELIEF 
BENEFITS 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
         DETRIMENTS

• The respondent will have to choose 
between her extramarital relationship 
or working towards the divorce.

• Children will have help with 
homework from home and help 
preparing for STAR Testing. 
• The respondent will have to choose 
between co-habitation or reside in an 
alternate residence near-by. 
• Children will have frequent and 
continuous access to both parents. 
 
• Financial damages can be repaired. 
 
 
VII. CONCLUSION 
 
This situation is destructive, and truly a one-sided case. Respondent’s prolonged silence, 
in fact, says everything. Without any arguments or opposition on record, it begs the question as 
to how this situation has been permitted to persist as long as it has. The only drawbacks of 
granting relief fall on the Respondent – and are minor inconveniences at best that can never 
outweigh the benefits that the children would reap if relief were to be granted. All the Petitioner 
asked for in the beginning was time. Now, time has been wasted, and we remain in the same 
spot. The point is – the Mother cannot just fabricate family violence to have Father removed 
from the home – especially when she knew and benefitted from his at-home business operations 
which have since been significantly damaged. Despite all the harm done, the Petitioner is 
confident that it can be repaired, the family  can get back on track, and this process can be 
finalized without sacrificing the stability and well-being of the children that they have been 
accustomed to throughout their lives.
