Angie,
Charles Dustin Myers here, we met in person on March 28th, 2025.
I hope you are doing well.
As you are probably aware, this is an extraordinary matter that warrants immediate attention. Opposing counsel has not
been included in this email exchange given the following facts:
1. She directly influenced emergency proceedings on March 28th, 2025.
 
2. Despite telling this court she could attend a full hearing on the emergency TRO on April 10th, she suddenly became
unavailable until April 24th to hear the improper consolidation motion used to halt the emergency TRO by word of mouth
outside of the courtroom.
3. She has been served with the intention to file mandamus and concurrent prohibition in the 322nd court and has
chosen not to respond.
 4. Including her here would further prejudice the children, who are suffering ongoing harm due to this situation.
I'm reaching out to see if we can get this situation in front of the district judge immediately, because given the
circumstances, I will have no other options than to seek a writ of mandamus tomorrow, April 9th, 2025.
I wanted to ensure he was fully aware of the situation and was given an opportunity to act or respond before I escalated
this matter.
Again, thanks for all of your help, and I hope we can resolve this before too much more time is wasted.
Finally, no response has been provided by the opposing counsel regarding the TRO, or the intent to file mandamus - so it
essentially remains unopposed.
Given the circumstances and the series of events which occurred last week, I hope the court can see now the true nature
of this case, and that the intention from the other side has been to delay and interfere while remaining otherwise silent.
The proper procedure was to first transfer or abate the case, so the fact that an improperly filed motion was used to
subvert justice from an attorney who has been silent for the last 11 months makes this scenario extraordinary.
I wish you a good afternoon.
Respectfully,
Charles Myers

Angie,
I had a quick question about the Judge's request for the removal of the exhibits.
I'm compiling the mandamus record, and must have some way to include them on the docket as they are central to the
issues presented.
Is there a particular reason for this, or is it a redaction issue?
Thanks for any insight.
