C. ARGUMENT
I. Availability of Mandamus Relief
Mandamus relief is available when the Court abuses
its discretion and there is no adequate remedy at law, 
such as by appeal. In re Prudential Ins. Co., 148
S.W.3d  124,  135-36  (Tex.  2004)  (orig.  
proceeding). A  trial  court  has  no discretion in 
determining what the law is or applying the law to the 
facts. Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 840 (Tex.
1992) (orig. proceeding).
The Court may grant temporary relief pending its 
determination of an original proceeding. Tex. R. App. P.
52.10(b) 
Because  a  Trial  Court’s  temporary  orders  are  
not  appealable, mandamus is the appropriate means to 
challenge them.  See Little v.  Daggett,  858  S.W.2d
368  (Tex.  1993)  (orig.  proceeding)).

The decision to disconnect the father from his 
children starkly illustrates judicial oversight, 
further exacerbated by the Father's need to represent 
himself pro se due to inadequate legal representation 
previously. 
By excluding the Father from his operational base, 
the court not only removed a daily caregiver but also 
destabilized the primary financial support system for 
the Mother and the Children. 
This decision seemingly overlooks the comprehensive 
framework intended to guide judicial discretion in such 
matters, a framework well-established in the seminal 
case of Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367 (1976). The 
Holley decision articulates a non-exhaustive set of 
factors specifically designed to assist courts in 
ascertaining the best interest of the child, 
encompassing considerations such as the emotional and 
physical needs of the child, the parental abilities of 
the individual’s seeking custody, and the stability of 
the home environment, among others.

the court not only removed a daily caregiver but also
destabilized the primary financial support system for
the Mother and the Children.

This decision seemingly overlooks the comprehensive
framework intended to guide judicial discretion in such
matters, a framework well-established in the seminal
case of Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367 (1976). The
Holley decision articulates a non-exhaustive set of
factors specifically designed to assist courts in
ascertaining the best interest of the child,
encompassing considerations such as the emotional and
physical needs of the child, the parental abilities of
the individual’s seeking custody, and the stability of

the home environment, among others.

Relator seeks a stay in the proceedings of the trial 
court, including the Temporary Orders rendered on March 
26th, 2024, pending this Court’s determination on 
Relator’s Petition for Writ of Mandamus. Failure to 
grant a stay could further exacerbate the damaged caused 
to the Children’s emotional well-being and will directly 
impact their ability to be provided for, as the Relator 
works out of his home and would need sufficient time to 
transition his services to a new residency while the 
case is pending. Because the trial court entered these

According to the Texas Family Code, if the 60-day

protection, “[t]he petitioner shall attach to the 
petition a copy of each order...regarding the conduct 
alleged in the application or order without regard to 
the date of the order. If a copy of the order is not 
available at the time of filing, the petition must state 
that a copy of the order will be filed with the court 
before any hearing.” Id § 6.405(b). The fact that the 
Mother elected to waive the 60-day waiting period, and 
due to the fact no such order of protection ever 
existed against the Father, no hearing should have ever 
taken place in this case as a copy of the non-existent 
order was never filed with the court, which is a 
requirement before any hearing. 
2. The orders rendered on March 26th fell outside of

The Temporary Orders rendered on March 26th failed 
to meet the procedural requirements outlined in them,

individual other than Dan Bacalis, therefore, 
violates the stipulated procedural requirement, 
rendering the resultant orders intrinsically flawed 
and devoid of legitimacy. 
Further compromising the orders' validity is the 
departure of Dan Bacalis from his position prior to 
this critical task being completed. Since the 
procedural directive was unequivocally tied to his 
participation, his premature termination disrupted 
the process and invalidated the subsequent steps 
taken in his absence. As such, there was a failure 
in compliance with the foundational requirements, 
and any order produced thereafter lacks the requisite 
procedural lineage to be enforceable.

Moreover, the preparation of the typed written

the specified procedural timeframe. This delay not

Given these clear procedural deviations, the orders

Background Report for Case Consolidation

Case Details:

Divorce Case (Cause No. 322-744263-23) in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County, filed on
December 18, 2023.

Protective Order Case (Cause No. 322-744538-23) in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County.

Reasons for Consolidation:

Interconnected Issues:

The divorce case and the protective order case involve overlapping issues concerning family violence
allegations, which are central to the divorce proceedings and directly affect custody and visitation rights.
The protective order case includes allegations of family violence, which are also a pivotal point in the
divorce case in determining the waiver of the standard waiting period for the divorce.

Consistency in Rulings:

Consolidating the divorce and protective order cases would ensure consistency in the court's findings,
particularly regarding any allegations of family violence and their impact on the dissolution of marriage,
custody, and visitation rights.

Judicial Economy:

Hearing both cases together would promote judicial economy by avoiding duplication of legal
proceedings, as both cases are likely to involve similar witnesses, evidence, and legal arguments.

Claims of False Statements:

There have been claims of false statements and perjury related to the protective order, which could have
significant implications for the divorce case. For instance, the claim that the plaintiff intentionally lied
about being unable to pay court fees and made false allegations of family violence to gain an advantage
in the divorce proceedings suggests that a single judge should hear both matters for a clear
understanding of the facts.

APPENDIX

42

=== PAGE 71 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
APPENDIX 43
Copy from re:SearchTX
--- OCR TEXT ---
Evidence of Misrepresentation and False Statements:

Evidence provided suggests that there have been misrepresentations to the court, including the transfer
of funds from the joint account and the plaintiff's interaction with third parties, which could affect both
the protective order and the divorce outcome. The protective order — which was based on claims of
family violence — are entirely baseless as | have no record of family violence, and no evidence from the
Plaintiff has been provided to substantiate these claims.

Landlord-Tenant Relationship:

The eviction case, although not directly related to family law matters, stems from claims and actions that
are deeply intertwined with the divorce and protective order cases, suggesting that the alleged family
violence and the actions of the plaintiff have been used to justify an eviction that coincides with the
timing of the divorce and protective order filings.

Conclusion:

Given the overlapping factual and legal issues in the divorce and protective order cases, consolidation
would serve the interests of justice and efficiency. It would ensure that the court has a comprehensive
understanding of the intertwined nature of the family's circumstances, which is vital for fair and
equitable resolution of these matters. While the eviction case may not be directly consolidated due to
jurisdictional differences, it should be considered in context with the other cases to provide a complete
picture of the ongoing disputes and to keep the best interests of our children intact.

Respectfully submitted,

2. Motion for Consolidation: | have recently filed a motion for consolidation to combine this case
with two others due to their intertwined nature. This motion has been accepted by the court but
not yet ruled upon by the judge. A decision on this matter could significantly impact the
proceedings of this case. The relevant cases that are intertwined are cause numbers: 322-
744263-23 (DIVORCE) and JP01-23-E00102017 (EVICTION).

3. Unfounded Claims in Eviction Suit and Protective Order: Both the eviction suit and the protective
order claims are unfounded. The eviction suit lists the violation of the lease as "granddaughter
divorced" and prematurely references the protective order as a secondary reason for eviction
grounds. Additional time is needed to address these premature and baseless claims. There is no
immediate danger to the Plaintiff, or the children — and has never been any incident of family
violence that has occurred within our home. Attached is a copy of my criminal history obtained
by the Texas Department of Public Safety that highlights my clean record.

4. Time to appropriately answer the divorce: The parent case in the request to consolidate is the
divorce, which | have yet to answer due to the concurrent proceedings (eviction suit and
protective order) which were both filed due to the claims that | possess a history of family
violence, waiving the 60-day period for service and making the timeframe unreasonable —
especially considering the lack of communications from the Plaintiffs — to formulate a plan that
best suits our children’s interests.

5. Lack of Cooperation in Providing Lease Agreement: Despite requests, the Plaintiff has not
provided a copy of the lease agreement necessary for my defense. More time is needed to
acquire these critical documents, especially given the unlawful nature of the eviction.

6. Potential for Amicable Resolution: Given more time to prepare and the pending decision on the
consolidation of cases, there is a potential for a more amicable resolution to be reached. The
intertwined nature of the cases suggests that a holistic approach to resolution may be more
appropriate and beneficial for all parties involved.

Considering the above reasons, continuity is necessary to ensure a fair and just resolution of this matter.
| assure the Court that this request is not for the purpose of delay, but to allow for adequate preparation
and the pursuit of justice.

WHEREFORE PREMISES CONSIDERED, |, SE, respectfully request that the Court grant a
continuance for the protective order case.

Respectfully submitted,

| ask the Court to Order that | not have to give this information or notice of changes in this information
to my spouse. | also ask the Court to keep this information confidential.

12. Property and Debt

Note: It is very important to talk with a lawyer if you or your spouse has a house, land, business, retirement
funds, other valuable property or debi. Geiting advice from a lawyer now can save you time and money in the
long run.

About community property: Texas is a community property state. This means that any new property that either
Spouse gets from the minute they are married until the minute the judge grants the divorce is probably community
property, even if the property is only in one spouse’s name. About separate property: Properly owned by a
spouse before the marriage is that spouse’s separate property. In addition, if either spouse receives a gift, an
inheritance, or a recovery for personal injuries that occurred during the marriage (not including a recovery for lost
wages or medical expenses); it is that spouse’s separate property. There are exceptions to these general rules.
If you have questions talk with a lawyer.

About retirement: Retirement funds (such as 401k, pension, profit sharing, stock option plans and IRAs) eamed

by either spouse during the marriage are usually considered to be community property that can be divided by the

court. This is true even if you or your spouse has not yet retired.

® /f you want the Court to divide retirement funds (other than an IRA), you will need to have the Court sign an
additional form, usually called a “Qualified Domestic Relations Order” (QDRO), to make the division effective.
You should have the QDRO prepared before you go fo court, so the judge can sign it when you finish your
divorce. A QDRO form is not included with this divorce set. You may be able fo get a sample QDRO form
from the employer or retirement fund administrator. If not, you should hire a lawyer to draft the QDRO form.

® /f you use the employer or retirement fund administrator's @DRO form, you should still have a lawyer review it
to make sure you are not giving up important benefits.

Note: if you and your spouse plan to keep your own retirement funds or do not have retirement funds, you do

not need a QDRO.

About debt: A creditor's right to collect a debt is not affected by a divorce decree. So, if the Court orders your
spouse fo pay a debt (such as a mortgage) that is in both of your names buf your spouse doesn't pay it, the
creditor can still seek payment from you. Ask a lawyer how to protect yourself in this situation.

12A. Community Property and Debt

If my spouse and | can agree about how to divide the property and debts we got during our marriage, |
ask the Court to approve our agreement. If we cannot agree, | ask the Court to divide our community
property and debts according to Texas law.

12B. Separate Property

| own the following separate property. | owned this property before | was married or | received this
property as a gift or inheritance during my marriage or | received this property as recovery for personal
injuries that occurred during the marriage (not including any recovery for lost wages or medical
expenses). | ask the Court to confirm this property as my separate property.

(Fill in all lines. If you have no property to list in a particular category, write “none.")

This divorce is intertwined with two additional legal proceedings - an eviction suit (Case No. JP01-23-
E£00102017) and a protective order (Case No. 322-744538-23), both of which are deeply entangled with

The significant third-party influence exerted by individuals named 
 
 and 
 as well as 
our landlord – her Grandmother – who lives next door to us - has critically impacted the Plaintiff's 
decisions and actions in our marital matters and the ongoing divorce proceedings. Notably, 
 a family member, has played an active and concerning role in the process – claiming to be 
her legal representative yet possessing no license to practice law in the state of Texas. 
1. 
 and 
 Influence: 
I possess extensive text and call logs that unequivocally demonstrate the Plaintiff's prioritization 
of 
 and 
 over our family obligations and commitments. These interactions, which 
have been meticulously logged and analyzed, reveal a consistent pattern where the Plaintiff has 
chosen to allocate a significant amount of her time and attention to these individuals, even 
amidst our divorce proceedings. It wasn’t until the discovery and subsequent discussion of these 
interactions that lead to the situation escalating. It is my firm belief that the protective order was 
filed in an attempt to escape responsibility rather than to seek protection, as we have been co-
habiting throughout this process, and joint conservatorship was requested on the original 
divorce petition. 
2. 
 Branthoover's Role: 
 Branthoover's involvement has escalated beyond mere influence to active participation in 
the legal aspects of our divorce. He has notably assisted the Plaintiff in preparing and filing 
divorce papers. 
Critically, under 
 advice, the Plaintiff withdrew $1,600 from our joint bank account without 
my authorization. This unauthorized transaction led to a dire financial situation, with a deficit of 
$800 in our account, resulting in bounced bills and considerable strain on my business 
operations. 
This act of financial maneuvering, advised and facilitated by 
 not only infringed upon our 
mutual financial responsibilities but also breached the trust inherent in our joint financial 
management. It underscores the extent of third-party involvement in our personal and legal 
affairs. 
3.
Communication Breakdown:
Throughout these developments, the Plaintiff has consistently failed to communicate with me
about these significant third-party influences and their implications on our divorce and family
dynamics. This lack of communication has been a major contributing factor to the
misunderstandings and the subsequent escalation of conflict between us.
The involvement of these third parties, particularly the actions taken by 
 
 have
not only influenced the Plaintiff’s decisions but also actively interfered with our joint financial
integrity and the legal process. This has added layers of complexity to an already challenging
situation and has necessitated the presentation of this comprehensive account in the interest of
transparency and fairness in these proceedings.

Deterioration of Parental Responsibility
Since the announcement of our divorce on December 1st, 2023, there has been a noticeable and
concerning shift in 
 parenting responsibilities and her involvement in our children’s
lives. Prior to this date, 
 was an engaged and active parent. However, since the
announcement, her day-to-day interactions with 
 and 
 have noticeably
deteriorated. This change is not only alarming but also detrimental to the well-being and
emotional stability of our children.
 has increasingly prioritized her personal interests, specifically her interactions with
friends, 
 and 
 over her responsibilities as a mother. It has been observed and
documented that she spends an excessive amount of time, estimated to be up to 24 hours per
week, visiting these friends. This extensive time spent away from home has not only reduced her
physical presence in our children's lives but also impacted her emotional availability to them.
More concerning is the complete lack of effort on 
 part to communicate effectively
about the children’s needs, their daily routines, and their emotional well-being since the divorce
announcement. This breakdown in communication is critical, as co-parenting effectively is
paramount for the children's adjustment to the changes in our family structure. The inability or
unwillingness to engage in meaningful dialogue regarding our children’s care is not in their best
interest and is counterproductive to their needs during this challenging time.
5.
Contradicting and False Statements
Throughout the ongoing divorce proceedings, there have been several instances of contradictory
and demonstrably false statements made by 
 which have significantly complicated and
distorted the case. A critical point of contention is 
 claim regarding her inability to pay,
which is incongruent with the financial facts presented. Additionally, her request for the waiver
of the standard 60-day waiting period for divorce, citing an alleged order that found I had
committed family violence, is entirely baseless and untrue.
There is no evidence or record to substantiate claims of family violence in our marriage. In fact,
this assertion directly contradicts my clean record and consistent history of being a caring and
non-violent partner and father. The accusation appears to be a strategic move to gain an unfair
advantage in the divorce proceedings.
Furthermore, 
 actions in filing a protective order, followed by the initiation of an
eviction process, appear to be coordinated attempts to remove me from our family home.
Notably, the eviction notice cited the protective order as a reason, even though the protective
order had not been filed at the time of the eviction notice. This sequence of events points
towards a premeditated strategy to unfairly influence the custody and property aspects of our
divorce.
Given these concerning developments, it is imperative that this counter petition replace the
original. This counter-petition is not just a necessary step to address the false allegations and

No History of Family Violence:

Bank Statements and Financial Transactions:

III. CHILDREN'S WELFARE AND FAMILY STABILITY
The children's welfare remains my primary concern. The Plaintiff's actions, influenced by third parties 
and her unfounded claims, threaten our children's stability and well-being. I advocate for maintaining 
the standard 60-day waiting period for the divorce to provide our children with a stable and gradual 
transition. 
Since the divorce announcement, I have remained an active role in my children’s lives, finding activities 
for us to do together due to their time off from school. Despite all inclusion efforts –

declined to join us on these activities – something the children don’t understand and have taken notice 
to.

priorities in line with her friends.

Considering the current complexities surrounding our divorce proceedings, and with the paramount goal 
of ensuring the best interests and minimal disruption to our children’s lives, I propose the following 
interim custody arrangement: 
1.
Full Custody Arrangement
I propose to take on full custody of our children, 
 and 
 This decision is motivated by the 
need to provide them with a stable and consistent environment, especially during this transitional 
phase of our family's life. My commitment to their day-to-day needs, emotional well-being, and 
continued growth has been and will remain unwavering. 
2.
Co-Habitation in Current Family Home:
Recognizing the importance of maintaining a sense of normalcy for our children, I suggest that we 
continue to cohabit in our current family home. This arrangement will prevent any immediate 
upheaval in the children's living environment, allowing them to retain their sense of security and 
familiarity amidst the ongoing changes, and will afford 
 the opportunity to find full-time 
stable employment, and allow me to continue making rent payments to her grandmother, our 
landlord. This is in the best interest of all parties involved. 
3.
Transition to a New Home

and equally accommodating residence is secured. The aim is to ensure this new home is near our

Conversely, I have remained steadfast in my parental duties, inviting

legal actions, which starkly contradict her claims of fear, suggest an attempt to evade
accountability rather than protect herself from any purported threat.

This motion urgently calls for the Court's intervention to address critical procedural

the Court reconsider all details, weighing the comprehensive scenario presented herein along
with the supporting evidence. I am committed to the highest interests of my children and
family, striving to resolve these matters efficiently and avoid unnecessary judicial expenditure.
This document seeks to unveil the Petitioner’s deliberate misrepresentation and misuse of the
legal system, which has gravely disrupted our children's stability and emotional well-being by
weaponizing the court system.

familial stability, with no desire for counseling or communication, and with no consideration of the timing around
the holiday season, nor any sign of marital discord warranting such a decision leading up to this announcement.

and no desire for counseling, communication, and no consideration for the time of year.
2. Between December 1st, 2023, and December 12th, 2023, all efforts are exhausted in an
attempt to communicate with the Petitioner which lead to the subsequent discovery of an
alarming volume of text messages that were directed towards two individuals –
 and 
 showing a significant level of influence.³ 
3. On December 12th, 2023, After the discovery of the communications between these two
individuals combined with the irrational behavior from the Petitioner during such a
critical time of year, I reached out to the Petitioner’s grandfather via text message.⁴

FRIVOLOUS CLAIMS AND FALSE STATEMENTS
A. EMERGENCY PROTECTIVE ORDER
1. As mentioned above, Petitioner filed for an Emergency Protective Order on
December 14th, 2023. This protective order was denied by the courts. 
2. Due to the fact this order was not granted by the court, one could conclude that
there was not a clear and present danger of family violence.¹ 
B. THE DIVORCE PETITION
1. Petition was filed on 2024-12-18 under an Affidavit of Inability to pay.²
2. The Petitioner's action of filing for divorce under an Affidavit of Inability to pay
three days after transferring $1,576 to herself starkly contravenes the mandates 
set forth in Chapter 10, Section 10.001 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code. This 
section asserts that each claim or legal contention must be warranted by existing 
law or a nonfrivolous argument for the modification of existing law or the 
establishment of new law, and that each factual contention has or is likely to have 
evidentiary support after further investigation or discovery³. 
3. The Petitioner violated Chapter 10, Section 10.001 a second time within the
same document when she intentionally elected to waive the 60-day waiting 
period claiming to have an active protective order against me that found family 
violence had occurred during our marriage⁴ despite being denied such an order
just five days prior on December 14th, 2023.  
5. The final page of the Divorce Petition for service to the Office of the Attorney
General was left unsigned by the Petitioner.

C. EVICTION SUIT
1. The suit was unlawful by nature⁵, as the grounds for eviction were based on
family status, referencing the divorce as well as a protective order that had been 
denied on December 14th, 2023. The suit was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction on 
January 17th, 2024.⁶ 
D. PROTECTIVE ORDER
1. This suit was the second attempt by the Petitioner to have me removed from
the home, which ultimately succeeded. 
2. The claims within this suit mentioned sexually aggressive comments and
threatening behavior. These allegations are materially false, as the Petitioner 
possesses no evidence, and has presented no evidence in relation to these claims 
since the initiation of the suit. Despite this, as video and image evidence will show 
once a fair trial date is set, the Petitioner and I continued to maintain stability at 
our family home and preserved the sense of normalcy that our daughters have 
been accustomed to their entire lives up until January 16th, 2024. 
The Court's decision to remove me from my home and my children’s lives on January 
16th, 2024, albeit preliminary and unjustified, bypassed the safeguarding of the children's 
emotional, psychological, and physical well-being. This oversight is compounded by the 
Petitioner's actions. The juxtaposition of the Court's decision against the backdrop of the 
Petitioner's inattention to the children's needs illuminates a disconcerting disregard for the 
paramount principle that custody determinations should primarily serve the children's best 
interests. The final section of this motion will highlight the procedural aspects of the events 
unfolding between the dates of January 16th, 2024, and February 1st, 2024, and pray the court 
will rectify this situation by restoring the stability to our family by vacating the current 
temporary orders that are in place until a proper investigation can be completed by the courts.

THE PROTECTIVE ORDER HEARINGS 
1. In preparation for the Protective Order hearing on January 16th, 2024, I filed with the
Court an answer to the Protective Order on January 2nd, 2024 as well as two motions – a
motion to consolidate the divorce with the protective order, filed on January 4th, 2024, as
well as a motion of continuance, filed on January 8th, 2024 for the purpose to acquire
counsel due to the complex nature of the case.¹ All three filings were accepted by the
court.
2. On January 16th, 2024, both parties sought additional time to secure legal
representation. Despite not reviewing any evidence, witness testimonies, or documents
related to the motions, and acknowledging the denial of a previous Emergency Protective
Order, the court mandated my departure from our home within four hours. This
decision, unexpectedly made, awarded custody to the Petitioner, overlooking my
concerns about the adverse effects on our children and my work from home. This ruling,
which both parties did not sign, set the case to resume on January 22nd, 2024, to allow
time for obtaining counsel.²
3. Following the court's directive, I relocated to my father's residence in Flower Mound until
the subsequent hearing. During this interval, the Petitioner did not take the initiative to
have the children call once and did not provide any information as to how they were
doing, showcasing her lack of empathy and concern for our children’s well-being and
stability. After incurring substantial expenses to secure representation, I detailed my case
and concerns to my attorney, preparing for the next court appearance.
4. On January 22nd, 2024, the Petitioner chose to seek legal representation just minutes
before the hearing was due to start, indicating a disregard for the process. My lawyer
recommended agreeing to a continuance, thereby extending the period I couldn't work
and impacting our established family dynamics. This resulted in a third hearing being set
for February 1st, coinciding with my birthday, and a second rendition being ordered.³

5. On February 1st, 2024, during the third hearing, the substantive issues I had raised were
not addressed, nor was there any exchange of evidence between our legal representatives. 
Despite the focus of the hearing supposed to be on the protective order, the discussions 
veered into custody and child support matters. My lawyer presented the sole option of a 
temporary return to the family home for 30 days with expanded visitation rights, coupled 
with a child support obligation starting in April. This outcome, which diverged significantly 
from the case's core issues, compelled me to reconsider my legal representation. 
Consequently, I decided to terminate my attorney's services and embarked on drafting this 
motion myself, aiming to bring the court's attention back to the pivotal elements of the case 
that had thus far been neglected while able to legally reside in my home. 
CONCLUSION AND PRAYER 
In conclusion, this motion has laid bare the stark realities and procedural aberrations that have 
marred the essence of justice and due process in the matter of Cause No. 322-744263-23. 
Through the course of these proceedings, it has become abundantly clear that the actions taken 
by the Petitioner, 
, have not only disregarded the welfare and best 
interests of our children but have also illuminated her unfitness as a parent. Her actions speak 
to a pattern of deceit, manipulation, and an unsettling willingness to leverage the judicial 
system for personal vendettas, all at the expense of the emotional and psychological well-being 
of our children. 
The court, in its decisions, inadvertently facilitated this troubling trajectory by removing me, 
, from the lives of our children based on unsubstantiated claims and 
without due consideration of my role as a devoted and stable parent. This oversight has not 
only disrupted the lives of our children but has also significantly impaired my ability to provide 
for them, casting a long shadow over their future stability and welfare. 
Moreover, the conduct of my Counsel involved has further compounded these issues, 
demonstrating a distressing disregard for the intricate dynamics and facts of this case. This has 
culminated in a situation where the paramount importance of the children's best interests and 
the fundamental principles of fairness and justice have been overshadowed by procedural 
missteps and a lack of thorough investigation into the Petitioner's fitness as a parent.

Therefore, it is with a heavy hearted yet unwavering resolve that I implore the Court to take 
immediate and decisive action to rectify these wrongs. Specifically, I respectfully request the 
Court to: 
1. Vacate the existing temporary orders that unjustly removed me from my home and
separated me from my children, restoring the status quo ante until a thorough and
unbiased evaluation of the facts can be conducted, as the Texas Constitution requires. If
left as it stands, these orders will further compound the issues at hand, and will
exacerbate the chaos introduced into the children’s lives.
2. Set a fair hearing date to delve into the substantive issues at hand, ensuring that all
parties are given an equitable opportunity to present their case and that the best
interests of our children are placed at the forefront of all considerations.
3. Scrutinize any response or new claims from the Petitioner or her counsel with the utmost
diligence, given the established pattern of deceitful and manipulative behavior exhibited
by the Petitioner throughout these proceedings.
4. Consider awarding me full custody of our children, ensuring their continued access to a
stable, nurturing environment, and the consistent provision of their needs, which I am
fully committed to upholding. Furthermore, in alignment with my enduring belief in the
importance of both parents in the lives of our children, I pledge to facilitate and
encourage a healthy, constructive relationship between the children and their mother,
provided she demonstrates a genuine commitment to their well-being and stability.
5. In seeking these remedies, I do so not out of vindictiveness but from a place of deep
concern for the welfare of our children and a steadfast belief in the principles of justice
and fairness. Despite the pain and turmoil of these proceedings, my ultimate desire is for
peace and the best possible outcome for all parties involved, most importantly, our
children. It is my sincere hope that the Court will recognize the gravity of the situation
and act in a manner that prioritizes the well-being of our children, ensuring their return
to a life marked by stability and love.
I affirm under penalty of perjury that all claims herein are true and accurate to the best of my

Therefore, it is with a heavy hearted yet unwavering resolve that I implore the Court to take
immediate and decisive action to rectify these wrongs. Specifically, I respectfully request the
Court to:

1. Vacate the existing temporary orders that unjustly removed me from my home and
separated me from my children, restoring the status quo ante until a thorough and
unbiased evaluation of the facts can be conducted, as the Texas Constitution requires. If
left as it stands, these orders will further compound the issues at hand, and will
exacerbate the chaos introduced into the children’s lives.

2. Set a fair hearing date to delve into the substantive issues at hand, ensuring that all
parties are given an equitable opportunity to present their case and that the best
interests of our children are placed at the forefront of all considerations.

3. Scrutinize any response or new claims from the Petitioner or her counsel with the utmost
diligence, given the established pattern of deceitful and manipulative behavior exhibited
by the Petitioner throughout these proceedings.

4. Consider awarding me full custody of our children, ensuring their continued access to a
stable, nurturing environment, and the consistent provision of their needs, which I am
fully committed to upholding. Furthermore, in alignment with my enduring belief in the
importance of both parents in the lives of our children, I pledge to facilitate and
encourage a healthy, constructive relationship between the children and their mother,
provided she demonstrates a genuine commitment to their well-being and stability.

5. In seeking these remedies, I do so not out of vindictiveness but from a place of deep

and act in a manner that prioritizes the well-being of our children, ensuring their return

IN THE 322nd DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY 
STATE OF TEXAS

Cause No. 322-744263-23 
Petitioner, 
v. 
RESPONDENT’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL 
SUMMARY JUDGEMENT 
, 
Respondent 
Pursuant to Rule 166a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure¹, the Respondent,
, firmly seeks a partial Summary Judgment in regard to the upcoming 
hearing scheduled for March 14th, 2024. He categorically asserts that the evidence on file 
with the Court definitively demonstrates there is no genuine issue as to any material fact 
related to the allegations against him which have led to his unwarranted removal from 
his home, significantly disrupted his business operations, and unjustly granted the 
Petitioner full custody of their children and possession of the family home on a 
temporary basis. 
The Respondent has meticulously and persistently contested the baseless allegations of 
family violence that have unjustly prejudiced the custody resolution to the detriment of 
the children's interests. The absence of substantive evidence supporting these claims has 
been made clear through detailed submissions.²  This unwarranted influence on custody 
¹ Rule 166a specifically allows for summary judgment when "the pleadings, depositions, answers to 
interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine 
issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." This 
provision is utilized here to highlight the lack of factual dispute regarding the allegations of family 
violence which have led to the continuation of unlawful temporary orders currently in place. 
² Submissions on record filed by the Respondent: Motion of Continuance (granted), Motion of 
Consolidation (granted), Protective Order Answer (ignored), Counter Petition for Divorce (ignored), 
Motion of Withdrawal for Attorney (granted), Emergency Motion of Reconsideration of Evidence and to 
Vacate Temporary Orders (Scheduled for March 14th, 2024). See attached EXHIBIT A.

RESPONDENT’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL

SUMMARY JUDGEMENT
SS SS

>

Respondent

Pursuant to Rule 166a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure!, the Respond, —
Me firmly seeks a partial Summary Judgment in regard to the upcoming
hearing scheduled for March 14", 2024. He categorically asserts that the evidence on file
with the Court definitively demonstrates there is no genuine issue as to any material fact
related to the allegations against him which have led to his unwarranted removal from
his home, significantly disrupted his business operations, and unjustly granted the
Petitioner full custody of their children and possession of the family home on a
temporary basis.

The Respondent has meticulously and persistently contested the baseless allegations of

family violence that have unjustly prejudiced the custody resolution to the detriment of
the children's interests. The absence of substantive evidence supporting these claims has
been made clear through detailed submissions.2 This unwarranted influence on custody

1 Rule 166a specifically allows for summary judgment when "the pleadings, depositions, answers to
interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine
issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." This
provision is utilized here to highlight the lack of factual dispute regarding the allegations of family
violence which have led to the continuation of unlawful temporary orders currently in place.

2 Submissions on record filed by the Respondent: Motion of Continuance (granted), Motion of

Motion of Withdrawal for Attorney (granted), Emergency Motion of Reconsideration of Evidence and to
Vacate Temporary Orders (Scheduled for March 14", 2024). See attached EXHIBIT A.

arrangements negate the principles of fairness and due process. The subsequent 
dismissal of the Protective Order suit not only vindicates the Respondent but also 
invalidates the current custody orders, revealing that the initial award of custody was 
grounded solely in unsubstantiated claims of family violence.³
BACKGROUND 
The documents on record filed by the Respondent, by virtue of their acceptance, 
inherently meet the threshold for self-authentication, thereby bolstering the legal 
foundation for the requested partial Summary Judgment. Detailed herewith are the 
enumerated facts underpinning this motion:
1. On December 14th, 2023, the Petitioner sought an EX-PARTE Order of
Protection from the Court, which was judiciously denied, affirming the
absence of immediate threat or harm that warranted such an extraordinary
measure. Undeterred by this judicial determination, the Petitioner proceeded
to file for divorce on December 18th, 2023, misleadingly alleging the existence
of an active Order of Protection against the Respondent. This deliberate
misrepresentation constitutes not merely an attempt to skew the legal process
in the Petitioner’s favor but represents a flagrant abuse of the judicial system
designed to secure an undue advantage in the divorce proceedings, which has
ultimately been successful.
2. On December 22nd, 2023, the Petitioner initiated a subsequent application for
a Protective Order, forming the cornerstone of litigation since the initial
hearing on January 16th, 2024.
3. On January 16th, 2024, the Court rendered Temporary Orders which required
the Respondent to vacate his family home and give up custody of his children
on the presumption of family violence. The Court’s decision did not meet the
statutory requirements of the Texas Family Code, Sec. 6.502.⁴
³ The non-suit of the protective order entitles the Respondent to this Partial Summary Judgement as a 
matter of law, as there is now no genuine dispute over the baselessness of the allegations made against 
him which are the foundation of the current temporary orders in place. 
⁴ Sec. 6.502 mandates that a Court may make such a decision while a suit for dissolution of a marriage is
pending and on the motion of a party or on the court's own motion after notice and hearing. No hearing 
took place, and no reasonable notice was given prior to the decision rendered on January 16th, 2024.

4. On January 22nd, 2024, before the start of the reset hearing, the Petitioner
acquired legal counsel at the last minute, delaying the case further until the
reset date of February 1st, 2024.
5. On February 1st, 2024, both parties entered into an agreement which allowed
the respondent back into the home on a temporary basis, yet still awarded the
Petitioner with full custody of the children. The Respondent was given 30 days
per the agreement to remain in the home. Despite having the ability to stay
next door, and after dropping the Protective Suit that initiated and are the
foundation for this agreement, the Petitioner chose to stay with her friend 9
miles away and remove the children from their stable environment.
6. On February 5th, 2024, the Respondent discharged his Legal Counsel for failure
to address any of the issues mentioned herewith, and for failure to diligently
represent the Respondent, as no genuine effort was made to make the court
aware of these errors. The Protective Order suit was non-suited on this day,
invalidating the current agreement, and requiring by law that the Court reset
the case back to the status quo ante until a fair discovery process can be
conducted on relevant matters to the divorce proceeding, and restoring order
back into the lives of the Respondent and his Children.
7. The Petitioner's decision to reside outside the family home, despite alternatives
that would minimize disruption during this transitional period, is a deliberate
choice. This choice, made independently, should not facilitate the continuation
of unfounded claims that have since been dismissed. Such actions have unduly
influenced the living arrangements and well-being of the children at the heart
of this case.
8. The Respondent explicitly refrains from pursuing any sanctions or penalties
against the Petitioner, emphasizing instead a heartfelt plea for a reasonable
transition period. This adjustment period is advocated as crucial for
safeguarding the welfare of his children, himself, and the Petitioner, ensuring
their collective long-term well-being. Furthermore, the Respondent
underscores that the prevailing custody determinations were unjustly
predicated on unsubstantiated allegations of family violence—a point
underscored by the unequivocal dismissal of the Protective Order, which
confirms the absence of any contested material facts.

LEGAL BASIS 
The legal foundation for this Partial Summary Judgment is firmly rooted in the principles 
and mandates of the law, notably where the current temporary orders are predicated on 
unsubstantiated claims of family violence, for which no concrete evidence has been 
presented. This lack of evidence fundamentally challenges the integrity and validity of 
the orders affecting the lives and welfare of the children involved. The necessity for the 
court to vacate these orders and revert to the status quo ante is underscored by the 
following critical legal arguments: 
1 . Misalignment with Texas Family Code Sec. 105.001: 
1.1 The orders issued on January 16th, 2024, and continued on January 
22nd, 2024, starkly conflict with Texas Family Code Sec. 105.001, which 
unequivocally necessitates notice and a hearing prior to the issuance of 
such orders. This statute ensures that parties are given a fair opportunity to 
be heard, a fundamental aspect of due process, which was conspicuously 
absent in this case. 
2. Contravention of Texas Family Code Sec. 105.005:
2.1 The initial rendering of temporary orders on January 16th, 2024, did 
not adhere to Texas Family Code Sec. 105.005, requiring that court's 
findings be grounded in a preponderance of the evidence before making 
any child custody determination affecting the parent-child relationship. 
2.2 The absence of evidence from the Petitioner, juxtaposed with the 
disregard for the Respondent's timely submissions, underscores a 
significant deviation from this legal requirement. 
3. Violation of Texas Family Code Sec. 153.002:
3.1 The proceedings failed to prioritize "The best interest of the child," as 
mandated by Texas Family Code Sec. 153.002. This principle, deemed 
paramount in determining issues of conservatorship, possession, and 
access, was overlooked.

reasonable transition period to maintain his pivotal role in his children’s 
lives were disregarded, further exacerbating the impact of the Petitioner’s 
actions and the court’s decisions on the children’s stability and well-being. 
4. Equal Opportunity and Fair Hearing (Sec. 152.205 & Sec. 105.003):
4.1 The Texas Family Code Sec. 152.205 and Sec. 105.003 enshrine the 
necessity for equitable procedural rights, mandating that all parties are 
granted a fair opportunity for notification and a meaningful hearing. The 
Respondent’s ability to engage fully in the hearing process and to present a 
comprehensive defense was significantly impeded, a deviation from the 
due process envisaged by these statutes. Consequently, the temporary 
orders issued lack the foundational fairness that is central to the justice 
system and contravene the legal safeguards intended to ensure balanced 
participation by all parties in family law proceedings. 
5. Managing Conservatorship Considerations (Sec. 153.005 & Sec. 153.007):
5.1 In deliberations of conservatorship, Texas Family Code Sec. 153.005 
obligates the court to deliberate thoroughly on the child’s best interest, 
including the living circumstances and stability provided by the parents. 
Additionally, Sec. 153.007 advocates for the establishment of a mutually 
agreed parenting plan, prioritizing the child’s welfare and the continuity of 
their established routine. The current custodial provisions do not 
correspond with a collaboratively designed parenting plan that satisfies 
these essential criteria. Given the disproven allegations of family violence 
and the unnecessary protective measures imposed during this period of 
change, it is imperative for the Court to rescind these provisional measures. 
The immediate restoration of the status quo ante is crucial to uphold the 
children’s best interest, allowing for a planned and considerate period of 
adjustment that acknowledges the absence of any immediate risk or harm 
to their well-being and without disruption to the Respondent’s business 
operations at-home. 
6. Rules of Dispositions for Family Law Cases – (Tarrant County Rules):

reasonable transition period to maintain his pivotal role in his children’s
lives were disregarded, further exacerbating the impact of the Petitioner’s
actions and the court’s decisions on the children’s stability and well-being.

4. Equal Opportunity and Fair Hearing (Sec. 152.205 & Sec. 105.003):

4.1 The Texas Family Code Sec. 152.205 and Sec. 105.003 enshrine the
necessity for equitable procedural rights, mandating that all parties are
granted a fair opportunity for notification and a meaningful hearing. The
Respondent’s ability to engage fully in the hearing process and to present a
comprehensive defense was significantly impeded, a deviation from the
due process envisaged by these statutes. Consequently, the temporary
orders issued lack the foundational fairness that is central to the justice
system and contravene the legal safeguards intended to ensure balanced
participation by all parties in family law proceedings.

5. Managing Conservatorship Considerations (Sec. 153.005 & Sec. 153.007):

5.1 In deliberations of conservatorship, Texas Family Code Sec. 153.005
obligates the court to deliberate thoroughly on the child’s best interest,
including the living circumstances and stability provided by the parents.
Additionally, Sec. 153.007 advocates for the establishment of a mutually
agreed parenting plan, prioritizing the child’s welfare and the continuity of
their established routine. The current custodial provisions do not
correspond with a collaboratively designed parenting plan that satisfies
these essential criteria. Given the disproven allegations of family violence
and the unnecessary protective measures imposed during this period of
change, it is imperative for the Court to rescind these provisional measures.
The immediate restoration of the status quo ante is crucial to uphold the
children’s best interest, allowing for a planned and considerate period of
adjustment that acknowledges the absence of any immediate risk or harm
to their well-being and without disruption to the Respondent’s business
operations at-home.

6. Rules of Dispositions for Family Law Cases - (Tarrant County Rules):

Rules, specifically Part 4 concerning the disposition of family law cases,

STATEMENTS OF FACT 
Below are the enumerated statements of fact with no genuine dispute of material fact 
that entitle the Respondent to this Partial Summary Judgement: 
1. The Petitioner has not provided any evidence of Family Violence.⁶ These claims
unjustly removed the Respondent from his home starting on January 16th, 2024
and significantly impaired his at-home business operations, and are the basis for
the current custodial arrangements which are unlawful and founded on false
claims.⁷
2. No basis exists for the current arrangements, as the Court has not considered the
best interests of the children throughout this case, but rather has operated solely
on the accusations of family violence, which are now non-suited.⁸
3. The deadline approaching March 1st to vacate, and the current custodial
arrangements are void of any lawful basis. Any custodial arrangements are
required to consider the best interests of the children involved.
4. Respondent’s parenting plan has been overlooked by the Court, filed January 6th,
2024.⁹
5. The Court’s basis for conservatorship was based solely on the claims of Family
Violence, which are now void.
6. The respondent is entitled to this Partial Summary Judgement as a matter of law,
which will rightfully restore the status quo ante given no genuine dispute of
material fact exists regarding family violence, which are the basis for the ongoing
and current orders.
⁶ There exist no evidence supporting family violence on record, nullifying any custodial arrangements  
based on these foundational claims alone.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, 
, the Respondent herein, respectfully requests this 
Honorable Court to: 
1. Annul the current temporary custody and visitation arrangements premised on
allegations now proven to be baseless, taking into account the critical urgency
imposed by the Respondent’s work-from-home requirements and the ongoing
detriment to his familial relationships.
2. Recognize that the initial accusations of family violence, which underpinned
the imposition of these temporary measures, were not substantiated by
credible evidence. This failure has unjustly prejudiced the Respondent,
undermining his right to an equitable adjudication and rendering the imposed
measures legally untenable.
3. Acknowledge the absence of substantial evidence for the allegations levied
against the Respondent. Command a thorough reevaluation of both procedural
and substantive legal missteps observed in the prevailing proceedings, with a
view to rectifying the inequitable temporary orders that have adversely
impacted the Respondent’s familial and professional life.
4.
In accordance with Rule 166a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule
60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, award relief predicated on
identifiable mistakes, errors, and the conspicuous lack of evidential foundation
for the accusations faced by the Respondent.
5. Uphold Fairness and Due Process: Reorient the ongoing legal process to align
strictly with the principles of fairness, due process, and the paramount
interests of the children involved. This reorientation is essential to ensure the
administration of justice, uphold the Respondent’s inalienable right to a fair
trial, and ameliorate the unwarranted disruptions to his familial life.

EXHIBIT A: TEMPORARY VISITATION ADJUSTMENT PROPOSAL

Respondent: as

Understanding the intricate nature of our family's current situation and the legal complexities involved, |,
BEES, Propose a thoughtful adjustment to the visitation schedule that aligns with our
cohabiting status and the abrupt changes brought about by the divorce announcement.

1. Co-habitation Acknowledgement:

It is acknowledged that both parents currently cohabit, which complicates traditional custody
arrangements. Therefore, the immediate priority is to facilitate a transition where both parties can

establish their respective independent living and working arrangements without disrupting the children's
lives.

2. Transition Period:

GEE Employment: Provide with the necessary support and time to secure stable
employment, which is vital for her to contribute to the children's needs and establish her own residence.

Stable Housing for GE As | seek stable housing to maintain my significant role in our daughters’
lives, flexibility in visitation is essential to ensure | continue to fulfill my parental duties.

APPENDIX 114
Copy from re:SearchTX
--- OCR TEXT ---
3. Work and Research Commitments:

The concurrent legal proceedings, particularly those based on unverified claims, demand a substantial
amount of my time for research and preparation to protect the children's well-being.

My ability to work has been affected by the proceedings, necessitating an adjustment in my day-to-day
routine to accommodate these new responsibilities.

4. Interim Custody Logic:

Continuity for Children: While we navigate these proceedings, it is critical to maintain stability and
continuity for our children. Any temporary custody arrangements should reflect the least disruptive path
for them.

Counseling and Mediation: | strongly advocate for counseling or mediation to reconcile and navigate the
divorce process, emphasizing the children's best interests rather than abrupt and contentious changes.

5. Court's Facilitation:

The court's facilitation in endorsing a temporary and flexible visitation framework is crucial. This
framework must account for the current living situation and the significant emotional and logistical
upheaval that the divorce proceedings have caused.

This proposal is made in the spirit of cooperation, with a focus on minimizing the impact of our marital
dissolution on our children. It is with a sincere hope that we can transition into a stable co-parenting
arrangement that keeps our children's welfare as the priority.

NOTICE AND UNSWORN DECLARATION 
, 
Respondent 
March 3, 2024 
Dear Clerk of the Court, 
This letter is submitted on behalf of the Respondent in the above-referenced case to 
provide the court with an update on the Respondent's efforts to uphold the well-being of 
the children under the current agreed arrangements pending review and to navigate the 
complexities of this case. The following reasons why it is impossible for the Respondent 
to vacate the family home under the current agreement pending review are as follows: 
1. Since the inception of the case, the Respondent's primary focus has been to reset
the status quo ante for the benefit of the children, ensuring their lives remain as
normal and uninterrupted as possible during this transitory period after it was
significantly disrupted beginning on January 16th, 2024. Despite the challenges
posed by the non-suited protective order and the dropped allegations of family
violence which were the foundations of all decisions made within this case, the
Respondent has respected the orders pending review, and has strived to provide a
stable and supportive environment for his children during his designated time, all
while planning a transition that best suits his children.
2. During the short amount of time the Respondent has been re-instated to his home,
the Petitioner has, on multiple occasions, entered the residence unannounced and
without prior consent, actions which stand in stark contrast to her prior requests
for protection which have governed this case.

3. The Petitioner has changed employers since the signing of the agreement.
4. Petitioner has relinquished custody of the children to the Respondent on multiple
days during her scheduled time, showcasing the Respondent’s ability to care for
his children at any time given his at-home work schedule specifically crafted to
ensure participation in every aspect of his children’s lives remains possible.
5. The Respondent must dedicate substantial time to researching and understanding
legal procedures to ensure compliance with court rules and to advocate effectively
for the best interests of his children. He is prepared to present all relevant facts
and evidence at the upcoming hearing on March 14th, should his partial summary
judgment not be accepted.
6. The Respondent has made efforts over the past 30 days to maintain normalcy for
his children, showcasing his dedication to their well-being. The Respondent has
maintained an amicable relationship with the Grandparents residing next-door,
allowing frequent access during his time with the children to visit and attend
church, maintaining normalcy and peace.
7. The choice to remain outside the home is a deliberate decision by the Petitioner
during the transition period. Self-hosting and advertising is an essential
requirement for my at-home operations, which is essential to maintain the quality

ISSUES PRESENTED 
1. Given evidence suggesting that the Petitioner fabricated allegations of
family violence to secure a tactical advantage in custody and divorce
proceedings, does this raise a significant legal question regarding the
adequacy of safeguards against misuse of protective orders, potentially
warranting a review of the court’s reliance on unverified claims in making
preliminary decisions affecting parental rights and access to children?
2. Considering the absence of concrete evidence indicating an immediate
risk of harm or abuse towards the Petitioner or minor children, did the
Court’s initial decision to issue Temporary Orders on January 16th, 
followed by January 22nd, and February 1st—thereby excluding the 
Respondent from the family residence and severing his relationship with 
his children—constitute an abuse of discretion lacking clear evidence of 
danger for such emergency action, ultimately leading to a violation of the 
Respondent’s due process and infringement of constitutional and parental 
rights, while also disregarding the children’s best interests? 
3. How can the Court remove one parent from the home without following
the mandated process required by law, resulting in the destruction of the
status quo of the minor children, and further uphold this decision when
no finding of facts has taken place?

EMPLOYMENT HISTORY AND FAMILY DYNAMICS 
1. Throughout their marriage, both parents have alternated roles as stay-at-
home parents, adapting their employment status to meet the 
developmental needs and schedules of their children, now aged seven and 
five. This arrangement has enabled both the Petitioner and Respondent to 
maintain an active and consistent presence in their children’s lives, 
encompassing not only day-to-day care but also engagement in school 
activities and extracurricular events. This hands-on approach has been a 
testament to their dedication to the well-being and upbringing of their 
children, demonstrating a flexible yet committed stance towards 
balancing family responsibilities with personal and professional 
development opportunities as they arise. 
2. The Couple had lived paycheck to paycheck for most of the marriage, and
things began to look up when the Petitioner acquired a job as a Leasing 
Agent/Consultant near our home. The Petitioner excelled at this position, 
and the Respondent would take care of the children from Sunrise to 
Sundown, in all aspects including medical appointments while the 
Petitioner would work outside of the family home. 
3. The unique situation the Couple had been blessed with put them in a

EMPLOYMENT HISTORY AND FAMILY DYNAMICS

1. Throughout their marriage, both parents have alternated roles as stay-at-
home parents, adapting their employment status to meet the
developmental needs and schedules of their children, now aged seven and
five. This arrangement has enabled both the Petitioner and Respondent to
maintain an active and consistent presence in their children’s lives,
encompassing not only day-to-day care but also engagement in school
activities and extracurricular events. This hands-on approach has been a
testament to their dedication to the well-being and upbringing of their
children, demonstrating a flexible yet committed stance towards
balancing family responsibilities with personal and professional

development opportunities as they arise.

2. The Couple had lived paycheck to paycheck for most of the marriage, and
things began to look up when the Petitioner acquired a job as a Leasing
Agent/Consultant near our home. The Petitioner excelled at this position,
and the Respondent would take care of the children from Sunrise to
Sundown, in all aspects including medical appointments while the

Petitioner would work outside of the family home.

3. The unique situation the Couple had been blessed with put them in a
situation where the children could frequently visit their grandparents next
door, creating a rare and ideal situation for them, also enabling the

Respondent to help generate income by acquiring a part-time Legal

Transcriptionist job from home while the children were in the care of the 
Grandparents. 
4. During May of 2019, the Petitioner was unexpectedly terminated from
her job as a Leasing Agent, where the Couple once more swapped roles as 
the stay-at-home parent, and the Respondent quickly acquired 
employment at Classic Mazda of Denton, starting on July 1st, 2019. 
5. This transition was very difficult, as the Respondent went from seeing his
children every day to sometimes not at all given the hour-long commute 
to work and extraneous hours and was in an entirely new field of work as 
a sales associate. 
6. In the Fall of 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic hit and put the dealership in
a state of uncertainty by significantly reducing the number of patrons 
who would visit the dealership, which impacted the monthly commission 
for the Respondent, creating significant down-time that the Respondent 
took advantage of by self-certifying himself in many areas of the 
dealership.

become the sales solution for the dealership during the COVID-19

8. In November of 2019, the Respondent created a YouTube channel
entitled Charlie and the Mazdas, where he began to use his self-
certification for internet sales to create personalized videos for internet 
clients during the pandemic, allowing them to see the features of their 
desired vehicle from the comfort of their own home. If the client decided 
to move forward, the Respondent would wrap the steering wheels in 
plastic wrap, wash the vehicles himself, and drive them to the client’s 
residence as a courtesy service during the pandemic. 
9. This approach was not only successful but lead to the Respondent
finishing second overall for the Southwest Region of the United States for 
Mazda sales for the year of 2020. 
10. The Couple also leased their first vehicle in November of 2019, which was
a Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring model, machine grey. 
11. As the year 2020 unfolded, the Respondent found himself increasingly
drawn to the stock market. This interest was sparked by the extraordinary 
market conditions of 2020, fueled by the Federal Reserve’s pivotal 
amendments to Regulation D and the Supplemental Leverage Ratio. 
These changes were instrumental in maintaining bank liquidity, enabling 
continued lending to high-risk companies amid the pandemic, presenting

12. By January 2021, inspired by his burgeoning passion for financial
markets—and motivated by a desire to reclaim precious time with the 
Children—the Respondent made a conscientious decision to part ways

commitment to both his family and his growing interest in financial 
markets, setting the stage for a new chapter in his professional and 
personal life since his employment began on July 1st, 2019. 
13. Shortly after starting this new chapter, the Respondent quickly realized
trading was going to be a lot more challenging than he had first realized, 
which lead to the evolution of his YouTube channel, renamed from 
Charlie and the Mazdas to Charlie’s Vids, where he turned his focus to 
SEC law, covering agency filings out of the Options Clearing Corporation, 
National Securities Clearing Corporation, Depository Trust Company, 
Depository Trust Clearing Corporation, FINRA, the Code of Federal 
Regulations, the Office of Financial Research, amongst other market

detailed in paragraph 1 by failing to thoroughly examine the case’s

proceedings. 
3. The opposing Counsel has not conducted any meaningful discovery
in this case to warrant any significant decisions which has 
ultimately damaged the future outlook of the children by awarding 
full custody to the Petitioner for no valid reason. The only 
discovery conducted in this case amounts to financial disclosures 
which have since significantly changed, as the Petitioner has 
changed employment, and the Respondent has been unable to 
work to full capacity since March 6th, 2024. 
4. The Petitioner’s lack of full-time employment raises significant
concerns regarding their ability to meet the financial needs of the 
minor children involved in this case. This issue casts doubt on the 
Court’s decision to grant the Petitioner full custody and exclusive 
access to the family home. The decision, which appears to have 
been made on subjective grounds, preemptively removed the 
Respondent from the home before they had the opportunity to

THE RESPONDENT’S EFFORTS 
1. Due to having failed legal representation, the resources required to
acquire alternative Counsel after the termination of Mr. Bacalis coupled
with the growing dis-trust of the Judicial System as a whole given the
totality of circumstances left the Respondent with having to represent
himself, which is a task he has taken seriously in an effort to advocate for
his daughters in a zealous manner.
2. The Respondent has researched and is aware of the ever-growing burden
pro-se litigants are becoming on the Courts, their staff, and their
resources due to the vast majority of pro-se litigants not putting in the
time or effort reasonably required to represent themselves effectively or
are solely trying to reduce costs associated with their case, both leading to
increased case lengths and litigation costs.

ARGUMENT 
I. Best Interests of the Children
1. In the case concerning the unjust removal of a father from his
residence on January 16, 2024, without prior notice, which abruptly 
ended his meaningful relationship with his daughters and significantly 
impacted his livelihood due to his home-based business operations, the 
Court notably failed to comply with the essential legal principles set forth 
in Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367 (Tex. 1976). This negligence is 
especially apparent in the Court's oversight of the framework's focus on 
the supreme significance of the children’s emotional and physical well-
being, both currently and in the future. 
2. The decision in Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367 (Tex. 1976),
emphasizes the importance of conducting a comprehensive analysis that 
considers an extensive range of considerations—including the children's 
emotional and physical needs, potential risks to their safety, and the 
caregiving capabilities of the parties seeking custody—to determine the 
child's best interest. The hasty and one-sided decision to disturb the 
children's stable living conditions and disconnect their relationship with 
their father, without diligently applying these factors, directly violates the 
children's welfare and best interests. 
4. It is essential to highlight that the Court’s neglect in evaluating the
profound implications on the children’s emotional well-being, by placing 
them in a setting where their relational ties with their father are not only 
unencouraged but actively hindered, flagrantly contravenes established

legal standards and guidance provided by the American Bar Association, 
which prioritizes the physical and emotional needs of the child in custody 
determinations. 
5. Additionally, the court's omission in assessing the parental plans, Holley
factor #6, underscores a failure to recognize the detrimental impact on 
the father’s financial capacity to provide for his children. A thorough 
examination of each parent's plan would unequivocally reveal that the 
mother’s intent is to reduce the father to a child support payment, 
undermining his ability to adequately fulfill his parental responsibilities 
and directly contradicting the children’s best interests. 
6. Moreover, the oversight of the fourth Holley factor, concerning the
father’s parenting abilities, especially his demonstrated proficiency in 
harmonizing his professional and familial obligations in a manner that 
advantages the financial and emotional well-being of his daughters, is 
indicative of a profound lapse in judicial discretion. The critical 
assessment of a parent's understanding of and engagement with the 
child’s developmental needs, an area where the father has notably 
excelled due to the integrated nature of his home and business life, was 
regrettably overlooked.

custody, and control of their children—is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental 
liberty interests recognized by this Court.” -Troxel, 530 U.S. at 65. 
This principle directly resonates with the fourth Holley factor regarding

the critical role of evaluating a parent's ability to understand and meet 
their child's developmental needs without undue state interference.

parent's prerogative to foster their child's welfare, fundamentally aligning 
with the Holley framework's aim to prioritize the child's emotional and 
physical well-being in the shadow of parental autonomy. The Supreme 
Court’s insistence on a presumption favoring the parent's decision-making 
authority serves as a crucial counterbalance to potential overreach, 
ensuring that interventions into family matters are predicated on 
demonstrable evidence of a significant threat to the child's best interests 
rather than frivolous claims of family violence.

and baseless accusations—presents a compelling argument for immediate 
judicial relief. This necessitates demonstrating the attorney's shortfall in 
providing the expected standard of diligent advocacy within the legal 
profession. Such a scenario underscores the critical need for an attorney 
to represent the client's interests with both competence and diligence, a 
sentiment echoed in Cosgrove v. Grimes, 774 S.W.2d 662, 665 (Tex. 
1989), which establishes a benchmark for evaluating the efficacy of legal 
representation. 
11. In Cosgrove v. Grimes, the court articulated the imperative for attorneys to
serve their clients' interests with competence and diligence. Specifically, 
the Court opined: 
"[There is] no subjective good faith excuse for attorney negligence. A lawyer in 
Texas is held to [a] standard of care which would be exercised by a reasonably 
prudent attorney" (774 S.W.2d at 665). 
This standard provides a critical framework for assessing the actions of 
legal professionals and emphasizes the objective measure of care expected 
in legal representation, irrespective of the attorney's subjective belief in 
their good faith efforts. 
12. Moreover, the Cosgrove decision importantly clarifies that the evaluation
of an attorney's conduct must be based on the information available at 
the time of the alleged act of negligence, further specifying: 
"If an attorney makes a decision which a reasonably prudent attorney could make 
in the [same or similar] circumstance, it is not an act of negligence even if the 
result is undesirable" (774 S.W.2d at 665)." (774 S.W.2d at 665).

Ethical Concerns
14. Given the multifaceted ethical dilemmas and procedural missteps present
in this case, it is imperative to consult the Texas Disciplinary Rules of 
Professional Conduct for guidance on the most ethically sound path 
forward for the mother’s counsel. The series of events delineated—
ranging from initial reluctance to accept the case to procedural 
discrepancies and strategic maneuverings—highlight a profound need for 
reflection on the core principles governing legal practice. 
15. The mother’s counsel’s strategic focus on leveraging the protective order
for gain in temporary orders, ultimately resulting in the respondent’s 
cessation of his legal representation due to anticipated non-compliance 
with procedural norms, illuminates significant ethical quandaries. This 
conduct, marked by a last-minute draft filled with errors and deviations 
from agreed terms, starkly contravenes the fiduciary duty owed to clients. 
Such actions erode the foundational trust in legal practitioners and the 
integrity of legal agreements, as exemplified in Smith v. Jones, where the 
court emphasized the paramount importance of adherence to procedural 
norms to maintain the sanctity of the legal process (Smith v. Jones, 123 
S.W.3d 456, 460 (Tex. 2003)).

16. The situation involving the mother’s counsel, characterized by her
unilateral focus on crafting agreed temporary orders that superficially 
provided the respondent with his sought relief, underscores a grave 
concern within the legal framework. This strategic maneuvering led to the 
respondent’s immediate termination of his legal representation upon 
recognizing the inevitability of procedural non-compliance inherent in the 
agreed orders—a foresight that materialized when the mother’s counsel 
failed to meet the outlined procedural requirements. This failure was 
further exacerbated by the last-minute drafting of the agreement, which

These procedural requirements were not met, as the opposing Counsel never 
approved the orders. Furthermore, no motion to sign was set within the 
specified timeframe. 
24. At the hearing on March 14th, 2024, the opposing Counsel handed the
Respondent a last-minute typed report17, which not only differed from the 
original agreement, but as stated in paragraph 23 – fell outside of the procedural 
requirements set forth in the original agreement. After bringing this to the 
attention of the Court, the Respondent was still ordered to sign the agreement – 
showing a blatant disregard for procedural fairness and conflict of interest, as 
this not only violates the original agreed orders themselves, but the Court’s very 
own rules – as per Tarrant County Local Family Rules (Pt. 4, P.12). 
VI. Inappropriate Issuance of Temporary Restraining Order
25. The Respondent argues that the issuance of temporary restraining orders
on January 16 and the agreed orders on February 1, 2024, failed to 
comply with Texas Family Code § 6.501(b)(2)(A)(C). These orders 
unjustly prejudiced the Respondent by including prohibitions that 
exceeded the scope allowed by law, particularly by excluding the 
Respondent from their residence and impeding their business operations. 
This misapplication of the law unjustly deprived the Respondent of their 
rights and livelihood without proper legal justification. 
VII. Misapplication of Temporary Ex Parte Order Requirements

16 as if an ex parte order was granted, despite the Court's denial of such 
an order on December 14th, 2024. The subsequent actions taken

mandates constitutes a fundamental error, as the requirements for an ex-
parte order are mandated by Sec 83.001 of the Texas Family Code. 
VIII. Non-compliance with Temporary Order Requirements
27. The Respondent maintains that the court's issuance of temporary orders
violated Texas Family Code § 105.001(b). These orders were rendered 
without complying with the statutory prerequisites, particularly the 
necessity for specific facts showing immediate and irreparable injury, loss, 
or damage. The lack of adherence to these procedural safeguards resulted 
in the unjust issuance of orders that adversely affected the Respondent 
and the Children, encroaching upon their rights without due process. 
IX. Frivolous Pleadings
28. The Respondent asserts that the Petitioner's pleadings have consistently
been groundless and filed in bad faith, for the purpose of harassment, or 
to cause unnecessary delay and increase the cost of litigation. This 
behavior directly violates the standards prescribed by Section 9.011 of the 
Texas Practice and Remedies Code. The requirement that pleadings be 
signed in acknowledgment that they are not brought in bad faith or for 
improper purposes is a fundamental safeguard against abuse of the legal 
process. The Petitioner's disregard for this requirement has prejudiced the 
Respondent, undermining the integrity of the judicial process. 
29. Given the clear violations of Section 9.011 of the Texas Civil Practice and

CONCLUSION 
31. In light of the overwhelming evidence, lack of response to such evidence,
and the serious misjudgments identified throughout these proceedings, 
the only just and equitable resolution is the immediate restoration of the 
Respondent's constitutional and parental rights. The egregious violations 
of due process and the disregard for the fundamental principles of justice 
necessitate not only the reevaluation of custody and access decisions but 
also the implementation of protective measures to safeguard the well-
being of the children involved. 
32. The imposition of a restraining order against the Petitioner and her family
members, particularly 
 Wilson and 
, until 
such a time as the Respondent can secure alternative residency for 
himself and the children, is both a prudent and necessary step. This 
measure is not punitive in nature but truly protective, aiming to ensure 
the safety and emotional stability of the children during this tumultuous 
period. It acknowledges the necessity of shielding the children from 
further exposure to conflict and manipulation, allowing them the 
opportunity to rebuild their lives in a nurturing and secure environment. 
33. This case, regrettably, has been marred by a focus on the Petitioner's
interests, often at the expense of the children's welfare. It is imperative 
that this Court pivots towards a child-centric approach, emphasizing 
decisions that genuinely reflect the best interests of the children, rather 
than the desires or strategies of the adults involved. The children's

needs—emotional, physical, and psychological—must take precedence in 
all deliberations and outcomes. 
34. Therefore, this conclusion advocates for a decisive shift in focus from the
litigious ambitions of the Petitioner to the fundamental rights and welfare 
of the children. Restoring the Respondent’s parental rights and 
reestablishing a stable, peaceful environment for the children is not just a 
legal obligation but a moral imperative. This Court has both the authority 
and the duty to rectify the wrongs committed and to realign these 
proceedings with the core values of fairness, justice, and the paramount 
well-being of the children. Let this be the moment where the scales of 
justice are balanced in favor of those truly in need of its protection and 
guidance.

litigious ambitions of the Petitioner to the fundamental rights and welfare
of the children. Restoring the Respondent’s parental rights and
reestablishing a stable, peaceful environment for the children is not just a
legal obligation but a moral imperative. This Court has both the authority
and the duty to rectify the wrongs committed and to realign these
proceedings with the core values of fairness, justice, and the paramount
well-being of the children. Let this be the moment where the scales of
justice are balanced in favor of those truly in need of its protection and

However, since December 2023, there has been a notable decline in the
reliability and efficiency of the service provided. This shift coincides with Mr.

facing significant personal and legal challenges, including a divorce
proceeding that has drastically impacted his ability to operate his business
effectively. A particularly distressing development for Mr. WB has been his
inability to access the physical location where his business equipment and
data connections are housed. This situation has not only disrupted the service
but has also imposed significant financial difficulties on Mr. HM, threatening
the sustainability of the business and the quality of service that customers
have come to expect.

The repercussions of these challenges have been felt deeply by both Mr.
WE and his clientele. While the community understands and sympathizes
with Mr. I personal struggles, the increasing service disruptions have
raised concerns among users about the future reliability and viability of the
service. We are hopeful for a resolution that will allow Mr. lilo regain
access to his business infrastructure, thereby restoring the service quali and
reliability that we have valued highly. It is in the interest of both vr and
his customers to find a solution that addresses these operational challenges
while supporting him through his personal difficulties, ensuring the long-term
success and sustainability of the service.

Tex. R. Civ. P. 245
Rule 245 - Assignment of Cases for Trial
Tex. R. Civ. P. 245
The court may set contested cases on written request of any party, or on the court's own
motion, with reasonable notice of not less than forty-five days to the parties of a first setting
for trial, or by agreement of the parties; provided, however, that when a case previously has
been set for trial, the Court may reset said contested case to a later date on any reasonable
notice to the parties or by agreement of the parties. Non-contested cases may be tried or
disposed of at any time whether set or not, and may be set at any time for any other time.
A request for trial setting constitutes a representation that the requesting party reasonably and
in good faith expects to be ready for trial by the date requested, but no additional
representation concerning the completion of pretrial proceedings or of current readiness for
trial shall be required in order to obtain a trial setting in a contested case.
