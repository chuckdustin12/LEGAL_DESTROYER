TO THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS:  
Relator Charles Dustin Myers, proceeding pro se, respectfully files this 
Motion for Rehearing under Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 52.9. Relator asks 
the Court to reconsider its April 11, 2025, per curiam memorandum opinion 
denying, without explanation, Relator’s petition for writ of mandamus and 
emergency relief. As shown below, the Court’s summary denial failed to address 
uncontested facts and controlling law demonstrating that the trial court’s orders at 
issue are facially void and have caused—and continue to cause—ongoing harm to 
Relator’s fundamental rights and his children’s status quo. Because no party has 
disputed Relator’s evidence or arguments, the Court’s refusal to act creates legal 
and logical inconsistencies that demand correction. Without any substantive 
explanation, the parties remain in the exact same spot they have been in for a year 
with no adequate remedy by an appeal.  
Relief Requested 
 
Relator requests that this court: 
1. Reconsider and grant Relator’s emergency motion for declaratory 
relief and declare the orders issued on March 14, 2024, void ab initio 
for lacking the consent of all parties and for not being adopted by the 
referring judge.

TO THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS:

Relator Charles Dustin Myers, proceeding pro se, respectfully files this
Motion for Rehearing under Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 52.9. Relator asks
the Court to reconsider its April 11, 2025, per curiam memorandum opinion
denying, without explanation, Relator’s petition for writ of mandamus and
emergency relief. As shown below, the Court’s summary denial failed to address
uncontested facts and controlling law demonstrating that the trial court’s orders at
issue are facially void and have caused—and continue to cause—ongoing harm to
Relator’s fundamental rights and his children’s status quo. Because no party has
disputed Relator’s evidence or arguments, the Court’s refusal to act creates legal
and logical inconsistencies that demand correction. Without any substantive
explanation, the parties remain in the exact same spot they have been in for a year

with no adequate remedy by an appeal.

Relief Requested

Relator requests that this court:

1. Reconsider and grant Relator’s emergency motion for declaratory
relief and declare the orders issued on March 14, 2024, void ab initio
for lacking the consent of all parties and for not being adopted by the

referring judge.

2. Compel the Respondent by issuing the writ of mandamus to hold a 
hearing on the Relator’s EMERGENCY TRO at the earliest possible 
date to protect the Relator’s fundamental rights afforded to him by the 
United States Constitution. 
Grounds for Rehearing 
 
Rehearing is warranted because the Court’s denial of mandamus relief 
overlooked or misapprehended critical facts and controlling law, resulting in a 
decision inconsistent with its own prior released opinions. Further, immediately 
after the Mandamus was filed on April 10, 2025, the 233rd district court sua sponte 
granted a consolidation motion without notice or hearing, and without jurisdiction. 
1. A clear abuse of discretion occurred. 
 
  Generally, mandamus issues correct a clear abuse of discretion, or the 
violation of a duty imposed by law when there is no other adequate remedy at law. 
In re Bass, 113 S.W.3d 735, 738 (Tex. 2003) (orig. proceeding); Walker v. Packer, 
827 S.W.2d 833, 839 (Tex. 1992). By refusing to hear an emergency TRO that had 
been set for a hearing agreed upon by the parties, the Respondent clearly abused 
her discretion in denying an emergency TRO that was before the court on March 
28, 2025. 
 
These facts are clearly established in the mandamus record.

Rehearing is warranted because the Court’s denial of mandamus relief
overlooked or misapprehended critical facts and controlling law, resulting in a

after the Mandamus was filed on April 10, 2025, the 233" district court sua sponte

1. A clear abuse of discretion occurred.

Generally, mandamus issues correct a clear abuse of discretion, or the
violation of a duty imposed by law when there is no other adequate remedy at law.
In re Bass, 113 S.W.3d 735, 738 (Tex. 2003) (orig. proceeding); Walker v. Packer,

These facts are clearly established in the mandamus record.

2. Relator has no adequate remedy by an appeal 
Because an order was not produced from the Respondent’s refusal to hear 
the emergency motion, the Relator has been left with nothing to challenge and 
therefore has no adequate remedy by an appeal. 
3. The orders referenced in the emergency motion are void 
 
The orders issued on March 14, 2024, are facially void. They expressly state 
that “As evidenced by the signatures below, the parties consent to the terms of the 
order”. App 2.1 On the final page of the document, only the signatures of the Real 
Party in Interest and her counsel are present. Therefore, because the trial court 
judge signed the orders knowing the consent of all parties was not present, the 
orders are void from the very beginning, or void ab initio. Because they are void, 
not voidable, they can be collaterally attacked at any time. In re E.R., 385 S.W.3d 
552, –––– (Tex.2012). 
 
By refusing to act, the Relator and the children will continue to suffer 
ongoing harm while the Real Party in Interest enjoys her silence alongside her 
legal representative to these challenges. 
 
By declaring the orders void, the rights of all parties are preserved pending a 
legitimate hearing.

CONCLUSION 
This Court’s denial—issued without explanation and in the face of 
unopposed, uncontested evidence—undermines both judicial integrity and the rule 
of law. The trial court has enforced facially void orders, refused to hear a properly 
filed emergency motion, and acted without jurisdiction. Meanwhile, no party has 
challenged the factual or legal grounds asserted in Relator’s petition, or pleadings 
below. The Court’s silence, like that of the lower court, only prolongs the ongoing 
injury to the Relator and his children. 
This case does not present a close call. It presents a failure to apply the law. 
The trial court’s actions defy Texas precedent and constitutional due process. The 
lack of any meaningful remedy by appeal, coupled with the continuing harm and 
the trial court’s blatant disregard for consent and jurisdiction, demands immediate 
appellate intervention. Relator respectfully requests that this Court reverse its 
denial, grant rehearing, and issue relief—before further injustice is compounded by 
delay. 
In In re Acceptance Ins. Co., this very Court granted mandamus where a trial 
court acted sua sponte, without notice, and over objections, in clear violation of 
due process. Yet here, despite a nearly identical procedural abuse—a consolidation

order issued without notice, hearing, jurisdiction, or objection considered—Relator 
is met not with relief, but with silence. 
To deny relief now is to contradict this Court’s own precedent. If the law 
applied then, it must apply now. Otherwise, the rules are not rules—they are 
merely suggestions applied at convenience, not principle.
