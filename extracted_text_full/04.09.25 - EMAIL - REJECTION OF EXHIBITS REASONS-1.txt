Hello,
I've been submitting exhibits to multiple courts now, and have never been rejected and told to specifically remove exhibits
until now.
This is regarding envelope number 99405680.
I'm reaching out as directed by the refusal request:
Please resubmit without the attached exhibits.
For more information about the return of this envelope please contact the court coordinator Angie Wierzbicki by phone at
(817)884-2686 or by email at ADWierzbicki@tarrantcountytx.gov.
To maintain the original file date, you must copy the original filing envelope, make the corrections, and resubmit the filing
with the original file date within 72 hours. Thank you, Catherine Saenz 817-884-1581
tcdc233@tarrantcountytx.gov
Could you provide the justification for this?
Respectfully,
Charles D. Myers

Good afternoon,
Each court/Judge is different in what they will or will not accept into a case.
For our court you can reach out to our coordinator Angie on how to submit those exhibits to the court, but
we are unable to accept any exhibits into the case.
I have added Angie onto this email for your convenience.
Thank you,
