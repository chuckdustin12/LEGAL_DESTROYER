Re: 
CJC No. 25-0586 
Dear Mr. Myers: 
 
We appreciate the concerns raised in your complaint. However, after conducting a thorough 
investigation into the allegations that you raised against the judge, the Commission determined, in its 
discretion: 
☒ there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of judicial misconduct.  
☐ the decisions of the judge in your case were discretionary and not subject to review by  
this agency. 
☐ the allegations, even if true, did not constitute a violation of the Texas Code of Judicial  
Conduct or Tex. Const. Article 5, Section 1-a, (the constitutional provisions under 
which a judge can be disciplined by the Commission.) 
 
Although we are prohibited by law from disclosing the specifics of our investigation, please be 
aware that our investigation can include, but is not limited to, consideration of the supporting information 
submitted by a complainant, interviewing other individuals with knowledge of the matters addressed in the 
information you provided, and reviewing court records and pleadings. In conformity with the specific 
constitutional provisions, statutes and canons, which limit the actions that may be considered judicial 
misconduct, the Commission voted to dismiss your complaint.  
However, if you have additional evidence (e.g., witness statements, affidavits, hearing transcripts, 
etc.) that you believe may not have been reviewed or considered by the Commission, you may request, one 
time only, a reconsideration by the Commission.  Please provide your written Request for Reconsideration, 
along with photocopies of any documents you wish the Commission to review, no later than thirty (30) 
days from the date of this letter.  Be sure to reference the above-listed file numbers in your requests. 
While not all complaints result in a finding of misconduct, we appreciate your concerns and your 
interest in assisting us in maintaining the high ethical standards of the Texas judiciary.  Thank you for 
bringing these issues to our attention.

Re: CJC No. 25-0586
Dear Mr. Myers:

We appreciate the concerns raised in your complaint. However, after conducting a thorough
investigation into the allegations that you raised against the judge, the Commission determined, in its
discretion:

XX] there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of judicial misconduct.

L] the decisions of the judge in your case were discretionary and not subject to review by

this agency.

L] the allegations, even if true, did not constitute a violation of the Texas Code of Judicial
Conduct or Tex. Const. Article 5, Section 1-a, (the constitutional provisions under
which a judge can be disciplined by the Commission.)

Although we are prohibited by law from disclosing the specifics of our investigation, please be
aware that our investigation can include, but is not limited to, consideration of the supporting information
submitted by a complainant, interviewing other individuals with knowledge of the matters addressed in the
information you provided, and reviewing court records and pleadings. In conformity with the specific
constitutional provisions, statutes and canons, which limit the actions that may be considered judicial
misconduct, the Commission voted to dismiss your complaint.

However, if you have additional evidence (e.g., witness statements, affidavits, hearing transcripts,
etc.) that you believe may not have been reviewed or considered by the Commission, you may request, one
time only, a reconsideration by the Commission. Please provide your written Request for Reconsideration,
along with photocopies of any documents you wish the Commission to review, no later than thirty (30)
days from the date of this letter. Be sure to reference the above-listed file numbers in your requests.

While not all complaints result in a finding of misconduct, we appreciate your concerns and your
interest in assisting us in maintaining the high ethical standards of the Texas judiciary. Thank you for
bringing these issues to our attention.
