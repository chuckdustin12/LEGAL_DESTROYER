5. COOPER L. CARTER’s authority to represent MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS has been in

25. The Associate Judge disagreed and refused to hear the emergency TRO. 
26. At the close of business on March 28, 2025, nothing was ever filed with the 322nd

28. Petitioner’s detriment to his position is the fact that he is self-represented. 
29. Respondent’s detriment to her position is the lack of prosecution or defense. 
II. ARGUMENT 
30. When it comes to remand, the obligation falls on the plaintiff to file with the state 
court a certified copy of the order of remand. TEX. R. CIV. P. 237a; see also Kashan v. McLane 
Co., NO. 03-11-00125-CV, 7 (Tex. App. Jun. 7, 2012) (holding that rule 237a’s notice 
requirements cannot be satisfied by the district court, but must come from the plaintiff.)  
 
31. This prevents any trial on the merits, and prevents any relief to the Petitioner and his 
children.  
 
32. All other facts supported by evidence have already been provided to COOPER L. 
CARTER yet continues to not engage and instead call in favors from the bench.  
 
III. CONCLUSION 
Petitioner traveled to this court with a prepared emergency supported by exhibits only to 
be turned away at the eleventh hour due to his self-represented status and in the face of no real 
opposition. The children were denied due process outright, and now have been left without a 
remedy. The proper course of action should have been to hear the TRO and put in place 
protections for the minor children pending any promises of consolidation.

I. ARGUMENT

30. When it comes to remand, the obligation falls on the plaintiff to file with the state
court a certified copy of the order of remand. TEX. R. CIV. P. 237a; see also Kashan v. McLane
Co., NO. 03-11-00125-CV, 7 (Tex. App. Jun. 7, 2012) (holding that rule 237a’s notice
requirements cannot be satisfied by the district court, but must come from the plaintiff. )

31. This prevents any trial on the merits, and prevents any relief to the Petitioner and his
children.

32. All other facts supported by evidence have already been provided to COOPER L.

CARTER yet continues to not engage and instead call in favors from the bench.

I. CONCLUSION
Petitioner traveled to this court with a prepared emergency supported by exhibits only to
be turned away at the eleventh hour due to his self-represented status and in the face of no real
opposition. The children were denied due process outright, and now have been left without a
remedy. The proper course of action should have been to hear the TRO and put in place

The above statement of facts, unless promptly rebutted by COOPER L. CARTER, warrant 
immediate relief as duly requested in the emergency TRO through a declaratory judgement, and this court 
should proceed with the hearing date originally set for April 10th, 2025, and the emergency TRO should be 
GRANTED without further delay. 
COOPER L. CARTER disrupted much needed relief for the minor children in this case with false 
promises delivered to the tribunal that directly undermined the Petitioner’s due process rights. COOPER L. 
CARTER is fully aware that she cannot file anything in 322nd District Court because in doing so she would 
be acting ultra vires.   
Petitioner reasserts his position that COOPER L. CARTER is acting without authority, has no 
ability to comply with 237a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and cannot explain how she is able to 
abandon a case for nearly a full calendar year, yet can suddenly show up to defend her alleged client before 
this court for the sole purpose to prevent Petitioner’s emergency TRO from being heard, which was 
permitted despite being told he could present the motion. In what sense is this appropriate when children 
are involved? Does the attorney’s license give her a free pass to thwart the rules and litigate in bad faith? 
It may be a needle in the haystack, but this case defies the initial presumption that pro-se litigants 
are not as equipped or as capable as licensed attorneys, and it is no fault of COOPER L. CARTER. The 
Petitioner reminds the court that the true culprit responsible for this circumstance remains the puppet master 
hiding in the background – the Respondent – and yet Petitioner wishes no harm to her because this litigation 
is about the children. The children need their mother, but they also need their father.  
Perhaps the zealous passion has been misunderstood for contempt by the tribunal, but Petitioner’s 
motive runs parallel to that set forth in the Texas Family Code. However, despite the procedural quagmire, 
the anomalies, the pro-se status, the solution remains simple:  
Grant the relief. Nobody has argued against it, Texas law demands it, and the best interests of the 
Children depend on it. There remains no logical or legal basis to give COOPER L. CARTER any further 
deference in the face of Petitioner’s self-represented status. Petitioner welcomes any response from

COOPER L. CARTER to the contrary. If such response were to be filed, it would be the first in over fourteen 
months of litigation. 
If approached from a logical standpoint, the situation can be interpreted as such: 
i. 
COOPER L. CARTER is shackled by Rule 12 and Rule 237a of the 
Texas Rules of Civil Procedure from reaching final trial. 
ii. 
The 322nd District Court is shackled from proceeding due to Cooper 
L. Carter’s failure to prosecute. 
iii. 
The Petitioner is shackled from his home, his children’s daily lives, 
and his place of business under facially void orders that claim 
consent. 
iv. 
Most critically, the children are shackled in a situation that is not in 
their best interests and continue to suffer irreparable harm without 
any opportunity for relief and without any lawful basis. 
Indeed, that leaves just one party un-chained from this situation:  
the Respondent. Petitioner rests his case. 
IV. PRAYER 
WHEREFORE promises considered, the Petitioner, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, 
requests the following expedited relief: 
1. Take judicial knowledge that COOPER L. CARTER disrupted an emergency in 
bad faith and failed to fulfill her promise. 
2. Grant the emergency TRO without delay and keep the original hearing date set 
for April 10th as agreed by the parties on March 28th, 2025.  
3. Give no further deference to attorney COOPER L. CARTER, who has not 
prosecuted nor defended her position, and require a written response.

II. LEGAL VIOLATIONS BY FAILURE TO RULE ON MOTIONS 
1. Failure to Rule on Unopposed Motions Violates Texas Law 
A. Texas courts have a duty to rule on properly filed motions within a reasonable 
time (In re Blakeney, 254 S.W.3d 659 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2008)). 
B. Courts cannot ignore motions indefinitely, especially when they remain 
unopposed (In re Bonds, 57 S.W.3d 456 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2001)). 
2. Due Process Violations (14th Amendment, U.S. Constitution; Article I, § 19, Texas 
Constitution) 
A. The Court’s refusal to issue rulings or set hearings deprives Respondent of due 
process rights. 
B. The failure to act on Rule 12 Motion to Show Authority means opposing 
counsel may be practicing unlawfully, rendering all their filings void.

A. Texas courts have a duty to rule on properly filed motions within a reasonable

B. Courts cannot ignore motions indefinitely, especially when they remain

A. The Court’s inaction on emergency motions for custody and residence is a 
direct failure of its duty to prioritize the best interest of children (Tex. Fam. 
Code § 153.002). 
B. The Court has no discretion to ignore properly filed summary judgment 
motions, especially when unopposed (Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c)). There is no 
genuine issue of material fact, and the Respondent is entitled to relief as a matter 
of law. 
III. CONTINUED SILENCE FROM OPPOSING PARTY DESPITE GLARING MISUSE 
OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM 
1. The opposing party in this case has refused to prosecute for over four months. 
2. The Petitioner in this case has unquestionably deceived this court into relying on 
false claims of indigency and false claims for protection. 
3. The Respondent has filed over 4,700 pages of documents that have been ignored 
outright by the court, the opposing party, and court staff. 
4. The Petitioner continues to neglect the children medically, continues to escape 
accountability for her egregious actions, and has offered no rebuttal or defense 
against any of the claims made against her. 
5. The Respondent continues to suffer monetary damages each day this situation 
persists without resolution. 
6. The court has been given ample information to justify an immediate ruling as 
required by law, yet the Respondent continues to be stonewalled.

7. The current temporary orders state all parties agree to the terms of the order, 
reference a hearing not found on the docket sheet, yet continue to remain in effect 
despite several pleas for correction being submitted and reviewed by court staff. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
 
Respondent reasserts that Texas Law prevents such scenarios such as what is occurring in 
this case from happening, yet it continues unaddressed. Respondent only asks of this court, the 
reviewing staff, and any reviewing judicial officer that Texas laws be followed, and that this 
situation be immediately corrected. The systemic abuse faced by the Respondent has damaged 
the children’s well-being and permitted the Petitioner to continue to get away with her immoral 
actions that have placed fraud upon this court without consequence. 
 
Respondent urges this court to make swift, corrective decisions that are warranted by 
setting immediately ruling upon the pending motions before it and granting the long overdue 
relief that is both necessary and justified.

9. Most disturbing is that this settlement agreement permitted the Petitioner
to remove her children from their own home for an entire month – a clear 
disregard for their well being – and the court signed off on this. 
10. Further, this agreement was challenged via a motion to reconsider which
was denied on March 14th, 2024, but Judge Kaitcer. 
11. To date, no findings of fact or conclusions of law have been issued
regarding this ruling despite notifying the court that they are past-due. 
12. At the hearing on March 14th, 2024, the docket reflects only the
Respondent appearing before the court. 
13. Just prior to the hearing, Respondent was served the current orders by
COOPER L. CARTER, not DAN BACALIS, just minutes before the hearing was 
to commence that was filed to challenge them. 
14. Despite the agreement stating that a typed written order shall be
prepared by Dan Bacalis, despite the 20 day time limit, and despite the five day 
review period that all parties and Judge Kaitcer agreed to -  the orders were 
permitted to be prepared at the last minute by COOPER L. CARTER, well after the 
20-day deadline, and despite the Respondent’s consent not being present, he was
ordered to sign the agreement in violation of Texas Law by 1:30 P.M. that same 
day.

a pre-determined outcome. 
III. CONCLUSION
16. There is no doubt that this matter is filled with deception and unethical
practices. The Petitioner, in an effort to conceal her marital affair, had no problem 
taking her own children out of their home, falsifying her financial status after 
converting funds from the marital estate with the assistance of a third party,

claiming financial responsibility over property paid for by the Respondent, 
fabricating the existence of protective orders, instigating frivolous eviction suits, 
and falsifying the need for protection. 
17. On December 22, 2023, Petitioner filed for a protective order despite
already claiming to have one in effect in her original petition for divorce, yet text 
evidence clearly shows the Petitioner at home with Respondent on this same day – 
showing no need of protection as they continued to cohabit up until January 16th, 
2024. 
18. There exists no legal basis for the court’s continued stonewalling.
19. Therefore, continued disregard for the well-being of the Children and
Respondent’s rights must cease. 
20. Issue relief by granting summary judgment in Respondent's favor
without delay.

ANSWER AND MOTION TO
CONSOLIDATE

MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS,

Respondent.

2025-03-30

TO THE HONORABLE 233"! DISTRICT COURT:

Petitioner, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, respectfully submits this motion to strike
Respondent’s answer and motion to consolidate, and in support thereof, would show the court the

following:

I. STATEMENT OF FACTS

1. On March 20, 2025, Respondent, MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS, filed an answer

entering a general denial for the claims made against her and a motion to consolidate.

2. The response alleges that it was necessary for the Respondent to acquire the services of

Cooper L. Carter.

3. The Respondent’s answer and motion to consolidate were filed on Cooper Carter’s 
behalf by Roderick D. Marx, a party not named in either this suit or the related divorce suit (322-
744263-23). 
 
4. Roderick D. Marx has filed all pleadings on Cooper Carter’s behalf because Cooper 
Carter’s electronic filing manager credentials are registered under the law farm Cantey and 
Hangar, LLP. See Exhibit 1. 
 
5. Respondent’s answer and motion to consolidate are an attempt to subvert the relief the 
children desperately need, and failed to argue as to how these pleadings are in the best interests 
of the children. 
A. Sudden Activity after Months of Delay 
6. Respondent’s Answer asserts the existence of a prior divorce case (Cause No. 322-
744263-23) involving the parties as a basis to delay or abate this Suit Affecting Parent-Child 
Relationship (SAPCR). However, that divorce case has been stalled for months with no 
meaningful action by Respondent or her alleged counsel. Respondent’s counsel has failed to 
diligently prosecute the divorce matter, and a dormant case cannot justify stalling this separate 
SAPCR proceeding. In short, the children’s issues should not be put on hold due to an unrelated 
divorce case that remains inactive. 
B. SAPCR Suit Focus (Lack of Child-Related Response) 
7. This SAPCR is focused on the welfare and best interests of the children, yet the 
Respondent’s Original Answer is devoid of any substantive response regarding the children. 
Respondent merely states that the information required under Texas Family Code §§154.181(b) 
and 154.1815 “will be provided at a later date”and then enters a general denial. No specific

Relationship (SAPCR). However, that divorce case has been stalled for months with no

7. This SAPCR is focused on the welfare and best interests of the children, yet the
Respondent’s Original Answer is devoid of any substantive response regarding the children.
Respondent merely states that the information required under Texas Family Code §§154.181(b)
and 154.1815 “will be provided at a later date’’and then enters a general denial. No specific

conservatorship, support, or visitation issues are addressed at all. By failing to engage with the 
core child-related allegations in the Petition, Respondent’s Answer is irrelevant to the central 
issues of this proceeding and provides the Court with nothing of substance on the SAPCR 
matters. 
8. Respondent’s Answer claims that it was “necessary for Respondent to secure the 
services of COOPER L. CARTER, a licensed attorney, to prepare and defend this suit”. Yet the 
pleading was filed under the letterhead of Marx, Altman & Johnson (Attorney Roderick D. 
Marx’s firm) and is electronically signed by Cooper L. Carter as “Attorney for Respondent”. 
This inconsistency creates confusion as to who represents Respondent in this case. Texas practice 
expects clarity in counsel of record (see Tex. R. Civ. P. 8 requiring designation of lead counsel), 
but here Respondent’s Answer sends mixed signals by invoking Mr. Carter’s name and services 
while being filed through Mr. Marx’s firm. Such a contradiction in representation is procedurally 
improper and fails to clearly identify the attorney in charge of Respondent’s case. 
9. In addition to the above, there are irregularities in the manner Respondent’s Answer 
was filed. Upon information and belief, the Answer was submitted via an Electronic Filing 
Manager (EFM) account registered to Cooper L. Carter under the law firm Cantey & Hanger, 
which is not the firm appearing on the pleading. In other words, the electronic filing credentials 
used do not match the law firm or attorney officially listed on the document. This raises serious 
concerns about the validity of the filing and compliance with Texas e-filing rules (see Tex. R. 
Civ. P. 21(f)). Filings must be made by the attorney of record under their proper account for 
transparency and proper notice. Using an EFM account associated with a different firm (Cantey 
& Hanger) for a pleading filed under Marx, Altman & Johnson’s banner is a procedural anomaly 
that calls into question whether Respondent’s Answer was filed in accordance with the required

procedures.  Further, the email address COOPERCARTER@MAJADMIN.COM associated with 
the pleadings filed in this court is NOT registered under the EFM in which they were filed. 
10. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 21(f) requires that electronic ﬁlings be made through 
an authorized EFM account corresponding to the attorney of record. The use of an account 
registered under one ﬁrm (Cantey & Hanger) to ﬁle pleadings under a different ﬁrm’s name (Marx, 
Altman & Johnson) constitutes a procedural violation, undermining the validity of the ﬁling and 
raising concerns about whether the attorney of record actually authorized or executed the ﬁling. 
11. This discrepancy calls into question the legitimacy of Respondent’s Answer and 
warrants immediate review by the Court. Given the attorney filing the document did not use 
their own credentials under which the pleading was submitted, yet claimed her individual 
services were necessary, renders the filing as procedurally defective and should be struck 
from the record sua sponte. 
PRAYER FOR RELIEF 
12. Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court strike Respondent’s Original Answer 
and motion to consolidate in its entirety sua sponte. Petitioner further requests that Respondent 
be required to refile any answer or responsive pleading in compliance with all applicable 
procedural rules – including proper attorney-of-record designation and use of correct electronic 
filing credentials – and to ensure that any such pleading addresses the substantive SAPCR issues 
regarding the children. Petitioner also prays for such other and further relief, at law or in equity, 
to which he may be justly entitled.

TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THE 233" DISTRICT COURT:

1. For the preceding twelve months and fourteen days, Petitioner has been unlawfully
Barred from entering his residence and has been cut out of his children’s lives. On March 6",
2024, while walking M.E.M and C.R.M. to school, Respondent unlawfully locked the Petitioner
out of the matrimonial home and called the Watauga police department who came to assist in the
dispute. When on scene at ee, Respondent produced an
agreed associate judge’s report where consent had been withdrawn and used it as a means to bar
the Petitioner’s entry to the home. With an emergency hearing date set for March 14", 2024, the
Petitioner took the advice of the officers and stayed with his father temporarily in Flower
Mound, Texas to avoid unnecessary conflict.

2. On March 14", 2024, the Petitioner appeared in person and was served a reduced copy

of the orders he was in court to challenge and from which he withdrew his consent from. Despite

this, the orders were rendered anyway, effectively barring the Petitioner from his own home and 
Children’s lives despite his consent not being present at the time of rendition.  
 
3. The orders in question, attached hereto as EXHIBIT 1, are facially void and lack legal 
effect. Despite this, they continue to cause ongoing and irreparable harm, as further detailed 
below. Accordingly, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court issue a declaratory judgment 
formally recognizing the invalidity of these orders which will simultaneously provide long-
overdue relief to the children in this matter. In support of this request, the Petitioner shows as 
follows: 
I. STATEMENT OF FACTS 
 
4. On page 1 of the orders, they read as follows: “The parties have agreed to the terms of 
this order as evidenced by the signatures below.” 
 
5. On the final page of the orders, the signatures of CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS and his 
previous attorney, DAN BACALIS, are not present on the document. 
 
6. The Petitioner refused to sign the orders to which he did not consent to on March 14th, 
2024. 
 
7. The orders were rendered on March 26th, 2024, as an agreement between the parties 
despite consent not being present at the time of rendition. 
 
8. The orders are void ab initio and have no legal effect. 
II. ARGUMENT 
A. An “Agreed” Order Without Actual Consent is Void Ab Initio 
9. Texas law is unequivocal that a judgment purporting to rest on an agreement of the 
parties cannot be rendered or enforced if one of the parties did not genuinely consent at the time 
of rendition. The consent of all parties at the time the court renders judgment is a prerequisite for

a valid agreed order. As the Texas Supreme Court has stated, a trial court cannot render a valid 
agreed judgment absent the consent of the parties at the time it is rendered, and the 
agreement can be revoked at any time before judgment is rendered on the agreement.  S & A 
Restaurant Corp. v. Leal, 892 S.W.2d 855, 857 (Tex.1995). This is so because a trial court cannot 
render a valid agreed judgment absent the consent of the parties at the time it is rendered. Padilla 
v. LaFrance, 907 S.W.2d 454, 461 (Tex.1995).  
10. In S&A Restaurant Corp. v. Leal, the Court reaffirmed that a party may revoke 
consent to a settlement at any time before judgment is rendered, and if a court nonetheless signs 
a judgment after consent has been revoked, “a judgment rendered after one party revokes his 
consent is void.” This rule reflects a fundamental principle: true consent is the linchpin of any 
agreed order. 
11. Here, Petitioner never consented to the order at the time they were entered. Indeed, 
his missing signature is a prima facie showing of this fact. Under these circumstances, it was 
error for the Court to sign the order as an “agreed” judgment, and the result is that the order 
is void ab initio. The Texas Supreme Court’s decision in Quintero v. Jim Walter Homes, Inc., 654 
S.W.2d 442 (Tex. 1983) is directly on point. In Quintero, the Court held that when a trial court 
has knowledge that one party does not consent to a judgment, the court “should refuse to 
sanction [the] agreement by making it the judgment of the court.” Id. By entering an order in 
the absence of Petitioner’s consent, the agreed judgment in this case was not just voidable—it is 
absolutely void from inception. In legal effect, there never was a valid temporary order at all, 
because the requisite meeting of the minds was absent. 
12. Texas courts of appeals have applied these principles in situations analogous to 
Petitioner’s, particularly in family law cases. For example, in In re E.B., No. 12-17-00214-CV

(Tex. App.—Tyler Oct. 18, 2017), the trial court had entered temporary orders incorporating a 
Rule 11 settlement agreement regarding conservatorship and possession of children. The father, 
however, had timely revoked his consent to that agreement. The Tyler Court of Appeals held that 
because the father withdrew consent before judgment, the agreed terms regarding 
conservatorship and possession were void. The appellate court unequivocally stated that the 
provisions of the temporary orders involving the children “are void, and the trial court abused 
its discretion in entering temporary orders based on the [purported] Agreement.” The court 
conditionally granted mandamus and directed the trial judge to vacate those portions of the 
temporary order.  
B. A Void Judgment is a Nullity and Can Be Challenged or Vacated at Any Time 
13. Because the temporary orders were entered without jurisdiction (i.e. without consent 
jurisdiction conferred by the parties’ agreement), the resulting “agreed” order is void. Under 
Texas law, a void judgment or order has no legal force or effect from the outset. It is “null” ab 
initio, and any person or court affected by it is entitled to treat it as a nullity. The Texas Supreme 
Court has explained that a void order is, in effect, no order at all: “[A] void judgment is a legal 
nullity . . . .” Alanis v. Barclays Capital Real Estate Inc., No. 04-17-00069-CV (Tex. App. Mar. 
27, 2017).  
14. Such a judgment may be collaterally attacked and set aside at any time, as it is not 
subject to ordinary procedural bars. Browning v. Placke, 698 S.W.2d 362 (Tex. 1985) (per 
curiam), is instructive on this point. In Browning, the Supreme Court recognized that courts of 
equal jurisdiction have the authority to declare a judgment void when it suffers from a 
fundamental defect (such as lack of jurisdiction or lack of consent). Here, this is a direct fit with 
the present situation.

C. Respondent’s most recent attempt to subvert the process 
 
15. On March 20th, 2025, Respondent filed an original answer and motion to consolidate 
through COOPER L. CARTER, which was prepared by RODERICK MARX. These filings are a 
direct showing of the Respondent’s game. She remains silent for months, and then at the first 
sign of her false narrative being under attack, she unleashes her attorney to file pleadings using 
the EFM Credentials of another individual not named in the suit – Roderick Marx – to prevent 
the relief duly entitled to Petitioner. 
 
16. Petitioner reminds this court that Respondent’s answer is clearly a boilerplate 
response template that doesn’t even address the core issues raised in the SAPCR. The first lines 
of the Response claim that Respondent has no driver’s license or social security number, which 
shows the rushed nature of her pleading in an attempt to defend the Respondent’s false narrative 
she has procured through fraud. 
 
17. Petitioner also points out that the Respondent wants to consolidate this matter with 
the divorce matter that is procedurally defunct, which would not be in the best interests of the 
children because it would move the matter back to the procedurally stalled case that hasn’t bene 
prosecuted by the same attorney who is requesting consolidation. Such would defeat the entire 
purpose of this suit, and would cause undue delay and prejudice the children and Petitioner. 
D. Request for immediate re-entry. 
 
18. Given the orders in question are facially void, Petitioner requests an immediate notice 
to be filed and served on the parties of record so that he may return home to his children, 
residence, and place of business until this matter can be set for a hearing. Petitioner’s unlawful 
exclusion from his residence creates further harm to the children each day it is left unaddressed.

The analysis concludes that: 
1. The divorce case should be dismissed for want of prosecution due to Petitioner's failure 
to advance the case for nearly a year 
2. The current orders are void due to lack of consent and improper adoption by the referring 
court 
3. The 322nd District Court never acquired continuing exclusive jurisdiction over the 
children 
4. The new SAPCR was properly filed as an original proceeding and should not be 
consolidated, especially considering no motion to transfer has been filed. 
5. Ms. Carter's pleadings should be stricken due to her failure to respond to a Rule 12 
challenge 
6. The children's best interests require immediate relief without further procedural delays

Ul. LEGAL ANALYSIS

A. Dismissal for Want of Prosecution

Legal Framework

1. Texas courts have authority to dismiss cases for want of prosecution under both Texas
Rule of Civil Procedure 165a and the court's inherent power to manage its docket. The Texas
Supreme Court recognized both bases for dismissal in Villarreal v. San Antonio Truck &

Equipment, 994 S.W.2d 628 (Tex. 1999).

2. A party seeking affirmative relief has a duty to prosecute the case with due diligence. 
As stated in In re Conner, 458 S.W.3d 532 (Tex. 2015), “[t]he issue here is whether a trial court 
abuses its discretion by refusing to grant a motion to dismiss for want of prosecution in the face 
of unmitigated and unexplained delay. We hold that it does.” Id. 
3. In family law specifically, In re Marriage of Buster, 115 S.W.3d 141 (Tex. App.—
Texarkana 2003) emphasized the importance of moving family law cases toward resolution and 
upheld dismissal after extended inactivity. 
Application to Current Case 
4. The facts strongly support dismissal for want of prosecution: 
i. 
The divorce case has been pending for over 16 months 
ii. Petitioner's attorney has failed to prosecute the case since April 24, 2024 
iii. No substantive action taken for approximately 11 months 
iv. No responses to discovery, no substantive pleadings, no trial settings 
v. The only recent action was filing a Motion to Consolidate to block emergency 
relief 
5. This extended inactivity is precisely the type of conduct that Texas courts have 
consistently held, which justifies dismissal for want of prosecution. The court should dismiss the 
dormant divorce case and allow the new SAPCR to proceed independently to address the 
children's urgent needs.

B. Void Orders Due to Lack of Consent 
Legal Framework 
6. The Texas Supreme Court established in Burnaman v. Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 
(Tex. 1951) that: "A valid consent judgment cannot be rendered by a court when consent of one 
of the parties is wanting. It is not sufficient to support the judgment that a party's consent thereto 
may at one time have been given; consent must exist at the very moment the court undertakes to 
make the agreement the judgment of the court." 
7. The Court further held: "When a trial court has knowledge that one of the parties to a 
suit does not consent to a judgment, it is error to render a judgment purportedly by agreement; 
such a judgment is a nullity." 
8. This principle was reaffirmed in Padilla v. LaFrance, 907 S.W.2d 454 (Tex. 1995), 
which confirmed that a trial court cannot render an agreed judgment after a party has withdrawn 
consent to a settlement. 
Application to Current Case 
9. The orders in this case are void under Burnaman and its progeny because: 
i. 
The orders claim consent of all parties but only bear signatures of the Petitioner 
and counsel 
ii. Respondent contends he never gave consent to the orders 
iii. Respondent actively opposed the terms that locked him out of his home and 
separated him from the children

iv. The court was aware of the dispute regarding consent (Respondent filed an 
emergency motion challenging the basis for agreement) 
10. Under Texas law, if Respondent did not consent to the orders at the time they were 
rendered, they are void ab initio. The court should declare these orders void and vacate them. 
C. Associate Judge's Orders Never Properly Adopted 
Legal Framework 
11. Texas Family Code § 201.013(b) explicitly states: "Except as provided by Section 
201.007 (Powers of Associate Judge), if a request for a de novo hearing before the referring court 
is not timely filed, the proposed order or judgment of the associate judge becomes the order or 
judgment of the referring court only on the referring court's signing the proposed order or 
judgment." 
12. This requirement is mandatory, not discretionary. Without the District Judge's 
signature, the Associate Judge's order remains merely a "proposed" order. 
Application to Current Case 
13. The orders in this case were issued by an Associate Judge but allegedly never 
properly adopted or signed by the referring District Court. Under Texas Family Code § 
201.013(b), these orders never achieved the status of a final judgment of the court and have no 
legal effect as final orders. 
14. This defect alone would be sufficient to challenge their validity, even without the 
consent issues. The court should declare these orders void or vacate them due to the lack of 
proper adoption by the referring court.

D. No Continuing Exclusive Jurisdiction (CEJ) 
Legal Framework 
15. Texas Family Code § 155.001(a) provides: "A court acquires continuing, exclusive 
jurisdiction over the matters provided for by this title in connection with a child on the rendition 
of a final order." 
16. Critically, § 155.001(d) states: "Unless a final order has been rendered by a court of 
continuing, exclusive jurisdiction, a subsequent suit shall be commenced as an original 
proceeding." 
17. In In re Burk, 252 S.W.3d 736 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2008), the court held 
that CEJ is established only upon rendition of a final order, and temporary orders do not establish 
CEJ. 
Application to Current Case 
18. No final order was ever rendered in the divorce case because: 
i. 
The Associate Judge's orders were never properly signed by the referring District 
Court Judge (per § 201.013(b)) 
ii. The orders were void due to lack of consent (per Burnaman v. Heaton) 
19. Without a final order, the 322nd District Court never acquired CEJ over the children. 
Therefore, under § 155.001(d), the Respondent's new SAPCR was properly "commenced as an 
original proceeding" in the 233rd District Court. 
20. The motion to consolidate should be denied because the 322nd District Court does 
not have dominant jurisdiction over the children.

E. Exceptions to Dominant Jurisdiction 
Legal Framework 
           21. Generally, when two suits involving the same subject matter are pending in different 
courts of equal jurisdiction, the court in which the suit was first filed has dominant jurisdiction. 
However, the Texas Supreme Court in Wyatt v. Shaw Plumbing Co., 760 S.W.2d 245, 247 (Tex. 
1988) recognized three exceptions to this rule: 
i. Conduct by a party that estops them from asserting prior active jurisdiction 
ii. Lack of persons to be joined if feasible 
iii. Lack of intent to prosecute the first lawsuit 
Application to Current Case 
         22. Even if the 322nd District Court had dominant jurisdiction (which it does not due to 
lack of CEJ), at least two exceptions to the first-filed rule apply: 
Estoppel by Conduct: 
i. 
Petitioner allowed the case to become completely dormant 
ii. Failed to comply with Rule 237a's notice requirements after federal remand 
iii. Effectively concealed the revival of the state case 
iv. Represented through inaction that she had abandoned the case

that case was initiated specifically to address the children's urgent needs, free from the 
entanglements of the stalled divorce. 
F. Attorney Misconduct - Rule 12 Challenge 
Legal Framework 
24. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12 provides that a party may file a sworn motion 
stating that they believe a suit is being prosecuted or defended without authority. The challenged 
attorney bears the burden of proving authority to act. If the attorney fails to show authority, the 
court "shall refuse to permit the attorney to appear in the cause and shall strike the pleadings if 
no person who is authorized to prosecute or defend appears." 
25. These consequences are mandatory, not discretionary. The court has no choice but to 
bar the attorney and strike the pleadings upon failure to show authority. 
Application to Current Case 
26. Respondent filed a verified Rule 12 motion on September 20, 2024, challenging 
Cooper L. Carter's authority. Ms. Carter has not responded to this challenge for over 6 months.

Rule 237a Violations 
30. After federal remand on December 6, 2024, Ms. Carter failed to: 
i. 
File the required certified copy of the remand order with the clerk 
ii. Provide Respondent with mandatory written notice of the remand 
31. This procedural violation prevents the case from moving forward properly and further 
demonstrates Ms. Carter's neglect of basic procedural duties. 
Abuse of Process 
31. Ms. Carter's sudden reappearance after nearly a year of inactivity solely to block 
emergency relief suggests improper purpose. Filing a Motion to Consolidate without addressing 
substantive issues appears designed to delay resolution rather than advance the case. 
This conduct violates: 
i. 
Rule 13 of Texas Rules of Civil Procedure (forbidding groundless filings brought 
in bad faith) 
ii. Texas Disciplinary Rule 3.02 (prohibiting positions that unreasonably delay 
resolution)

This paramount standard must guide all decisions in cases involving children. 
Application to Current Case 
33. The children in this case are suffering ongoing harm: 
i. 
Subjected to psychological manipulation and medical neglect 
ii. Left home alone at night without supervision 
iii. Removed from Respondent's care and placed with elderly great-grandparents 
iv. Eldest child's academic performance has plummeted 
v. Emotionally estranged from both parents 
34. Every day that passes without corrective action leaves the children in an unstable, 
harmful environment. Consolidation would reward procedural stonewalling and cause further 
delay. The children's best interests require prompt resolution, which can only be achieved by 
denying consolidation, dismissing the dormant divorce case, and allowing the new SAPCR to 
proceed expeditiously. 
III. CONCLUSION AND RELIEF REQUESTED 
Based on the comprehensive legal analysis above, there are multiple independent grounds 
supporting the Respondent's entitlement to relief: 
1. The divorce case should be dismissed for want of prosecution under Rule 165a and the

This paramount standard must guide all decisions in cases involving children.
Application to Current Case
33. The children in this case are suffering ongoing harm:

i. Subjected to psychological manipulation and medical neglect

_.
Ee:

Left home alone at night without supervision

em.

iii Removed from Respondent's care and placed with elderly great-grandparents

<

Eldest child's academic performance has plummeted
v. Emotionally estranged from both parents

34. Every day that passes without corrective action leaves the children in an unstable,
harmful environment. Consolidation would reward procedural stonewalling and cause further
delay. The children's best interests require prompt resolution, which can only be achieved by
denying consolidation, dismissing the dormant divorce case, and allowing the new SAPCR to

proceed expeditiously.

Il. CONCLUSION AND RELIEF REQUESTED

Based on the comprehensive legal analysis above, there are multiple independent grounds

supporting the Respondent's entitlement to relief:

1. The divorce case should be dismissed for want of prosecution under Rule 165a and the

court's inherent power.

2. The current orders are void due to lack of consent under Burnaman v. Heaton.

3. The Associate Judge's orders were never properly adopted under Texas Family Code § 
201.013(b). 
4. The 322nd District Court never acquired CEJ under Texas Family Code § 155.001. 
5. Exceptions to dominant jurisdiction apply under Wyatt v. Shaw Plumbing Co. 
6. Ms. Carter's pleadings should be stricken due to her failure to respond to a Rule 12 
challenge. 
7. Ms. Carter has engaged in multiple instances of misconduct warranting sanctions and 
referral to the State Bar. 
8. The children's best interests require immediate relief without further procedural delays 
Therefore, the Respondent is entitled to the following relief: 
i. Denial of Petitioner's Motion to Consolidate. 
ii. Declaration that the current orders are void and of no legal effect. 
iii. Dismissal of the divorce action (Cause No. 322-744263-23) for want of prosecution. 
iv. Striking of all pleadings filed by Cooper L. Carter due to her failure to show 
authority. 
v. Permission for the new SAPCR to proceed in the 233rd District Court to address the 
children's urgent needs. 
These remedies are supported by well-established Texas law and are necessary to protect the 
children's best interests, ensure procedural fairness, and maintain the integrity of the legal 
process. Without any opposition, the court has every ability to act.
