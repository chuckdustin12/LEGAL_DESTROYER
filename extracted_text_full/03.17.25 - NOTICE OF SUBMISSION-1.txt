9. Most disturbing is that this settlement agreement permitted the Petitioner 
to remove her children from their own home for an entire month – a clear 
disregard for their well being – and the court signed off on this. 
 
10. Further, this agreement was challenged via a motion to reconsider which 
was denied on March 14th, 2024, but Judge Kaitcer. 
 
11. To date, no findings of fact or conclusions of law have been issued 
regarding this ruling despite notifying the court that they are past-due. 
 
12. At the hearing on March 14th, 2024, the docket reflects only the 
Respondent appearing before the court. 
 
13. Just prior to the hearing, Respondent was served the current orders by 
COOPER L. CARTER, not DAN BACALIS, just minutes before the hearing was 
to commence that was filed to challenge them. 
 
14. Despite the agreement stating that a typed written order shall be 
prepared by Dan Bacalis, despite the 20 day time limit, and despite the five day 
review period that all parties and Judge Kaitcer agreed to -  the orders were 
permitted to be prepared at the last minute by COOPER L. CARTER, well after the 
20-day deadline, and despite the Respondent’s consent not being present, he was 
ordered to sign the agreement in violation of Texas Law by 1:30 P.M. that same
