minor children; related to Cause No. 322-744263-23, In re Marriage of Myers) 
Dear Mr. Wilder and Honorable Court: 
Please accept for filing the enclosed Original SAPCR concerning the above-referenced 
children. This SAPCR is intentionally filed as a new, separate case, rather than under the 
existing divorce cause, due to unique procedural defects in that divorce proceeding that have left 
the children in legal and physical limbo. Immediate intervention is required to protect the 
children’s best interests. Below, I outline the compelling reasons – supported by law and the 
record – why this SAPCR must proceed separately and be set for an emergency hearing at 
once, instead of being merged into the stalled divorce case. 
A. Failure of Opposing Party to Prosecute
1. The divorce Petitioner has wholly failed to prosecute the divorce, leaving it in
procedural limbo. Over a year has passed with no meaningful activity toward a final resolution. 
Notably, after the divorce case was removed to federal court and later remanded, Petitioner 
never filed the required certified Order of Remand or gave notice of remand as mandated by 
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 237a. Rule 237a obligates the removing party to promptly file the 
federal remand order with the state clerk and notify all parties, after which any defendant has 15 
days to answer. Petitioner’s omission of this required step has left the state court record 
incomplete and the case procedurally suspended. Indeed, due to Petitioner’s inaction (and her

Re: Original Petition in Suit Affecting Parent-Child Relationship (“SAPCR”) — Request to
File as Separate Case and Set Immediate Hearing (In the Interest of [M.M.] and [C.M.],
minor children; related to Cause No. 322-744263-23, In re Marriage of Myers)

Dear Mr. Wilder and Honorable Court:

Please accept for filing the enclosed Original SAPCR concerning the above-referenced
children. This SAPCR is intentionally filed as a new, separate case, rather than under the
existing divorce cause, due to unique procedural defects in that divorce proceeding that have left
the children in legal and physical limbo. Immediate intervention is required to protect the
children’s best interests. Below, I outline the compelling reasons — supported by law and the
record — why this SAPCR must proceed separately and be set for an emergency hearing at

once, instead of being merged into the stalled divorce case.

A. Failure of Opposing Party to Prosecute

1. The divorce Petitioner has wholly failed to prosecute the divorce, leaving it in
procedural limbo. Over a year has passed with no meaningful activity toward a final resolution.
Notably, after the divorce case was removed to federal court and later remanded, Petitioner
never filed the required certified Order of Remand or gave notice of remand as mandated by
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 237a. Rule 237a obligates the removing party to promptly file the
federal remand order with the state clerk and notify all parties, after which any defendant has 15
days to answer. Petitioner’s omission of this required step has left the state court record

incomplete and the case procedurally suspended. Indeed, due to Petitioner’s inaction (and her

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
counsel’s apparent inability to e-file; see Point 8 below), no remand notice was ever filed, so 
the divorce court has not resumed jurisdiction in any practical sense. 
2. In addition, Petitioner has ignored the Texas Supreme Court’s time standards for 
timely disposition of cases. A divorce case is expected to be resolved within 12 months, yet 
Petitioner has made no effort to advance it. She has not set a trial or even a status conference; she 
has allowed critical deadlines to lapse. This lack of diligence violates the duty to prosecute one’s 
claims and warrants dismissal for want of prosecution. In fact, Respondent has been forced to 
file a Motion to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution (pending before the Court) detailing 
Petitioner’s complete failure to move the case forward. This also remains un-responded to. 
Petitioner’s inaction has left the family with no active forum to address urgent child-related 
issues. Therefore, a separate SAPCR is necessary to provide a functioning vehicle for relief. 
The children cannot wait for the Petitioner’s indifference or strategic delay to abate. 
B. Failure to Oppose Any Relief (Legal Concession) 
3. Throughout the divorce case, Petitioner has not opposed or responded to any of 
Respondent’s filings, motions, or claims for relief. She and her counsel have remained silent in 
the face of serious allegations and requests, effectively conceding the merits of those issues 
under Texas law. Respondent has raised grave claims of fraud, perjury, deception, and child 
neglect against Petitioner in his pleadings, yet Petitioner’s counsel has filed no response or 
defense to these claims. Respondent also served discovery and Requests for Admissions which 
went completely unanswered, resulting in deemed admissions. He even filed a motion to 
compel discovery, which Petitioner again did not oppose, though unfortunately no hearing has 
yet been held. Moreover, when Respondent moved for other interim relief (including return to 
the family home and expanded access to the children), Petitioner filed no opposition. By her

inaction, Petitioner has implicitly admitted the validity of Respondent’s factual assertions and 
the justness of his requests.  
4. Texas law is clear that a party who fails to respond to motions or claims effectively 
waives any objection and accepts the movant’s evidence as true. For example, in the 
summary judgment context, if a nonmovant files no response, the court may accept the movant’s 
asserted facts as uncontroverted and render judgment if entitlement is shown; issues not timely 
raised in a written response are waived; see Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c). The same principle applies 
here: Petitioner’s total failure to contest Respondent’s filings is tantamount to a legal concession 
of those matters. In other words, failure to make timely and specific objections results in waiver 
of the objections. See Clark v. Trailways, Inc., 774 S.W.2d 644, 647 (Tex. 1989), cert. denied, 
493 U.S. 1074, 110 S.Ct. 1122, 107 L.Ed.2d 1028 (1990); Hartford Accident and Indem. Co. v. 
McCardell, 369 S.W.2d 331, 335 (Tex. 1963); Srite v. Owens-Illinois, Inc., 870 S.W.2d 556, 565 
(Tex.App. — Houston [1st Dist.] 1993), revised on other grounds, 897 S.W.2d 765). Courts have 
recognized that a party’s failure to respond indicates a belief that the motion has merit.  
5. Petitioner’s silence speaks volumes. She has never disputed that Respondent should be 
allowed to return home or see his children – in fact, she has not opposed any relief requested. 
This silence should be treated as acquiescence. Accordingly, there is no reason to keep the 
children waiting in the paralytic divorce case when no one is even arguing against the relief 
Respondent seeks in this SAPCR. The SAPCR can and should proceed on the uncontroverted 
facts in Respondent’s filings.

6. Every day that passes with the children separated from their father is a day of 
irreparable harm. The undisputed evidence is that the children are suffering due to 
Respondent’s forced absence from the home. In the months since he was excluded, the children’s 
well-being has precipitously declined: they have fallen behind in school, missed critical medical 
and dental appointments, and have been emotionally traumatized by the sudden and prolonged 
separation from their father. No party—not even Petitioner—has asserted that the children would 
be anything but better off if their father could return to care for them. No one has argued against 
Respondent’s return to the home or his involvement in the children’s daily life. It is axiomatic 
that the best interest of the children is the paramount concern in any case affecting the parent-
child relationship. See Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002 (mandating that “[t]he best interest of the 
child shall always be the primary consideration of the court in determining the issues of 
conservatorship and possession of and access to the child”); Lenz v. Lenz, 79 S.W.3d 10, 14 
(Tex. 2002) (emphasizing that courts must place “predominant emphasis” on what best serves the 
children's welfare, particularly focusing on stability, emotional and educational needs, and 
maintaining frequent contact with fit parents). 
7. The Texas Legislature explicitly prioritized children’s best interests in all 
conservatorship and possession determinations: “The best interest of the child shall always be 
the primary consideration of the court in determining the issues of conservatorship and 
possession of and access to the child.” Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002. Texas Supreme Court 
jurisprudence confirms and expands upon this legislative directive, instructing courts to consider 
stability, educational continuity, emotional health, and ongoing relationships with fit parents in 
their best-interest analysis. See Lenz, 79 S.W.3d at 14–15 (holding courts must evaluate what

will best serve the child’s overall welfare, ensuring a stable and emotionally supportive 
environment and maintaining meaningful and frequent parental contact). 
8. Here, it is unquestionably in the children's best interests to have their loving father 
back in their daily lives without further delay. Texas public policy explicitly states that children 
should have frequent and continuing contact with parents who have demonstrated the ability to 
act in their best interest. See Tex. Fam. Code § 153.001(a) (declaring the public policy of 
Texas to ensure frequent contact and shared duties between parents and children following 
separation); Lenz, 79 S.W.3d at 14–15 (affirming that Texas policy favors maintaining 
frequent and meaningful parental involvement in a child's life). 
9. Respondent has demonstrated throughout these proceedings that he is a caring, fit 
parent whose presence provides the children with stability, support for their education and health, 
and emotional security. By contrast, the children’s current situation—living apart from 
Respondent for no substantiated reason—is destabilizing and harmful. Texas courts recognize the 
urgency of child custody matters and have repeatedly underscored that “justice demands a 
speedy resolution of child custody and child support issues.” In re Tex. Dep’t of Fam. & 
Protective Servs., 210 S.W.3d 609, 613 (Tex. 2006) (orig. proceeding) (quoting Proffer v. 
Yates, 734 S.W.2d 673, 674 (Tex. 1987)). Simply put, the children’s needs cannot wait on 
procedural formalities or a dormant divorce case. Their welfare requires this SAPCR to be heard 
immediately so that orders can be promptly put in place to reunite them with their father and 
address their academic, emotional, and medical needs. No statute or rule forbids initiating a 
separate SAPCR when it is necessary to protect children's best interests. Indeed, Tex. Fam. Code 
§ 153.002 and the overarching equitable duty of the Court compel swift action here. Respondent 
is ready, willing, and able to resume caring for his children, and no party has objected to him

doing so. Therefore, the Court must accept this SAPCR and schedule an immediate hearing to 
serve the children's best interests without further delay. See Lenz, 79 S.W.3d at 14–15 (holding 
courts must prioritize swift judicial actions in custody matters, protecting the best interests of 
children). 
D. Fraud and Perjury Render the Prior Orders Void 
10. The orders entered in the divorce case that currently keep Respondent out of the home 
and away from the children were obtained through fraud, misrepresentation, and even 
perjury. Because those orders were procured by wrongful means, they are void ab initio and 
cannot be permitted to stand in the way of this SAPCR. Texas law does not tolerate court orders 
obtained by trickery or false pretenses. Notably, the temporary orders in the divorce (signed 
January 16, 2024 and later on March 14, 2024) were presented to the Court as “agreed” orders, 
yet Respondent never agreed to them and never signed them. In fact, Respondent had 
expressly opposed the relief in those orders. The “agreement” was a fiction created by 
Petitioner’s counsel. The record reflects that Petitioner’s counsel drafted and submitted those 
orders without Respondent’s consent or signature, and which reference a hearing not found on 
the docket. This is a textbook example of a fraud on the court. A judgment or order entered as 
“agreed” when one party actually objected is void. The Texas Supreme Court’s holding in 
Burnaman v. Heaton is directly on point: when a trial court knows a party does not consent to a 
purported agreed judgment, it must refuse to sign it; any judgment rendered under such 
circumstances “is void.” Burnaman v. Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 (Tex. 1951). 
 11. Here, the court was misled – it was never disclosed that Respondent vehemently 
disagreed. Without such consent the judgment is void. The law will not give effect to a

was rife with material falsehoods. In her filings, Petitioner knowingly made false statements to 
the Court to justify excluding Respondent from the home. For example, in her Application for 
Protective Order and supporting affidavit, Petitioner grossly misrepresented the facts, painting 
Respondent as a danger without evidence. She alleged incidents that never occurred or twisted 
mundane events into false claims of “family violence.” These misrepresentations were later 
exposed, and Petitioner has never attempted to prove them in any evidentiary hearing. 
Petitioner’s intent was plainly to deceive the Court into granting her sole occupancy of the home 
and custody of the children. Indeed, Respondent’s pending Motion to Dismiss details how 
Petitioner “knowingly made and presented fraudulent claims to the Court regarding 
Respondent’s property, with the intent to deprive him of his interest in his home”, and how 
she acted with intent that “these false claims be given the same legal effect as valid court orders, 
misleading the Court and causing Respondent to be wrongfully deprived of his home and 
livelihood.” 
 
12. These strong findings, which stand uncontroverted, show that the prior orders were 
procured by fraud and deception. Under longstanding Texas precedent, any order obtained by 
extrinsic fraud (fraud that effectively prevents a fair presentation of the case) is void and a 
nullity. See King Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman, 118 S.W.3d 742, 751–52 (Tex. 2003) (judgment 
obtained by fraud can be set aside; only extrinsic fraud – such as keeping a party away from 
court or concealing critical facts – justifies relief).  
13. Here, Petitioner’s fraud was extrinsic in that it kept Respondent from participating 
fully (the “agreed” order ploy) and kept the Court from learning the true facts. A litigant who 
lies to gain advantage in a court order subverts the process; the resulting order lacks integrity 
and is void.

14. In sum, the prior temporary orders that ousted Respondent were built on a 
foundation of fraud. They should carry no weight and pose no obstacle to granting relief in this 
new SAPCR. This Court not only has the authority to declare such orders void, it has a duty to 
do so in order to prevent manifest injusticec. See Burnaman, 240 S.W.2d at 291. By proceeding 
with a fresh SAPCR, the Court can consider the issues regarding the children de novo, on truthful 
evidence, untainted by the false premises of the earlier orders. Equity regards as done that which 
ought to have been done – the Court should restore Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, 
(Petitioner in the new cause) to his rightful place in the home and children’s lives, as if the 
fraudulent orders had never been entered. 
E. Restoring the True Status Quo of the Family 
15. Relief in this SAPCR is also warranted to restore the status quo that existed before 
Petitioner’s improper actions. The “last actual, peaceable status quo” in this family was 
Respondent living in the home with the children, as a present and active father. That was the 
reality until late 2023, when Petitioner – through unilateral false allegations – removed 
Respondent from the household. Texas law holds that the purpose of temporary orders and 
injunctive relief is to maintain or restore the status quo pending trial. See In re Shifflet, 462 
S.W.3d 528, 537 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2015, orig. proceeding) (courts aim to restore 
the last peaceable status quo pending final trial). 
16. Here, the true status quo ante was the intact family unit with Respondent present. 
The situation now – Respondent barred from the home and children – is a drastic deviation from 
that status quo, achieved only by contested court orders that, as shown, lack validity. Every day 
that Respondent is kept out is a day the family’s natural equilibrium is disturbed further.

Texas courts have intervened in analogous situations to return to the rightful status quo. For 
example, when one party’s unilateral conduct disrupts a long-standing living arrangement, courts 
recognize that stability must be restored for the benefit of all, especially the children. See Smith 
v. McDaniel, 842 S.W.2d 7, 12 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1992, no writ) (courts should preserve or 
restore the conditions that existed prior to the controversy to protect the children’s routine and 
sense of security). Here, restoring the status quo means allowing Respondent back into his 
home and parenting role immediately. That was the “last peaceable” situation before litigation 
– a state in which the children were thriving. Notably, the findings in the temporary orders 
hearing (held without Respondent) even indicate there were no findings of any imminent harm if 
Respondent were present; the exclusion was based solely on Petitioner’s requested relief, not on 
proven misconduct by Respondent.  
17. Thus, there is no safety-based reason to maintain the current deviation from the norm. 
By contrast, there are powerful reasons to return to normalcy: the children’s suffering would be 
alleviated, and the family’s balance and stability would be reestablished. 
18. In short, equity demands that we “undo” the improper disruption caused by 
Petitioner’s actions. This SAPCR allows the Court to do exactly that – to realign temporary 
orders with reality and justice. In re Shifflet instructs that the last peaceable status quo should 
be restored pending trial. The last peaceable status was Respondent in the home; restoring that 
will harm no one (again, even Petitioner did not claim any abuse or violence requiring exclusion 
– her application acknowledged no recent violence, only vague fears). Maintaining the current 
situation, by contrast, gravely harms the children and prejudices Respondent’s relationship with 
them. Therefore, the Court should use the SAPCR proceeding to immediately reinstate

serves the children’s welfare. Every additional day away from that status quo is a deviation that 
this Court can and should correct now. 
F. The Court’s Duty to Act Without Delay for the Children’s Welfare 
19. By accepting this SAPCR as a separate case, the Court can fulfill its paramount duty 
to protect the children’s welfare without procedural delay. Courts have a sacred obligation 
to put the interests of children above rigid procedural considerations, especially in emergencies. 
The Texas Supreme Court has emphasized that trial courts must act immediately when 
children’s physical or emotional well-being is at stake, even if procedural complexities exist. 
In In re Tex. Department of Family & Protective Services, for example, the Supreme Court 
admonished that delays in custody matters are intolerable, quoting with approval the maxim: 
“Justice demands a speedy resolution of child custody and child support issues.” 210 S.W.3d 
609, 613 (Tex. 2006). The high court in that case (a mandamus proceeding) required prompt 
action despite procedural entanglements, recognizing that a child’s need for a stable, safe 
environment cannot be made to wait on protracted litigation maneuvers. 
20. Similarly, in Elizondo v. Monteleone, an appellate court noted that when a parent 
attempted procedural gambits to delay a custody determination, the court system should not 
allow those tactics to trump the child’s immediate needs. Elizondo v. Monteleone, 96 S.W.3d 705, 
708 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2002, no pet.) (courts will not permit jurisdictional technicalities 
to delay emergency relief in a parent-child case). [(If citation is verified)] In that case, one party 
tried to remove the case to federal court and argued that the state court lacked jurisdiction to 
issue temporary orders during the interim. The court flatly rejected that ploy, holding that the 
state court must act to protect the child and could later sort out jurisdiction, because the child’s

welfare was paramount. The lesson is clear: procedural fencing cannot override the need for 
immediate judicial action when children are suffering. 
21. Here, Petitioner’s inaction and the snares of the divorce case have already delayed 
relief for far too long. The children have been without their father for several critical months of 
their development. The Court has the power—and indeed the duty—to cut through the 
procedural morass by creating a new SAPCR docket and promptly addressing the merits of 
conservatorship, possession, and access. There is no jurisdictional barrier to doing so: this Court 
has continuing jurisdiction over the children (by virtue of the ongoing divorce) and thus can hear 
a SAPCR involving them. Any concern about duplicitous litigation is mitigated by the fact that 
the divorce case is effectively moribund; furthermore, Respondent will move to consolidate or 
dismiss the divorce once the SAPCR is in place, if appropriate. What cannot be allowed is more 
delay that leaves the children in a fractured situation. Our Courts are courts of equity as well 
as law, especially in family matters. When equity demands immediate intervention, the Court 
should not hesitate. As the Austin Court of Appeals observed, “when the jurisdiction of the court 
has been properly invoked in matters affecting minor children, the court’s primary consideration 
is the best interest of the children, and the court may enter any order deemed necessary to 
protect and conserve the welfare of the child.” Elizondo, 96 S.W.3d at 708 (citing Tex. Fam. 
Code § 105.001 on temporary orders for a child). In other words, once the Court is aware of a 
child in need, it must act, and act swiftly.  
22. That is precisely the situation here. By accepting this SAPCR filing and setting an 
immediate hearing, the Court will be performing its highest duty: safeguarding the children’s

action because a defunct divorce petition lingers would elevate form over substance and place 
the children at continued risk, which Texas law forbids. 
23. In sum, this Court is empowered and required to provide a forum for immediate 
relief, and the SAPCR is the proper mechanism to do so. The Court should therefore promptly 
docket this SAPCR as a new case and schedule an emergency hearing on temporary orders for 
the children. 
G. Protective-Order Application Confirms Respondent’s Joint Ownership of the Home 
24. Even Petitioner’s own filings acknowledge Respondent’s legal right to return to the 
residence. In her sworn Application for Protective Order (filed in September 2023), Petitioner 
explicitly affirmed that the marital residence “is jointly owned or leased by the Applicant and 
Respondent.” 
25. This judicial admission is significant. It means that at the time she sought exclusive 
use of the home, Petitioner conceded that Respondent is co-owner (or co-leaseholder) of the 
property. There is no dispute, therefore, that Respondent has an equal property interest and 
legal right to occupy the home. Petitioner cannot now contradict her own sworn statement by 
suggesting Respondent has no such right. 
26. Why is this important? Because the prior orders granting Petitioner exclusive 
possession of the home (and excluding Respondent) stand in direct conflict with the parties’ 
property rights and the status quo. Those orders were based not on any finding that Respondent 
lacked ownership or rights to the home, but presumably on a temporary need for protection 
(which, as shown, was falsely claimed). With the exposure of Petitioner’s allegations as false, 
there remains no lawful basis to keep Respondent out of a home that he owns jointly. Texas

Family Code § 153.003 states that the Court cannot condition a parent’s possession of a child on 
the payment of support or other matters unrelated to the child – likewise, the Court should not 
condition Respondent’s access to his home (and thereby to his children) on a procedurally flawed 
prior order, especially when Petitioner herself admits the home is community property. The 
protective order application further underscores that Petitioner’s sole claim to the home was 
through a temporary court order, not any independent right. When the predicate for that 
temporary order (alleged family violence) is unproven and disputed, the underlying property 
rights must prevail. 
27. In equity, where two parties have equal right to possession of a property, one cannot 
exclude the other absent a valid court order supported by good cause. Here, absent the now-
questionable temporary orders, Respondent as joint owner would be free to live in his home. The 
Court should thus give weight to Petitioner’s admission of joint ownership and recognize 
Respondent’s unabated property right. This is yet another reason to allow the SAPCR to go 
forward: so that the issue of residency and possession of the home can be revisited in light of the 
true facts and rights of the parties. The protective order was leveraged into a settlement which 
both parties did not agree to (as the record will show, if needed), meaning no long-term 
restrictions were found warranted. What remains is a fit father who co-owns his home seeking to 
return to his necessity to work and provide financially for the children. Petitioner’s own 
pleadings remove any doubt about his entitlement. Accordingly, the Clerk and Court should not 
hesitate to facilitate Respondent’s return via new temporary orders in this SAPCR, as even 
Petitioner’s sworn statements support Respondent’s position.

H. Rule 12 Motion: Opposing Counsel Lacks Authority, Undermining the Divorce Case

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Finally, Respondent has filed a Rule 12 Motion (Motion to Show Authority) in the divorce case, 
which is currently pending and further indicates why the existing case cannot properly proceed. 
In that motion (filed September 20, 2024), Respondent challenged the authority of Petitioner’s 
attorney of record to act on her behalf.  
28. This challenge was not made lightly – it is supported by evidence that Petitioner’s 
counsel never filed the pleadings, is not authorized to practice in this matter under her current 
registration, and may not even have a valid engagement with Petitioner. Notably, since that 
motion was filed, Petitioner’s counsel has failed to respond to it or otherwise prove her 
authority. Rule 12 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provides that an attorney challenged by 
such a motion must appear and show authority to act for the client, or else be struck from the 
case. Petitioner’s counsel has not met this burden. Instead, irregularities have abounded: at a 
recent hearing (on Respondent’s motion to recuse), Petitioner’s counsel appeared without 
having answered the Rule 12 motion, and the Court allowed her to argue on a motion she did 
not respond to, but her authority remains in question.. Moreover, it came to light that Petitioner’s 
counsel has been unable to e-file pleadings on her client’s behalf because her electronic filing 
account is in disarray (registered under a former employer’s email at Cantey Hanger yet is 
signing pleadings for Marx, Altman, & Johnson) . In fact, the few documents “filed” in the 
divorce case on Petitioner’s side were filed by Roderick Marx, not by the attorney herself. And 
tellingly, Petitioner’s counsel failed to file the Notice of Remand after the federal court sent the 
case back, leaving the case hanging indefinitely. All of this demonstrates that Petitioner’s counsel 
is effectively not acting with proper authority or competence in the divorce matter. 
29. This is critical because if Petitioner’s attorney lacks authority, then Petitioner is

29. This is critical because if Petitioner’s attorney lacks authority, then Petitioner is

essentially unrepresented in the divorce. Her pleadings (including the Original Petition for

Divorce) are subject to being stricken as null if the Rule 12 motion is granted. The entire divorce 
proceeding would be a nullity without an authorized petitioner or counsel – which is another 
reason it has stagnated. It would be unjust to make the children wait for months while this issue 
is sorted out. By contrast, in a new SAPCR, Petitioner can secure proper counsel or proceed pro 
se, but the Rule 12 quagmire in the divorce case can be sidestepped for now to get the children 
relief. The pending Rule 12 motion underscores that the divorce case is on unstable footing. It 
is procedurally snarled by questions of representation. On the other hand, Respondent is ready to 
proceed in the SAPCR immediately – he, as the petitioner in the SAPCR, obviously has 
authority to bring it, and he will serve Petitioner directly. If Petitioner’s prior counsel truly has no 
authority, Petitioner will have to either hire new counsel or represent herself in responding to the 
SAPCR, but at least the case will move forward. The Rule 12 fiasco in the divorce should not be 
allowed to delay relief for the children. Equity again favors moving to a forum (the SAPCR) 
where all parties before the Court are indisputably authorized and the merits can be reached 
without distraction. 
30. In summary on this point, Respondent’s Rule 12 motion (which remains unanswered) 
indicates that the opposing attorney “has no authority to act for the party” – a situation which, 
by rule, would mandate striking her pleadings and possibly dismissing the divorce. Rather than 
let the case devolve into that chaos (to the children’s detriment), the Court should start fresh with 
this SAPCR. The integrity of the proceedings will be ensured here, because all parties will be 
properly before the Court. Respondent is confident that once this SAPCR is active, Petitioner

Notice of Temporary EX-Parte TRO
2 messages
FUDSTOP <chuckdustin12@gmail.com>
Fri, Mar 21, 2025 at 10:44 PM
To: Cooper Carter <coopercarter@majadmin.com>
Ms. Carter,
Pursuant to Tarrant County Local Rule 3.30(c)  , this letter provides notice that I intend to present an Emergency Ex
Parte Application for Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) seeking immediate relief in the interest of my children’s well-
being and to prevent irreparable harm to my property, family relationships, and ability to earn a living.
The TRO will NOT request exclusive temporary use of the marital residence but that if your client has issue, she has
alternative housing and has used possession of the residence to damage my livelihood and restrict my parenting time.
The application will include verified evidence supporting the necessity of immediate relief, including:
Verified communications acknowledging my need for the home to work
Records of financial losses from displacement (Airbnb receipts, business losses, etc.)
Evidence of your client disposing of or concealing my personal property
Proof that the children have been left unsupervised overnight by your client on multiple occasions.
Documentation from the school showing excessive absences and academic concerns regarding Mara.
Text evidence between myself and the multiple AIRBNB hosts showcasing the difficulty faced in setting up
operations outside of the reliable setup of the house.
Photographs and texts contradicting claims made in previous pleadings

Ms. Carter,

Pursuant to Tarrant County Local Rule 3.30(c) , this letter provides notice that | intend to present an Emergency Ex
Parte Application for Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) seeking immediate relief in the interest of my children’s well-
being and to prevent irreparable harm to my property, family relationships, and ability to earn a living.

The TRO will NOT request exclusive temporary use of the marital residence but that if your client has issue, she has
alternative housing and has used possession of the residence to damage my livelihood and restrict my parenting time.
The application will include verified evidence supporting the necessity of immediate relief, including:

e Verified communications acknowledging my need for the home to work

¢ Records of financial losses from displacement (Airbnb receipts, business losses, etc.)

e Evidence of your client disposing of or concealing my personal property

e Proof that the children have been left unsupervised overnight by your client on multiple occasions.

¢ Documentation from the school showing excessive absences and academic concerns regarding Mara.

e Text evidence between myself and the multiple AIRBNB hosts showcasing the difficulty faced in setting up

operations outside of the reliable setup of the house.

Photographs and texts contradicting claims made in previous pleadings

Dental neglect of my youngest daughter (photos of untreated cavities)

Financial documents showing | paid all vehicle and rent obligations, contrary to your client’s claims

Text messages between myself and the grandparents of your client showing we can be amicable during this

situation and put the children first.

e Photo evidence showing the only way | have to communicate with my daughters is via an online game, ROBLOX,
due to your client preventing communications.

¢ My criminal record showing that | have never been convicted of a violent crime.

e The current temporary orders which are facially void and can be collaterally attacked in any court at any time.

Again, there is absolutely zero reason to have me barred from the residence and strip the children of their parents. It
contradicts the lodestone of the Family Code which is in the best interests of the children.

This is the more logical solution. If we pursued this route in the beginning, we'd already be divorced and the children's
financial stability wouldn't have been sacrificed. There is no risk of danger. There is no risk of harm to the children. There
is only the possibility of recovery. That is in their best interests.

There is no legal reason your client has to want me out of the house other than just that. She cannot unilaterally decide
that | agree to everything and then do as she pleases with my personal belongings and neglect the children in multiple
areas.

Your argument that | agreed to the orders in place falls flat on its face for many reasons which will not be repeated here.

| am providing this notice strictly to comply with Local Rule 11(e). | will proceed to present the application to the Court

Cooper,
Petitioner (your client) filed the original divorce petition in December 2023 in the 322nd District Court (Cause No. 322-
744263-23). In that petition, she alleged false claims of family violence and sought a waiver of the 60-day waiting
period for divorce, ostensibly to expedite temporary relief by labeling me as an abuser and claiming she had an active
order of protection against me at the time of filing. 
On February 1, 2024, a temporary orders hearing was held before an Associate Judge. The parties (through counsel)
announced an apparent agreement on temporary custody and other matters. The associate judge signed an “Associate
Judge’s Report for Temporary Orders”, titled as “Agreed Temporary Orders.” Importantly, this report did not itself
constitute a signed court order; instead, it outlined the agreed terms and directed further action before any order would
be final. Specifically, the report stated that Respondent's attorney (Dan Bacalis) would prepare a formal temporary
orders document, which would be prepared from 20 days from the date of signing, which would have been February
22nd, 2024. It also required that both attorneys were to approve it to form within 5 days (have 5 days to approve
the order), and that if no agreement on form was reached, a motion to sign would need to be filed within 30 days.
The report noted that the parties’ personal approval was not required for entry of the order, implying the attorneys’ sign-off
or a court motion would suffice. No district judge signed an order at that time – the associate judge’s report was
essentially a recommendation to be formalized in a written order.  
Immediately after the Feb 1 hearing, Respondent lost confidence in his attorney’s actions and fired his attorney.
Believing that the “agreement” did not reflect the child’s best interests or was entered under false pretenses (due to
Petitioner’s unfounded allegations), Respondent promptly withdrew his consent to the announced terms. On February
5, 2024, before any temporary order was signed by the court, Respondent (now pro se) filed an Emergency Motion to
Reconsider and Vacate Temporary Orders. This motion put the court on notice that Respondent no longer consented to
the supposed agreed terms and that he objected to any temporary order being entered as announced.  
Despite this, the reconsideration was denied and no findings were ever entered. In fact, the order explicitly ordered
Respondent to sign the orders to which he did not agree in violation of his own directives.
Texas law is clear that an associate judge’s report or proposed order is not a final, enforceable court order
unless and until it is adopted and signed by the referring court. Under the Family Code, an associate judge may
conduct hearings and recommend orders, but those recommendations remain subject to approval by the district court
judge. Section 201.011 of the Texas Family Code provides that an associate judge’s report “may contain the associate
judge’s findings, conclusions, or recommendations and may be in the form of a proposed order”. In other words, the
associate judge’s report (even if titled “Temporary Orders”) is essentially a draft or advisory decision; it does not itself
carry the force of a court order until the proper procedures are completed.  
Family Code § 201.013 unambiguously outlines how and when an associate judge’s proposal becomes an order of the
court. If a party timely requests a de novo hearing by the referring judge, the associate judge’s proposed order may be
enforced in the interim (except for certain matters) pending that hearing. However, if no timely request for a de novo
hearing is filed, the statute states that “the proposed order or judgment of the associate judge becomes the
order or judgment of the referring court only on the referring court’s signing the proposed order or judgment.”
Thus, absent a de novo appeal, an associate judge’s recommendation must be signed by the district judge to have any
legal effect. Until the judge signs it, it is merely a proposed order, not an actual court order.  
Because the February 1, 2024 temporary orders were never signed or adopted by the court, Respondent was (and is)
under no legal obligation to follow them, and neither party could properly enforce those terms through contempt or other
remedies. A party cannot be held in contempt for violating a non-existent court order. Here, the “Agreed Temporary
Orders” are, at most, an agreement between the parties that was not entered as a judgment. When Respondent withdrew
his agreement (as discussed below), even that contractual underpinning fell apart.  The Family Code’s requirements were
not met, and thus the purported temporary orders are void ab initio due to lack of rendition or entry by the referring
court.  
The stage is thus set for this Court to intervene, because as of now, there is no operative temporary order governing
the child’s conservatorship or possession.

Because the February 1, 2024 temporary orders were never properly entered as a court order (and would have been
invalid if entered without consent - which is clearly the case here), they are void and can be attacked in this proceeding.
Generally, once a court renders a final judgment, parties are constrained to challenge that judgment on direct appeal or in
the original case; collateral attacks on final judgments are disfavored. However, only a void judgment is subject to
collateral attack in a separate proceeding. Browning v. Prostok, 165 S.W.3d 336, 346 (Tex. 2005) (“Browning v.
Placke, 698 S.W.2d 362, 363 (Tex. 1985)”)
In this SAPCR, Respondent is effectively collaterally attacking the temporary orders from the divorce case by asserting
their invalidity. Such a collateral challenge is permissible here because those orders are void. As the Texas Supreme
Court has explained, “Only a void judgment may be collaterally attacked.” Id.
Accordingly, Respondent asks this Court to formally declare that the March 26, 2024 “Agreed Temporary Orders” (and
any interlocutory rulings associated with them) in Cause No. 322-744263-23 are void, of no effect, and not binding on
the parties. This declaration will remove any doubt or argument by Petitioner that those terms still govern the parties’
rights. It will also foreclose any attempt to enforce or rely on those non-orders (for example, in claims of violation or in
arguing res judicata). The Court has the authority in equity and under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (Tex. Civ.
Prac. & Rem. Code chapter 37) to declare the rights and status of the parties vis-à-vis that prior proceeding – particularly
given that the SAPCR directly concerns the child who was also at issue in the divorce temporary orders. Granting such
relief is appropriate to prevent confusion and multiplicative litigation. Once the prior “orders” are declared void, this Court
can proceed to issue fresh temporary orders for the child without any conflict or cloud from the divorce case.  
In sum, the prior temporary orders are a legal nullity and this Court should treat them as such. The Court’s order declaring
them void will simply recognize the reality that, due to the procedural faults and lack of consent, those orders never had
legal existence. This clarification is critical to move forward in protecting the child’s welfare, as discussed next.  
Immediate Emergency Relief Is Necessary to Protect the Child’s Best Interest 
Every day that passes without a valid temporary order is a day of potential harm or uncertainty for the child. The
current situation – a divorce case stuck in limbo with no operative orders, and parents in dispute – is untenable for a
child’s well-being. The child has effectively been living under an informal or contested arrangement since February 2024.
Petitioner has acted as though she has primary custody under the (void) temporary orders, while Respondent has been
sidelined and denied the normal possession or decision-making that a proper order (or a true agreement) would have
provided him. This dynamic, fueled by Petitioner’s unproven allegations of family violence, has caused significant stress
and instability for the child. Respondent fears that Petitioner is leveraging the appearance of an order to restrict his
contact with the child and to make unilateral decisions that are not in the child’s best interest. Meanwhile, the divorce
proceeding has not moved forward to a final resolution – over 12 months have elapsed since the March hearing, with no
trial setting in sight. This stalemate directly affects the child: there is no clear court-sanctioned framework for
conservatorship, visitation, or support, and your client has only introduced chaos into their lives.
This Court, now handling the SAPCR, has both the authority and the duty to step in and provide stability. Under Tex. Fam.
Code § 105.001, “the court may make a temporary order, including the modification of a prior temporary order, for
the safety and welfare of the child,” including orders for temporary conservatorship and possession.
The Family Code specifically empowers courts to act expeditiously to protect a child: if there is immediate danger to the
child’s physical or emotional health, the court can even issue temporary orders without notice (such as a temporary
restraining order) to address the emergency. Here, Respondent asserts that the child’s emotional welfare is indeed in
jeopardy. The lack of a valid order has enabled Petitioner to marginalize Respondent’s role in the child’s life, purportedly
under the guise of the void temporary orders. Petitioner’s false accusations of violence – never tested or proven in court –
have created a pretext for her to limit Respondent’s access. Consequently, the child is being unjustly deprived of time and
a relationship with Respondent, who has been a loving father with no history of abuse. This scenario is precisely what
emergency temporary orders are designed to prevent. The Court should not allow a procedural quagmire to result in a
child effectively losing a parent or receiving inferior care.  
Most importantly, the “best interest of the child” is the paramount consideration in any conservatorship or
possession decision. See 153.002 TEX. FAM. CODE.
All Texas courts must ensure that their orders first and foremost serve the child’s best interest. By that standard,
continuing under the shadow of void orders and parental discord is plainly not in this child’s best interest. Instead, the
child’s best interest calls for fresh, valid temporary orders that set forth clear, fair, and safe arrangements for custody and
visitation while the parents’ disputes are resolved. The Court should craft these orders based on current evidence and the
child’s needs – not based on an outdated and unconsented plan from February. The Family Code’s public policy (Tex.
Fam. Code § 153.001) favors frequent, continuing contact with fit parents and stable environments free of violence or
abuse. Here, Respondent is ready, willing, and able to care for the child and poses no danger, and he simply seeks a
normal custody schedule that allows the child to have both parents in his life. Petitioner’s unsupported claims of family

violence (made to gain a litigation advantage) should not dictate the child’s reality any longer, especially since those
claims have not been substantiated in any court hearing.  
Why your consolidation motion and response are insufficient, and will fail, or be
met with mandamus if granted (after reconsideration)
Normally, even without continuing exclusive jurisdiction, a prior pending suit would require the new suit to be consolidated
or abated (as discussed above with § 6.407 and dominant jurisdiction). The mother (divorce petitioner) could argue that
the original court “has jurisdiction” over the children by virtue of the pending divorce, so the SAPCR should not proceed
separately. However, the void nature of the prior temporary orders is a game-changer. If those orders are void, then
the original case has not effectively adjudicated anything regarding the children’s current custody or support. The SAPCR
petitioner can contend that because the prior orders are null, there is no valid existing order or active management of the
children’s case, and the new court is free to act in the children’s best interests. This is the EXACT argument made. In
effect, the argument is that the divorce case’s jurisdiction over the children lapsed into dormancy or “dormant jurisdiction”
due to your failure to prosecute the case.
It’s important to distinguish jurisdiction from orders. The continuing jurisdiction doctrine would typically prevent a
different court from issuing orders if a final order existed or if another court was actively handling the case. But here the
SAPCR is filed in the same county as the divorce. There is no risk of two different counties competing; it’s an internal
issue. The SAPCR effectively asks the court to take up a new cause number and to recognize that the old cause has
stalled and its orders are void.  
EVEN IF the void argument fails, there is another nuance to this area of law. Despite the lack of a final order, the
pending divorce still technically invokes the court’s jurisdiction over the children. Typically, the proper course is to revive or
dismiss the dormant divorce, rather than maintain a wholly separate SAPCR on the side. Texas courts adhere to the
principle that the first suit filed (here, the divorce) should dominate; a later-filed suit concerning the same subject (the
children) can be abated to prevent conflicting rulings. In fact, in In re Shifflet, for example, a party attempted parallel
litigation regarding child custody, and the court emphasized that modifications must be filed in the court with jurisdiction
over the original case
The only exception to the one-court rule is narrow. Texas law does allow a court to lose dominant jurisdiction if the
party with the first suit proceeded in bad faith or the suit is not actively pursued. Both apply here. The first suit was
unquestionably brought in bad faith, as the declaration of an active protective order being in effect against the
Respondent was an intentional fabrication designed to provide your client with an advantage. Despite this, the
Texas legislature should have prevented the first hearing from ever happening, because 6.405b of the Texas Family
Code required your client to present the alleged order to the court BEFORE ANY HEARING. 
CONCLUSION 
Thus, the SAPCR is appropriately before the court, and the only argument you made in your Response fails. The court
denied my attempt to open this separate suit, requiring me to file a 17 page argument as to why the case should be
accepted, and then it was.
So your response effectively mirrors the first denial from the court, which amounts to no response being filed at all.
It is clear you are not representing your client in a manner to uphold the law or the best interests of the children, but to

Gmail - Notice of Temporary EX-Parte TRO

4/12/25, 1:06 PM Gmail - Notice of Temporary EX-Parte TRO

violence (made to gain a litigation advantage) should not dictate the child’s reality any longer, especially since those
claims have not been substantiated in any court hearing.

Why your consolidation motion and response are insufficient, and will fail, or be
met with mandamus if granted (after reconsideration)

Normally, even without continuing exclusive jurisdiction, a prior pending suit would require the new suit to be consolidated
or abated (as discussed above with § 6.407 and dominant jurisdiction). The mother (divorce petitioner) could argue that
the original court “has jurisdiction” over the children by virtue of the pending divorce, so the SAPCR should not proceed
separately. However, the void nature of the prior temporary orders is a game-changer. If those orders are void, then
the original case has not effectively adjudicated anything regarding the children’s current custody or support. The SAPCR
petitioner can contend that because the prior orders are null, there is no valid existing order or active management of the
children’s case, and the new court is free to act in the children’s best interests. This is the EXACT argument made. In
effect, the argument is that the divorce case’s jurisdiction over the children lapsed into dormancy or “dormant jurisdiction”
due to your failure to prosecute the case.

It’s important to distinguish jurisdiction from orders. The continuing jurisdiction doctrine would typically prevent a
different court from issuing orders if a final order existed or if another court was actively handling the case. But here the
SAPCR is filed in the same county as the divorce. There is no risk of two different counties competing; it’s an internal
issue. The SAPCR effectively asks the court to take up a new cause number and to recognize that the old cause has
stalled and its orders are void.

EVEN IF the void argument fails, there is another nuance to this area of law. Despite the lack of a final order, the
pending divorce still technically invokes the court’s jurisdiction over the children. Typically, the proper course is to revive or
dismiss the dormant divorce, rather than maintain a wholly separate SAPCR on the side. Texas courts adhere to the
principle that the first suit filed (here, the divorce) should dominate; a later-filed suit concerning the same subject (the
children) can be abated to prevent conflicting rulings. In fact, in In re Shifflet, for example, a party attempted parallel
litigation regarding child custody, and the court emphasized that modifications must be filed in the court with jurisdiction
over the original case

The only exception to the one-court rule is narrow. Texas law does allow a court to lose dominant jurisdiction if the
party with the first suit proceeded in bad faith or the suit is not actively pursued. Both apply here. The first suit was
unquestionably brought in bad faith, as the declaration of an active protective order being in effect against the
Respondent was an intentional fabrication designed to provide your client with an advantage. Despite this, the

Texas legislature should have prevented the first hearing from ever happening, because 6.405b of the Texas Family
Code required your client to present the alleged order to the court BEFORE ANY HEARING.

CONCLUSION

Thus, the SAPCR is appropriately before the court, and the only argument you made in your Response fails. The court
denied my attempt to open this separate suit, requiring me to file a 17 page argument as to why the case should be
accepted, and then it was.

So your response effectively mirrors the first denial from the court, which amounts to no response being filed at all.
It is clear you are not representing your client in a manner to uphold the law or the best interests of the children, but to
only appear when needed to obstruct the much needed justice that the children need and deserve.

This is my position.

Hello, 
This is Charles Dustin Myers, Petitioner in the above captioned cause, and I received an automated reply deferring me to
this email when originally reaching out to the Honorable Coordinator.
The original email's purpose was to inform the Honorable Coordinator that I had just received notification through the EFM
that the emergency ex-parte TRO had been accepted by the court.
I am following up to inquire about the status of the request.
I thank you for your attention to this urgent matter, and I will wait for further directive from the court to proceed accordingly.
As mentioned in the motion, the Respondent in this matter and her counsel of record have been duly notified of the relief
being sought and the motion itself, but have not responded to any attempts to communicate regarding this urgent matter.
Thank you and have a wonderful evening.
Respectfully,
Charles Dustin Myers

Ms. Wierzbicki, Mr. Carter,
Thank you for the update. However, I must respectfully object to the assertion that this is a mandatory consolidation.
Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 174(a), consolidation is discretionary and not automatic where doing so would cause
delay, injustice, or prejudice to a party. Additionally, the Texas Supreme Court in Curtis v. Gibbs, 511 S.W.2d 263 (Tex.
1974) expressly carved out exceptions to dominant jurisdiction where:
The original case was filed in bad faith,
The case isn't been prosecuted;
Equity and justice require an independent forum.
All three conditions are present here. The SAPCR was filed in good faith after the 322nd case became procedurally
stalled and legally defective—with no Notice of Remand, no evidentiary rulings on the children, and pending dispositive
motions including unopposed requests for dismissal. 
It would be prejudicial to the children to consolidate a case that had no ability to proceed.
Thank you.
Respectfully,
Charles Dustin Myers
Pro Se Petitioner

stalled and legally defective—with no Notice of Remand, no evidentiary rulings on the children, and pending dispositive
motions including unopposed requests for dismissal.
It would be prejudicial to the children to consolidate a case that had no ability to proceed.
Thank you.
Respectfully,
Charles Dustin Myers

Pro Se Petitioner

Friends on other side,
The Emergency EX-PARTE TRO has been filed and accepted by the court and is awaiting the judge's review. 
If a hearing is required, I will CC Cooper in the email correspondence.
If a hearing is not required, I will serve each of you with a copy of the TRO and proposed order in accordance with the
rules no later than seven days prior to the hearing.
The TRO has the following provisions:
* Respondent is PROHIBITED from preventing Petitioner from entering the matrimonial residence located at 6641
Anne Ct, Watauga, TX 76148.
* Respondent is PROHIBITED from disturbing the peace of the minor children named in this suit.
* Petitioner and Respondent are PROHIBITED from acting without candor towards all members of the household
in the presence of the children.
* Respondent is PROHIBITED from bringing the children in the presence of DAMEN GAULT KAZLAUSKAS.
* Respondent is PROHIBITED from taking the children outside of Tarrant County, Texas.
These provisions, if granted, will be in effect until a full hearing is held no later than 14 days after the order is signed by
the judge.
Once the notice of hearing is served on all parties, I will be filing a motion for pre-trial conference to discuss the Rule 12
motion filed and served last week to ensure those issues are resolved prior to trial. 
At the hearing, the relief I am seeking is to convert the provisions from the TRO into temporary injunctions which will be
the exact same but will ask for them to remain until further order of the court and reset the status quo to March 6, 2024,
which was the last peaceful time enjoyed by all parties prior to the Respondent's unlawful lockout.
If a continuance is needed in order to get your affairs in order for the Rule 12 conference, please reach out as I have no
problem signing an agreed continuance if more time is needed.
I am not seeking sanctions at this time.
If granted, I believe the preceding details suit the best interests of Mara and Caroline, preserves their emotional and
financial well-being, allows myself to repair the substantial damage caused from the prior thirteen months, promotes an
amicable co-parenting relationship, and most importantly upholds Texas Law in ensuring that children have continuous,
frequent access to both parents and that parents are encouraged to work together during and after divorce because
doing so is in their best interests.
I'm not looking to punish, hurt, or ruin anyone. I'm simply looking to do what's best for the kids and start working together
to finish this so we can all move on with our lives.
If you have any suggestions, modifications, or alternative solutions, please feel free to reach out and let me know, or
schedule a time and place to meet in person that best meets your schedule.
Respectfully,

Good Evening,
I have received communication from opposing party who is pro se that he will be walking through an Emergency TRO.
Our office has a hearing scheduled for tomorrow morning in Parker County and is unable to attend. However, I will be
available by cell phone regarding this matter if the Judge would like to speak to me regarding the Emergency TRO.
Please contact our office to patch me in for any calls that Judge would like to have.
Additionally, this case already is pending in the 322nd for a divorce proceeding regarding property and children matters.
We will be consolidating the case and walking it through the 322nd for signature next week.

Court staff,
Ms. Carter’s recent correspondence is improper for several reasons, and appears to be an attempt to delay or interfere
with proceedings in which she has otherwise failed to meaningfully participate in. The following reasons support this
statement:
1. An objection to consolidation is already on file and remains unopposed. It cites controlling Texas precedent. Any
suggestion that consolidation is agreed upon or inevitable is misleading. Instead, she should properly file with the court
why the consolidation is improper or at the very least argue against Petitioner's position.
2. Ms. Carter has not fulfilled her obligation under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 237a to file a Notice of Remand. Until
she does, she is prohibited from proceeding or filing anything in the 322nd District Court as they currently do not have
jurisdiction over this matter until this obligation is fulfilled.
3. Her authority to represent the Respondent remains under challenge pursuant to a Rule 12 motion filed September 20,
2024. No hearing has been held, no written statement of authority has been filed, and no ruling has been made. Until
resolved, Rule 12 bars her from participating in either proceeding.
4. Ms. Carter has not prosecuted the case in the 322nd District Court in over eight months. This inaction has prejudiced
the Petitioner and delayed resolution of urgent matters affecting the children.
5. She has failed to file any objections, responsive pleadings, or legal arguments opposing the relief requested—including
the Emergency TRO now pending.
6. Rather than reaching out to Petitioner to resolve any scheduling conflict, Ms. Carter improperly attempted to influence
the court by email. This violates the spirit of cooperation required by the rules, particularly where her participation is
procedurally barred.
7. Ms. Carter’s conduct appears designed to delay relief and subvert the best interest of the children, despite her failure to
oppose the requested relief in any meaningful way.
8. She has been provided with full notice of the Emergency TRO, the proposed order, supporting exhibits, and the time
and location of presentment. She has no legal basis to subvert Petitioner's due process rights.
In summary, Ms. Carter has not provided anything of substance in either Court, has not prosecuted the case, has not
argued on behalf of her client, or followed proper procedure.
Simply labeling the opposition as pro se and claiming that the consolidation will be filed without disclosing the above facts
is dishonest and should not be permitted as it will only cause further unnecessary delays to the relief being sought without
any substance being provided.
Again, all of these points have been argued in both courts, and it is her duty as counsel to handle these matters in
accordance with Texas Law.
These matters should be handled between the parties - not attempt to influence court staff after hours.
The reason we are here in the first place is due to the above unanswered facts. Ms. Carter has had ample time to file an
objection, response, or counter argument, but has chosen not to do so.
It would've been far more appropriate for Ms. Carter to have reached out to me directly to discuss scheduling conflicts.
Prior to the latest email, there was no indication Ms. Carter intended to participate at all despite being provided with all
relevant materials.

to Petitioner and the children.

Pro se litigants are expected to follow the rules of procedure to the same extent licensed attorneys are.
This email chain should be disregarded in its entirety.

Have a good evening.

Court staff,

Ms. Carter’s recent correspondence is improper for several reasons, and appears to be an attempt to delay or interfere
with proceedings in which she has otherwise failed to meaningfully participate in. The following reasons support this
statement:

1. An objection to consolidation is already on file and remains unopposed. It cites controlling Texas precedent. Any
suggestion that consolidation is agreed upon or inevitable is misleading. Instead, she should properly file with the court
why the consolidation is improper or at the very least argue against Petitioner's position.

2. Ms. Carter has not fulfilled her obligation under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 237a to file a Notice of Remand. Until
she does, she is prohibited from proceeding or filing anything in the 322nd District Court as they currently do not have
jurisdiction over this matter until this obligation is fulfilled.

3. Her authority to represent the Respondent remains under challenge pursuant to a Rule 12 motion filed September 20,
2024. No hearing has been held, no written statement of authority has been filed, and no ruling has been made. Until
resolved, Rule 12 bars her from participating in either proceeding.

4. Ms. Carter has not prosecuted the case in the 322nd District Court in over eight months. This inaction has prejudiced
the Petitioner and delayed resolution of urgent matters affecting the children.

5. She has failed to file any objections, responsive pleadings, or legal arguments opposing the relief requested—including
the Emergency TRO now pending.

6. Rather than reaching out to Petitioner to resolve any scheduling conflict, Ms. Carter improperly attempted to influence
the court by email. This violates the spirit of cooperation required by the rules, particularly where her participation is
procedurally barred.

7. Ms. Carter’s conduct appears designed to delay relief and subvert the best interest of the children, despite her failure to
oppose the requested relief in any meaningful way.

8. She has been provided with full notice of the Emergency TRO, the proposed order, supporting exhibits, and the time
and location of presentment. She has no legal basis to subvert Petitioner's due process rights.

In summary, Ms. Carter has not provided anything of substance in either Court, has not prosecuted the case, has not
argued on behalf of her client, or followed proper procedure.

Simply labeling the opposition as pro se and claiming that the consolidation will be filed without disclosing the above facts
is dishonest and should not be permitted as it will only cause further unnecessary delays to the relief being sought without
any substance being provided.

Again, all of these points have been argued in both courts, and it is her duty as counsel to handle these matters in
accordance with Texas Law.
These matters should be handled between the parties - not attempt to influence court staff after hours.
The reason we are here in the first place is due to the above unanswered facts. Ms. Carter has had ample time to file an
objection, response, or counter argument, but has chosen not to do so.
It would've been far more appropriate for Ms. Carter to have reached out to me directly to discuss scheduling conflicts.
Prior to the latest email, there was no indication Ms. Carter intended to participate at all despite being provided with all
relevant materials.
The court should disregard this email correspondence in its entirety for the reasons stated herein as it is highly prejudicial
to Petitioner and the children.

Good morning,
Mr. Myers appeared before me to schedule the hearing for the TRO; my apologies I did not realize this was that
same case.  We can go ahead and set the TRO with us, but most likely the case will be transferred prior to the
hearing date and the case needs to be transferred prior to that date.
Mr. Myers will be emailing with dates available for the hearing.

Cooper,
I've already objected.
You have no legal authority to do so until you address my objection filed and served to you.
Furthermore, you have not sent the Notice required by rule 237a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and have not
shown you authority to represent the Petitioner in this matter.
Finally, you claimed to have been retained in your individual capacity yet are claiming Marx Altman and Johnson is filing
pleadings on your behalf, and Roderick D. Marx is not a party in this suit nor has he made a formal appearance.
You're well aware of these obligations, and any order resulting from this motion will be challenged via the proper legal
proceedings.
You cannot continue to disregard the rules of procedure, fail to respond to motions or evidence served to you, and
continue to expect favors from the bench in leu of you performing your duties as a licensed attorneys.
You are put on notice that if any such motion is presented to the court in the face of the above facts or the unanswered
objection already served to you, I will move for your disqualification immediately and will provide the Texas OAG with your
information and detailed misconduct as well as the State Bar of Texas.
Further, you have not provided or served a copy of the proposed order which you intend to present, which is required.
This conversation will be filed and made apart of the official court record. 
Respectfully submitted,
