Ms. Carter,
Pursuant to Tarrant County Local Rule 3.30(c)  , this letter provides notice that I intend to present an Emergency Ex
Parte Application for Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) seeking immediate relief in the interest of my children’s well-
being and to prevent irreparable harm to my property, family relationships, and ability to earn a living.
The TRO will NOT request exclusive temporary use of the marital residence but that if your client has issue, she has
alternative housing and has used possession of the residence to damage my livelihood and restrict my parenting time.
The application will include verified evidence supporting the necessity of immediate relief, including:
Verified communications acknowledging my need for the home to work
Records of financial losses from displacement (Airbnb receipts, business losses, etc.)
Evidence of your client disposing of or concealing my personal property
Proof that the children have been left unsupervised overnight by your client on multiple occasions.
Documentation from the school showing excessive absences and academic concerns regarding Mara.
Text evidence between myself and the multiple AIRBNB hosts showcasing the difficulty faced in setting up
operations outside of the reliable setup of the house.
Photographs and texts contradicting claims made in previous pleadings
Dental neglect of my youngest daughter (photos of untreated cavities)
Financial documents showing I paid all vehicle and rent obligations, contrary to your client’s claims
Text messages between myself and the grandparents of your client showing we can be amicable during this
situation and put the children first.
Photo evidence showing the only way I have to communicate with my daughters is via an online game, ROBLOX,
due to your client preventing communications.
My criminal record showing that I have never been convicted of a violent crime.
The current temporary orders which are facially void and can be collaterally attacked in any court at any time.
Again, there is absolutely zero reason to have me barred from the residence and strip the children of their parents. It
contradicts the lodestone of the Family Code which is in the best interests of the children. 
This is the more logical solution. If we pursued this route in the beginning, we'd already be divorced and the children's
financial stability wouldn't have been sacrificed. There is no risk of danger. There is no risk of harm to the children. There
is only the possibility of recovery. That is in their best interests.
There is no legal reason your client has to want me out of the house other than just that. She cannot unilaterally decide
that I agree to everything and then do as she pleases with my personal belongings and neglect the children in multiple
areas.
Your argument that I agreed to the orders in place falls flat on its face for many reasons which will not be repeated here.
I am providing this notice strictly to comply with Local Rule 11(e). I will proceed to present the application to the Court
without further delay due to the nature of the harm and urgency involved.
If you wish to discuss these matters, I'm happy to do so - otherwise I will inform the court that you do not agree to the
orders upon submission.
This situation cannot continue, and the alternatives that are available must be pursued to uphold the best interests of the
children before any further damage to their well-being is sustained.
Respectfully,
Charles Dustin Myers

Cooper,
Petitioner (your client) filed the original divorce petition in December 2023 in the 322nd District Court (Cause No. 322-
744263-23). In that petition, she alleged false claims of family violence and sought a waiver of the 60-day waiting
period for divorce, ostensibly to expedite temporary relief by labeling me as an abuser and claiming she had an active
order of protection against me at the time of filing. 
On February 1, 2024, a temporary orders hearing was held before an Associate Judge. The parties (through counsel)
announced an apparent agreement on temporary custody and other matters. The associate judge signed an “Associate
Judge’s Report for Temporary Orders”, titled as “Agreed Temporary Orders.” Importantly, this report did not itself
constitute a signed court order; instead, it outlined the agreed terms and directed further action before any order would
be final. Specifically, the report stated that Respondent's attorney (Dan Bacalis) would prepare a formal temporary
orders document, which would be prepared from 20 days from the date of signing, which would have been February
22nd, 2024. It also required that both attorneys were to approve it to form within 5 days (have 5 days to approve
the order), and that if no agreement on form was reached, a motion to sign would need to be filed within 30 days.
The report noted that the parties’ personal approval was not required for entry of the order, implying the attorneys’ sign-off
or a court motion would suffice. No district judge signed an order at that time – the associate judge’s report was
essentially a recommendation to be formalized in a written order.  
Immediately after the Feb 1 hearing, Respondent lost confidence in his attorney’s actions and fired his attorney.
Believing that the “agreement” did not reflect the child’s best interests or was entered under false pretenses (due to
Petitioner’s unfounded allegations), Respondent promptly withdrew his consent to the announced terms. On February
5, 2024, before any temporary order was signed by the court, Respondent (now pro se) filed an Emergency Motion to
Reconsider and Vacate Temporary Orders. This motion put the court on notice that Respondent no longer consented to
the supposed agreed terms and that he objected to any temporary order being entered as announced.  
Despite this, the reconsideration was denied and no findings were ever entered. In fact, the order explicitly ordered
Respondent to sign the orders to which he did not agree in violation of his own directives.
Texas law is clear that an associate judge’s report or proposed order is not a final, enforceable court order
unless and until it is adopted and signed by the referring court. Under the Family Code, an associate judge may
conduct hearings and recommend orders, but those recommendations remain subject to approval by the district court
judge. Section 201.011 of the Texas Family Code provides that an associate judge’s report “may contain the associate
judge’s findings, conclusions, or recommendations and may be in the form of a proposed order”. In other words, the
associate judge’s report (even if titled “Temporary Orders”) is essentially a draft or advisory decision; it does not itself
carry the force of a court order until the proper procedures are completed.  
Family Code § 201.013 unambiguously outlines how and when an associate judge’s proposal becomes an order of the
court. If a party timely requests a de novo hearing by the referring judge, the associate judge’s proposed order may be
enforced in the interim (except for certain matters) pending that hearing. However, if no timely request for a de novo
hearing is filed, the statute states that “the proposed order or judgment of the associate judge becomes the
order or judgment of the referring court only on the referring court’s signing the proposed order or judgment.”
Thus, absent a de novo appeal, an associate judge’s recommendation must be signed by the district judge to have any
legal effect. Until the judge signs it, it is merely a proposed order, not an actual court order.  
Because the February 1, 2024 temporary orders were never signed or adopted by the court, Respondent was (and is)
under no legal obligation to follow them, and neither party could properly enforce those terms through contempt or other
remedies. A party cannot be held in contempt for violating a non-existent court order. Here, the “Agreed Temporary
Orders” are, at most, an agreement between the parties that was not entered as a judgment. When Respondent withdrew
his agreement (as discussed below), even that contractual underpinning fell apart.  The Family Code’s requirements were
not met, and thus the purported temporary orders are void ab initio due to lack of rendition or entry by the referring
court.  
The stage is thus set for this Court to intervene, because as of now, there is no operative temporary order governing
the child’s conservatorship or possession.
