The respondent respectfully objects to the motion for the 
forthcoming reasons: 
I.
ARGUMENT
A. Pending Mandamus in the Second Court of Appeals.4
On April 8th, 2024, Relator filed with the Second Court of Appeals 
a Petition for Writ of Mandamus, which was denied with a general denial 
on April 10th, 2024. 
The Second Court of Appeals is currently deliberating on a Motion 
for Rehearing concerning a Petition for Writ of Mandamus filed by the 
Respondent on April 18th, 2024, that corrected procedural defects in 
the initial petition. 
The appellate court's forthcoming decision could significantly alter 
the legal landscape of the underlying issues in this case. Proceeding 
with a pre-trial hearing while the appeal is unresolved may result in 
redundant judicial efforts and conflicting judicial directives. 
B. Failure to Conduct Pre-Motion Conference.
Pursuant to Local Court Rules of Tarrant County, no court proceeding may be 
set by any attorney or self-represented litigant who fails to comply with Id at
