ISSUES PRESENTED FOR RECONSIDERATION 
 
Rehearing Issue No. 1: 
The Texas Supreme Court has held that consolidation constitutes an abuse of 
discretion when it prejudices a party or misjudges the relatedness of actions. 
The panel erred by denying mandamus relief and allowing to stand a sua 
sponte consolidation order that prejudiced Relator by delaying urgent child 
custody proceedings, eliminating strategic advantages, pre-empted appellate 
review, generated further procedural confusion. 
 
 
Rehearing Issue No. 2: 
When the record demonstrates that separate proceedings are necessary to 
prevent manifest injustice, the trial court has a duty to avoid consolidation. 
The panel erred by overlooking the manifest injustice resulting from the trial 
court’s sua sponte consolidation, which violated due process by ignoring a 
pending Rule 12 motion and written objection, and introduced further 
procedural irregularities into already strained litigation.

TO THE HONORABLE SECOND COURT OF APPEALS: 
Relator CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS respectfully moves this Honorable 
Court for en banc reconsideration of the panel decisions rendered in three separate 
but interwoven mandamus proceedings to be presented for reconsideration in the 
following order: 
i. Cause No. 02-25-00166-CV (denied April 14, 2025) (“Void Order”) 
ii. Cause No. 02-25-00171-CV (denied April 17, 2025) (“Consolidation”) 
iii. Cause No. 02-25-00164-CV (denied April 11, 2025) (“SAPCR/TRO”) 
 
This motion serves as the second filed reconsideration motion and addresses 
the panel’s denial of Cause No. 02-25-00171-CV (attached as Tab 1), referred to as 
the “Consolidation” mandamus.   
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT  
This motion satisfies the stringent standards for en banc reconsideration 
under Tex. R. App. P. 41.2(c) because the panel’s denial conflicts with controlling 
precedent and overlooks critical facts in the mandamus record. The trial court 
abused its discretion by sua sponte consolidating Relator’s SAPCR with a stalled 
divorce case on April 11, 2025, without notice, hearing, or consideration of 
Relator’s objection and pending Rule 12 motion. This consolidation prejudiced 
Relator by delaying urgent child custody and support resolutions, eliminating 
strategic advantages, pre-empted appellate review, and caused further procedural 
confusion, violating Tex. R. Civ. P. 174(a) and Tex. Fam. Code § 153 .002. The

TO THE HONORABLE SECOND COURT OF APPEALS:

Relator CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS respectfully moves this Honorable
Court for en banc reconsideration of the panel decisions rendered in three separate
but interwoven mandamus proceedings to be presented for reconsideration in the
following order:

i. Cause No. 02-25-00166-CV (denied April 14, 2025) (“Void Order’)
ii. Cause No. 02-25-00171-CV (denied April 17, 2025) (“Consolidation”)
iii. Cause No. 02-25-00164-CV (denied April 11, 2025) (““SAPCR/TRO”)

This motion serves as the second filed reconsideration motion and addresses
the panel’s denial of Cause No. 02-25-00171-CV (attached as Tab 1), referred to as
the “Consolidation” mandamus.

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

This motion satisfies the stringent standards for en banc reconsideration
under Tex. R. App. P. 41.2(c) because the panel’s denial conflicts with controlling
precedent and overlooks critical facts in the mandamus record. The trial court
abused its discretion by sua sponte consolidating Relator’s SAPCR with a stalled
divorce case on April 11, 2025, without notice, hearing, or consideration of
Relator’s objection and pending Rule 12 motion. This consolidation prejudiced
Relator by delaying urgent child custody and support resolutions, eliminating
strategic advantages, pre-empted appellate review, and caused further procedural

confusion, violating Tex. R. Civ. P. 174(a) and Tex. Fam. Code § 153 .002. The

panel’s denial conflicts with Womack v. Berry, 291 S.W.2d 677 (Tex. 1956), Dal-
Briar Corp. v. Baskette, 833 S.W.2d 612 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1992), and Lone Star 
Ford, Inc. v. McCormick, 838 S.W.2d 734 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1992), 
which emphasize that consolidation must not prejudice a party. En banc review is 
essential to ensure uniformity in family law and protect the children’s best 
interests. 
ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITY 
I. 
En banc reconsideration is warranted under Rule 41.2(c) due to 
extraordinary circumstances and the need for uniformity. 
 
En banc reconsideration is appropriate when a panel’s decision conflicts 
with controlling authority or involves an issue of exceptional importance. Tex. R. 
App. P. 41.2(c); In re Marriage of Harrison, 507 S.W.3d 259, 260 (Tex. App.—
[14th Dist.] April 26, 2016, order) as corrected May 10, 2016 (Frost, J., dissenting 
to partial grant of en banc reconsideration). This matter meets both criteria. 
The panel’s per curiam denial on April 17, 2025, conflicts with Texas 
Supreme Court precedent requiring trial courts to exercise discretion within 
guiding rules and principles. Womack v. Berry, 291 S.W.2d 677, 683 (Tex. 1956) 
(mandamus appropriate to correct clear abuse of discretion in trial management). 
The consolidation delays critical child custody and support determinations, 
undermining Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002, which mandates that “the best interest of

the child shall always be the primary consideration of the court in determining the 
issues of conservatorship and possession of and access to the child”. Allowing trial 
courts to consolidate cases sua sponte without addressing objections or pending 
motions sets a dangerous precedent in family law, where procedural fairness is 
paramount. En banc review is necessary to maintain uniformity and protect the 
children’s welfare. 
II. 
The panel’s denial conflicts with controlling authority and overlooks 
critical facts established in the mandamus record. 
The panel’s denial fails to recognize the trial court’s abuse of discretion and 
the resulting prejudice, as evidenced by the mandamus record and established 
Texas law. 
A. The trial court abused its discretion by consolidating without sound legal 
basis. 
 
Tex. R. Civ. P. 174(a) permits consolidation only when cases share common 
questions of law or fact and when it does not prejudice any party. The trial court’s 
sua sponte consolidation of Relator’s SAPCR with an unprosecuted divorce case 
lacks a sound legal basis and contravenes this rule. In Dal-Briar Corp. v. Baskette, 
833 S.W.2d 612, 615 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1992, no writ), the court held that 
consolidation constitutes an abuse of discretion if it prejudices a party, such as by

consolidation delays time-sensitive child custody and support decisions, directly 
undermining Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002. For example, the SAPCR’s unresolved 
custody issues, critical to the children’s stability, are stalled by the divorce case’s 
procedural complexities, causing ongoing harm to their welfare.  
Furthermore, in Lone Star Ford, Inc. v. McCormick, 838 S.W.2d 734, 737 
(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1992, writ denied), the court affirmed that while 
trial courts have broad discretion to consolidate cases with common issues, such 
discretion is abused if consolidation results in prejudice to a party. In that case, the 
court found no abuse because the appellant failed to demonstrate prejudice, noting, 
“Appellant failed to demonstrate how it was prejudiced as a result of 
consolidation.” Id. at 738.  In contrast, here, the consolidation has caused 
significant prejudice by delaying urgent child custody and support resolutions, 
which are time-sensitive and critical to the children’s welfare under Tex. Fam. 
Code § 153.002. This delay distinguishes the present case from Lone Star Ford and 
underscores the trial court’s abuse of discretion, as the issues still remain 
unadjudicated. 
Moreover, Womack v. Berry, 291 S.W.2d at 683, establishes that mandamus 
relief is appropriate when a trial court abuses its discretion to a party’s detriment, 
such as through improper trial management. Although Womack addressed separate 
trials, its principle applies analogously to consolidation decisions that prejudice a

party. The trial court’s failure to demonstrate common questions justifying 
consolidation, coupled with its disregard for the prejudice caused by delay, 
constitutes a clear abuse of discretion. See also Guar. Fed. Sav. Bank v. Horseshoe 
Operating Co., 793 S.W.2d 652, 658 (Tex. 1990) (trial court discretion in 
consolidation is not unbounded). The panel’s denial overlooks these precedents, 
allowing an unsupported consolidation to stand. 
B. The sua sponte consolidation resulted in prejudice and violated due 
process. 
The trial court’s consolidation order, issued without notice or hearing, 
violated Relator’s due process rights by ignoring a pending Tex. R. Civ. P. 12 
motion challenging the Real Party’s counsel’s authority and Relator’s objection to 
consolidation. (MR 7, MR 9) In Crestway Care Center, Inc. v. Berchelmann, 945 
S.W.2d 872, 873 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1997, orig. proceeding), the court 
emphasized that significant procedural actions, like consolidation, require clarity 
and proper documentation to ensure fair review. Here, the trial court’s failure to 
provide notice or a hearing—despite Relator’s objection (MR 9.1, MR 12.32) and 
pending Rule 12 motion (MR 7)—created procedural irregularities.  Moreover, 
Tex. R. Civ. P. 12 requires an attorney to demonstrate authority when challenged, 
and the trial court’s failure to resolve this motion risks validating actions by 
potentially unauthorized counsel, creating a procedural quagmire.

This consolidation action prejudiced Relator in four critical ways: (1) 
delaying urgent child custody and support resolutions that remain unopposed, 
causing further harm to the children’s welfare; (2) eliminating strategic advantages 
in the SAPCR court; (3) causing procedural confusion by merging distinct legal 
issues; and (4) thwarted Relator’s attempt at seeking mandamus relief. These

This consolidation action prejudiced Relator in four critical ways: (1)
delaying urgent child custody and support resolutions that remain unopposed,
causing further harm to the children’s welfare; (2) eliminating strategic advantages
in the SAPCR court; (3) causing procedural confusion by merging distinct legal
issues; and (4) thwarted Relator’s attempt at seeking mandamus relief. These
impacts mirror the prejudice in Dal-Briar Corp. v. Baskette, where consolidation
harmed a party’s ability to pursue timely relief. The Real Party’s counsel’s failure
to respond to this appeal further underscores the procedural irregularities. By
upholding the trial court’s order, the panel’s denial conflicts with these authorities
and fails to address the manifest injustice inflicted on Relator and the affected

CONCLUSION AND PRAYER 
The trial court’s sua sponte consolidation order of April 11, 2025, is not 
merely erroneous—it is procedurally indefensible. By consolidating Relator’s 
SAPCR with a stalled divorce case without notice, hearing, or resolution of a 
pending Rule 12 motion and objection, the court flouted due process and Texas 
Family Code § 153.002’s mandate to prioritize children’s best interests. The 
pending Rule 12 motion challenged the Real Party’s counsel’s authority, yet the 
court and Real Party proceeded as if no question existed, risking the validity of 
every subsequent action. This illogic is akin to building a house on a contested 
foundation, inviting collapse.   
Relator prays that this Court grant en banc reconsideration, withdraw or 
otherwise vacate the panel’s denial, and issue mandamus relief compelling the 
Respondent to vacate the consolidation order. Such relief will restore procedural 
fairness, protect constitutional rights, and ensure the children’s best interests are 
not sacrificed to judicial expediency. 
Respectfully submitted,
