Notice of Temporary EX-Parte TRO

To: Cooper Carter <coopercarter@majadmin.com>
Ms. Carter,
Pursuant to Tarrant County Local Rule 3.30(c)  , this letter provides notice that I intend to present an Emergency Ex
Parte Application for Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) seeking immediate relief in the interest of my children’s well-
being and to prevent irreparable harm to my property, family relationships, and ability to earn a living.
The TRO will NOT request exclusive temporary use of the marital residence but that if your client has issue, she has
alternative housing and has used possession of the residence to damage my livelihood and restrict my parenting time.
The application will include verified evidence supporting the necessity of immediate relief, including:
Verified communications acknowledging my need for the home to work
Records of financial losses from displacement (Airbnb receipts, business losses, etc.)
Evidence of your client disposing of or concealing my personal property
Proof that the children have been left unsupervised overnight by your client on multiple occasions.
Documentation from the school showing excessive absences and academic concerns regarding Mara.
Text evidence between myself and the multiple AIRBNB hosts showcasing the difficulty faced in setting up
operations outside of the reliable setup of the house.
Photographs and texts contradicting claims made in previous pleadings
Dental neglect of my youngest daughter (photos of untreated cavities)
Financial documents showing I paid all vehicle and rent obligations, contrary to your client’s claims
Text messages between myself and the grandparents of your client showing we can be amicable during this
situation and put the children first.
Photo evidence showing the only way I have to communicate with my daughters is via an online game, ROBLOX,
due to your client preventing communications.
My criminal record showing that I have never been convicted of a violent crime.
The current temporary orders which are facially void and can be collaterally attacked in any court at any time.
Again, there is absolutely zero reason to have me barred from the residence and strip the children of their parents. It
contradicts the lodestone of the Family Code which is in the best interests of the children. 
This is the more logical solution. If we pursued this route in the beginning, we'd already be divorced and the children's
financial stability wouldn't have been sacrificed. There is no risk of danger. There is no risk of harm to the children. There
is only the possibility of recovery. That is in their best interests.
There is no legal reason your client has to want me out of the house other than just that. She cannot unilaterally decide
that I agree to everything and then do as she pleases with my personal belongings and neglect the children in multiple
areas.
Your argument that I agreed to the orders in place falls flat on its face for many reasons which will not be repeated here.
I am providing this notice strictly to comply with Local Rule 11(e). I will proceed to present the application to the Court
without further delay due to the nature of the harm and urgency involved.
If you wish to discuss these matters, I'm happy to do so - otherwise I will inform the court that you do not agree to the
orders upon submission.
This situation cannot continue, and the alternatives that are available must be pursued to uphold the best interests of the
children before any further damage to their well-being is sustained.
Respectfully,
Charles Dustin Myers
