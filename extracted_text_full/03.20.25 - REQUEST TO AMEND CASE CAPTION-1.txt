NO. 233-765358-25 
 
IN THE 233RD DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
 
 
TO THE HONORABLE CLERK OF THE 233RD DISTRICT COURT: 
Petitioner, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, first respectfully submits this request to amend 
case caption in cause number 233-765358-25, the instant case. Petitioner incorrectly initiated the 
suit as next friend to M.E.M. and C.R.M. when the Texas Family Code § 151.001(a)(7) expressly 
authorizes the “right to represent the child[ren] in legal action and to make other decisions of 
substantial legal significance concerning the child[ren].” Therefore, Petitioner respectfully 
requests the caption of cause number 233-765358-25 read as follows: 
IN THE INTEREST OF M.E.M. AND C.R.M., CHILDREN 
CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, PETITIONER 
v. 
MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS, RESPONDENT 
 
 
Petitioner thanks the court for their attention to this matter, and prays that this Request to 
Amend Case Caption be granted and that the case caption be amended as set forth above.
