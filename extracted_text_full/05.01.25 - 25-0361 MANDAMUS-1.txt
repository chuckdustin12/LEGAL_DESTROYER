STATEMENT OF FACTS 
 
In this case Relator Charles D. Myers signed an “Agreed Associate Judge’s 
Report” on February 1, 2024, under prior counsel (MR 8), then promptly 
discharged his lawyer (MR 5). On February 8, 2024, the report was entered by the 
clerk, and the Relator revoked consent on February 9 by filing an emergency 
motion (styled to vacate) within three working days of notice. (MR 12) That filing 
served as a de novo hearing request under Tex. Fam. Code §201.015. On March 14 
an associate judge (Hon. Kaitcer) held the hearing – although under §201.015 the 
referring district judge should have conducted it – and denied Relator’s motion. 
The associate judge then ordered Relator to sign the previously agreed terms. (APP 
1.1) On March 26 the court issued “Temporary Orders” reciting that “all parties 
have agreed to the terms… as evidenced by the signatures below,” even though 
Relator had not signed and in fact had disavowed consent. (APP 2.1) The elected 
district judge never signed or adopted those orders under Tex. Fam. Code 
§201.013. The orders have been in effect since March 14, 2024, and no opposition 
to the relief being sought has been filed. 
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

timely review was requested. Both statutory law and case law require mutual

consent of all parties at the time the agreed order is rendered, with the only 
exception being certain mediated settlement agreements that have been properly 
executed by all parties, which does not apply to this case. Here, a Father was 
removed from his home based on false allegations of family violence and then was 
later ordered to agree to a settlement leveraged by the Real Party in Interest. These 
actions defy the very principles of justice, and have left the Relator without a stable 
home, left him unable to work, and has significantly disrupted the status quo and 
the relationship between with his two minor children named in this suit. The orders 
should be declared void ab initio and vacated through mandamus. 
ARGUMENT 
A. Standard of review 
For mandamus relief, a relator must establish that an order is void or a clear 
abuse of discretion with no adequate remedy by appeal. In re Nationwide 
Ins. Co. of Am., 494 S.W.3d 708, 712 (Tex. 2016) (orig. proceeding). A void order 
is an abuse of discretion, and mandamus will issue to remedy it regardless of 
whether the relator has an adequate remedy by appeal. In re Sw. Bell Tel. Co., 35 
S.W.3d 602, 605 (Tex. 2000) (orig. proceeding) Here, the Relator contends the 
orders are indeed void because the Associate Judge had no authority to render the 
orders in question, and they were never properly adopted by the referring court 
under the Texas Family Code.

A. Standard of review

For mandamus relief, a relator must establish that an order is void or a clear
abuse of discretion with no adequate remedy by appeal. In re Nationwide
Ins. Co. of Am., 494 S.W.3d 708, 712 (Tex. 2016) (orig. proceeding). A void order
is an abuse of discretion, and mandamus will issue to remedy it regardless of
whether the relator has an adequate remedy by appeal. Jn re Sw. Bell Tel. Co., 35
S.W.3d 602, 605 (Tex. 2000) (orig. proceeding) Here, the Relator contends the
orders are indeed void because the Associate Judge had no authority to render the
orders in question, and they were never properly adopted by the referring court

under the Texas Family Code.

B. The associate judge had no authority to enter the challenged orders without 
a written agreement or unrevoked waiver. 
 
Texas law limits the acts an associate judge may perform and the orders he 
may sign. Section 201.007 of the Family Code enumerates those powers. An 
associate judge may recommend an order to the referring court, but he may render 
and sign a final order only under narrow circumstances. Specifically, § 
201.007(a)(14) permits an associate judge to sign a final order only if all parties 
have agreed in writing or a party is in default, or if a party has waived notice or 
appearance at the final hearing. Subsection (a)(16) permits a final order if the 
parties sign a written waiver of a de novo hearing before the hearing begins. In all 
other cases, an associate judge may only submit findings and recommendations to 
the referring court. 
Here, Relator’s own filings establish that he withdrew consent and timely 
sought a de novo hearing, removing any statutory authority to enter the March 26 
orders. The record shows that on February 1, 2024, Relator signed an Associate 
Judge’s Report for “Agreed Temporary Orders”. Relator’s consent was not 
irrevocable, however. On February 9 he filed in the trial court a “Motion for 
Reconsideration and to Vacate Temporary Orders” which explicitly withdrew his 
consent and requested a hearing. This filing fell well within the three-working-day 
deadline of § 201.015(a). In compliance with § 201.015(f), the hearing was 
promptly set. Once Relator withdrew his agreement, the associate judge lost power

to enter any final order without a de novo hearing. Under § 201.007(c), the 
associate judge’s proposed order could not “become final” because Relator had 
requested de novo review. 
 Moreover, § 201.013(b) requires the referring judge’s signature for an 
unsigned associate judge’s order to take effect. Here the district court clerk filed 
the orders on March 26 with only his own attestation. Simply put, until the 
referring court formally approves the recommendation, no final order exists. And 
Id. § 201.015 sets out the appeal process by which parties can seek review before 
the referring court, thereby triggering the procedure in Id. § 201.013. Under these 
provisions, the associate judge’s decisions are not self-executing final judgments 
but must be presented to and adopted by the actual court of jurisdiction.  
The record shows that the referring court never signed any conforming order 
and that the procedural prerequisites of § 201.015 were not satisfied. Thus, even 
setting aside the consent issue, the orders never became the court’s own order as 
required. In light of  §§§ 201.007, 201.013, and 201.015, the trial court here plainly 
exceeded its statutory authority. The order it issued cannot be reconciled with the 
Family Code’s limitations and is thus unauthorized from its inception.  
C. The orders are void, the Relator has no adequate appellate remedy, and 
mandamus must issue to vacate them. 
 
Because the trial court acted beyond its lawful power, the orders it issued are 
void, not merely erroneous. As this court has previously explained, a judgment is

to enter any final order without a de novo hearing. Under § 201.007(c), the
associate judge’s proposed order could not “become final” because Relator had
requested de novo review.

Id. § 201.015 sets out the appeal process by which parties can seek review before

Family Code’s limitations and is thus unauthorized from its inception.

C. The orders are void, the Relator has no adequate appellate remedy, and
mandamus must issue to vacate them.

Because the trial court acted beyond its lawful power, the orders it issued are

void, not merely erroneous. As this court has previously explained, a judgment is

11

=== PAGE 12 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
12 
 
void when “the court rendering judgment had no jurisdiction of the parties or 
property, no jurisdiction of the subject matter, no jurisdiction to enter the particular 
judgment, or no capacity to act”. PNS Stores, Inc. v. Rivera, 379 S.W.3d 267, 271–
73 (Tex. 2012); Travelers Ins. Co. v. Joachim, 315 S.W.3d 860, 863 (Tex. 2010) 
(quoting Browning v. Prostok, 165S.W.3d at 346). Here, the trial court had no 
capacity to issue a judgment rendered without authority. Acting outside the scope 
of Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007 et seq. means the court lacked capacity to act in this 
case. Accordingly, the March 26, 2024, temporary orders are a nullity and should 
be declared as such.  
The Relator emphasizes that this situation is not akin to the scenario in 
Burnaman v. Heaton. Burnaman involved a consent judgment entered when one 
party’s approval had lapsed – a defect in the parties’ agreement, not in the court’s 
authority. In that context the judgment was held invalid for lack of consent at the 
moment of rendition. Id. 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 (Tex. 1951). While those 
circumstances apply here, there is not just a question of a party’s consent; the 
problem is the court’s own lack of statutory power under the Texas Family Code. 
Burnaman and its discussion of consent concern a different species of defect and 
do not save an order entered outside statutory authority. In sum, section 201.007, 
the legislature has not given associate judges the power to render judgment outside 
the context of an agreed order or default when a timely de novo request was made.

The Respondent may argue that a lack of consent or some procedural 
irregularity would merely render the order voidable. But that argument is 
misplaced. Here the defect is not a mere procedural error but a fundamental 
absence of statutory authorization. Under Texas law, a judgment rendered without 
any statutory basis is void and can be attacked at any time. Id. Indeed, this petition 
for mandamus arises precisely because the trial court issued an order it had no 
power to sign. Thus, the order has no legal effect. 
CONCLUSION 
Relator cannot wait for final appeal to fix the void orders: their continued 
effect causes ongoing harm each day and has persisted for thirteen months. 
Mandamus must issue now to vacate the void orders. Because the court acted 
beyond its statutory authority and rendered a consent judgement where consent 
was wanting, its actions constitute a clear abuse of discretion. And no remedy by 
appeal is available: void orders are not saved by an appeal. As the Supreme Court 
explained in Walker v. Packer, an appeal is inadequate to correct errors that exceed 
the court’s jurisdiction. Id., 827 S.W.2d 833, 840 (Tex. 1992) (orig. proceeding). 
Therefore, because the Family Code gave the trial court no power to enter the 
contested orders, those orders are void ab initio. Relator therefore prays that this 
Court grant the writ of mandamus and order the trial court to vacate the 
unauthorized orders.
