ANSWER AND MOTION TO
CONSOLIDATE

MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS,

Respondent.

2025-03-30

TO THE HONORABLE 233"! DISTRICT COURT:

Petitioner, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, respectfully submits this motion to strike
Respondent’s answer and motion to consolidate, and in support thereof, would show the court the

following:

I. STATEMENT OF FACTS

1. On March 20, 2025, Respondent, MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS, filed an answer

entering a general denial for the claims made against her and a motion to consolidate.

2. The response alleges that it was necessary for the Respondent to acquire the services of

Cooper L. Carter.

3. The Respondent’s answer and motion to consolidate were filed on Cooper Carter’s 
behalf by Roderick D. Marx, a party not named in either this suit or the related divorce suit (322-
744263-23). 
 
4. Roderick D. Marx has filed all pleadings on Cooper Carter’s behalf because Cooper 
Carter’s electronic filing manager credentials are registered under the law farm Cantey and 
Hangar, LLP. See Exhibit 1. 
 
5. Respondent’s answer and motion to consolidate are an attempt to subvert the relief the 
children desperately need, and failed to argue as to how these pleadings are in the best interests 
of the children. 
A. Sudden Activity after Months of Delay 
6. Respondent’s Answer asserts the existence of a prior divorce case (Cause No. 322-
744263-23) involving the parties as a basis to delay or abate this Suit Affecting Parent-Child 
Relationship (SAPCR). However, that divorce case has been stalled for months with no 
meaningful action by Respondent or her alleged counsel. Respondent’s counsel has failed to 
diligently prosecute the divorce matter, and a dormant case cannot justify stalling this separate 
SAPCR proceeding. In short, the children’s issues should not be put on hold due to an unrelated 
divorce case that remains inactive. 
B. SAPCR Suit Focus (Lack of Child-Related Response) 
7. This SAPCR is focused on the welfare and best interests of the children, yet the 
Respondent’s Original Answer is devoid of any substantive response regarding the children. 
Respondent merely states that the information required under Texas Family Code §§154.181(b) 
and 154.1815 “will be provided at a later date”and then enters a general denial. No specific

3. The Respondent’s answer and motion to consolidate were filed on Cooper Carter’s

4. Roderick D. Marx has filed all pleadings on Cooper Carter’s behalf because Cooper

5. Respondent’s answer and motion to consolidate are an attempt to subvert the relief the

of the children.

A. Sudden Activity after Months of Delay

6. Respondent’s Answer asserts the existence of a prior divorce case (Cause No. 322-
744263-23) involving the parties as a basis to delay or abate this Suit Affecting Parent-Child
Relationship (SAPCR). However, that divorce case has been stalled for months with no

diligently prosecute the divorce matter, and a dormant case cannot justify stalling this separate
SAPCR proceeding. In short, the children’s issues should not be put on hold due to an unrelated

divorce case that remains inactive.

B. SAPCR Suit Focus (Lack of Child-Related Response)

7. This SAPCR is focused on the welfare and best interests of the children, yet the
Respondent’s Original Answer is devoid of any substantive response regarding the children.
Respondent merely states that the information required under Texas Family Code §§154.181(b)
and 154.1815 “will be provided at a later date’’and then enters a general denial. No specific

conservatorship, support, or visitation issues are addressed at all. By failing to engage with the 
core child-related allegations in the Petition, Respondent’s Answer is irrelevant to the central 
issues of this proceeding and provides the Court with nothing of substance on the SAPCR 
matters. 
8. Respondent’s Answer claims that it was “necessary for Respondent to secure the 
services of COOPER L. CARTER, a licensed attorney, to prepare and defend this suit”. Yet the 
pleading was filed under the letterhead of Marx, Altman & Johnson (Attorney Roderick D. 
Marx’s firm) and is electronically signed by Cooper L. Carter as “Attorney for Respondent”. 
This inconsistency creates confusion as to who represents Respondent in this case. Texas practice 
expects clarity in counsel of record (see Tex. R. Civ. P. 8 requiring designation of lead counsel), 
but here Respondent’s Answer sends mixed signals by invoking Mr. Carter’s name and services 
while being filed through Mr. Marx’s firm. Such a contradiction in representation is procedurally 
improper and fails to clearly identify the attorney in charge of Respondent’s case. 
9. In addition to the above, there are irregularities in the manner Respondent’s Answer 
was filed. Upon information and belief, the Answer was submitted via an Electronic Filing 
Manager (EFM) account registered to Cooper L. Carter under the law firm Cantey & Hanger, 
which is not the firm appearing on the pleading. In other words, the electronic filing credentials 
used do not match the law firm or attorney officially listed on the document. This raises serious 
concerns about the validity of the filing and compliance with Texas e-filing rules (see Tex. R. 
Civ. P. 21(f)). Filings must be made by the attorney of record under their proper account for 
transparency and proper notice. Using an EFM account associated with a different firm (Cantey 
& Hanger) for a pleading filed under Marx, Altman & Johnson’s banner is a procedural anomaly 
that calls into question whether Respondent’s Answer was filed in accordance with the required

procedures.  Further, the email address COOPERCARTER@MAJADMIN.COM associated with 
the pleadings filed in this court is NOT registered under the EFM in which they were filed. 
10. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 21(f) requires that electronic ﬁlings be made through 
an authorized EFM account corresponding to the attorney of record. The use of an account 
registered under one ﬁrm (Cantey & Hanger) to ﬁle pleadings under a different ﬁrm’s name (Marx, 
Altman & Johnson) constitutes a procedural violation, undermining the validity of the ﬁling and 
raising concerns about whether the attorney of record actually authorized or executed the ﬁling. 
11. This discrepancy calls into question the legitimacy of Respondent’s Answer and 
warrants immediate review by the Court. Given the attorney filing the document did not use 
their own credentials under which the pleading was submitted, yet claimed her individual 
services were necessary, renders the filing as procedurally defective and should be struck 
from the record sua sponte. 
PRAYER FOR RELIEF 
12. Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court strike Respondent’s Original Answer 
and motion to consolidate in its entirety sua sponte. Petitioner further requests that Respondent 
be required to refile any answer or responsive pleading in compliance with all applicable 
procedural rules – including proper attorney-of-record designation and use of correct electronic 
filing credentials – and to ensure that any such pleading addresses the substantive SAPCR issues 
regarding the children. Petitioner also prays for such other and further relief, at law or in equity, 
to which he may be justly entitled.
