TO THE HONORABLE COURT:

CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, Respondent, appearing specially and under continuing
objection, files this Notice of Protest, Objection to Final Trial Setting, and Non-Appearance

Under Duress, respectfully showing the Court as follows:

I. Procedural History of Deprivation

Since the inception of these proceedings, each physical appearance made by CHARLES
MYERS before this Court has resulted in substantial and escalating deprivation of fundamental

rights:

1. First Appearance:

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
CHARLES MYERS appeared voluntarily to show cause why a protective order should 
not be entered against him, yet was immediately deprived of exclusive residence in his home 
and custody of his children without a proper evidentiary hearing or findings of fact supporting 
such drastic relief. This occurred on January 16, 2024. 
2. Second Appearance: 
Despite efforts to present meritorious issues, proceedings were delayed, providing no 
meaningful relief, and prolonging injury to familial and property rights due to Petitioner, 
MORGAN MYERS, retaining counsel minutes before the scheduled reset for January 22, 2024. 
Third Appearance: 
CHARLES MYERS was coerced into signing a purported "settlement agreement" 
under duress by his own attorney, without genuine consent, and under threat of further 
deprivation, leading to his termination and subsequent challenge of the proceedings. This 
occurred on February 1, 2024. 
Fourth Appearance: 
CHARLES MYERS appeared to challenge the fraudulent settlement; however, despite 
the lack of any opposition on record, relief was denied, and CHARLES MYERS was ordered to 
sign an agreement to which he never lawfully consented. This occurred on March 14, 2024. 
 
II. Present Circumstances Justifying Non-Appearance 
At this time, multiple critical matters remain pending, unresolved, or have been unlawfully 
denied, including:

II. Present Circumstances Justifying Non-Appearance

At this time, multiple critical matters remain pending, unresolved, or have been unlawfully

denied, including:

=== PAGE 3 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
i. 
A Rule 12 challenge to the authority of opposing counsel, leaving the question of proper 
representation unresolved; 
ii. Emergency motions for relief wrongfully denied without evidentiary hearing, findings, 
or adequate process; 
iii. Procedural injuries and prejudice inflicted upon the parties’ minor child during the 
Court’s delay and refusal to act, now culminating in physical injury to the child; 
iv. Plea to the Jurisdiction pending, which deprives the Court of authority to proceed to 
any final trial setting without proper adjudication; 
v. Motion to Recuse, properly filed pursuant to Rule 18a, which under Texas law mandates 
suspension of further substantive action pending its resolution. 
Given the Court's documented pattern of procedural violations, due process deprivations, 
and disregard for objections, any further appearance at this stage by CHARLES MYERS 
would expose him to additional irreparable harm without meaningful protection. 
 
III. Formal Objection and Protest 
Accordingly, CHARLES MYERS respectfully objects to any setting of a final trial or other 
substantive action until: 
i. 
The pending Motion to Recuse is heard and ruled upon in accordance with Rule 18a; 
ii. The Plea to the Jurisdiction is adjudicated; 
iii. The Rule 12 challenge to opposing counsel's authority is resolved;
