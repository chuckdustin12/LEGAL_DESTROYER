The analysis concludes that: 
1. The divorce case should be dismissed for want of prosecution due to Petitioner's failure 
to advance the case for nearly a year 
2. The current orders are void due to lack of consent and improper adoption by the referring 
court 
3. The 322nd District Court never acquired continuing exclusive jurisdiction over the 
children 
4. The new SAPCR was properly filed as an original proceeding and should not be 
consolidated, especially considering no motion to transfer has been filed. 
5. Ms. Carter's pleadings should be stricken due to her failure to respond to a Rule 12 
challenge 
6. The children's best interests require immediate relief without further procedural delays 
I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
A. Procedural History 
1. December 18, 2023: Divorce case filed in 322nd District Court with 60-day waiver. 
2. February 6, 2024: Respondent filed emergency motion challenging basis for agreement. 
3. March 14, 2024: Respondent’s motion was denied, basis for agreement became 
temporary orders.

II. LEGAL ANALYSIS 
A. Dismissal for Want of Prosecution 
Legal Framework 
1. Texas courts have authority to dismiss cases for want of prosecution under both Texas 
Rule of Civil Procedure 165a and the court's inherent power to manage its docket. The Texas 
Supreme Court recognized both bases for dismissal in Villarreal v. San Antonio Truck & 
Equipment, 994 S.W.2d 628 (Tex. 1999).

2. A party seeking affirmative relief has a duty to prosecute the case with due diligence. 
As stated in In re Conner, 458 S.W.3d 532 (Tex. 2015), “[t]he issue here is whether a trial court 
abuses its discretion by refusing to grant a motion to dismiss for want of prosecution in the face 
of unmitigated and unexplained delay. We hold that it does.” Id. 
3. In family law specifically, In re Marriage of Buster, 115 S.W.3d 141 (Tex. App.—
Texarkana 2003) emphasized the importance of moving family law cases toward resolution and 
upheld dismissal after extended inactivity. 
Application to Current Case 
4. The facts strongly support dismissal for want of prosecution: 
i. 
The divorce case has been pending for over 16 months 
ii. Petitioner's attorney has failed to prosecute the case since April 24, 2024 
iii. No substantive action taken for approximately 11 months 
iv. No responses to discovery, no substantive pleadings, no trial settings 
v. The only recent action was filing a Motion to Consolidate to block emergency 
relief 
5. This extended inactivity is precisely the type of conduct that Texas courts have 
consistently held, which justifies dismissal for want of prosecution. The court should dismiss the 
dormant divorce case and allow the new SAPCR to proceed independently to address the 
children's urgent needs.

B. Void Orders Due to Lack of Consent 
Legal Framework 
6. The Texas Supreme Court established in Burnaman v. Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 
(Tex. 1951) that: "A valid consent judgment cannot be rendered by a court when consent of one 
of the parties is wanting. It is not sufficient to support the judgment that a party's consent thereto 
may at one time have been given; consent must exist at the very moment the court undertakes to 
make the agreement the judgment of the court." 
7. The Court further held: "When a trial court has knowledge that one of the parties to a 
suit does not consent to a judgment, it is error to render a judgment purportedly by agreement; 
such a judgment is a nullity." 
8. This principle was reaffirmed in Padilla v. LaFrance, 907 S.W.2d 454 (Tex. 1995), 
which confirmed that a trial court cannot render an agreed judgment after a party has withdrawn 
consent to a settlement. 
Application to Current Case 
9. The orders in this case are void under Burnaman and its progeny because: 
i. 
The orders claim consent of all parties but only bear signatures of the Petitioner 
and counsel 
ii. Respondent contends he never gave consent to the orders 
iii. Respondent actively opposed the terms that locked him out of his home and 
separated him from the children

iv. The court was aware of the dispute regarding consent (Respondent filed an 
emergency motion challenging the basis for agreement) 
10. Under Texas law, if Respondent did not consent to the orders at the time they were 
rendered, they are void ab initio. The court should declare these orders void and vacate them. 
C. Associate Judge's Orders Never Properly Adopted 
Legal Framework 
11. Texas Family Code § 201.013(b) explicitly states: "Except as provided by Section 
201.007 (Powers of Associate Judge), if a request for a de novo hearing before the referring court 
is not timely filed, the proposed order or judgment of the associate judge becomes the order or 
judgment of the referring court only on the referring court's signing the proposed order or 
judgment." 
12. This requirement is mandatory, not discretionary. Without the District Judge's 
signature, the Associate Judge's order remains merely a "proposed" order. 
Application to Current Case 
13. The orders in this case were issued by an Associate Judge but allegedly never 
properly adopted or signed by the referring District Court. Under Texas Family Code § 
201.013(b), these orders never achieved the status of a final judgment of the court and have no 
legal effect as final orders. 
14. This defect alone would be sufficient to challenge their validity, even without the 
consent issues. The court should declare these orders void or vacate them due to the lack of 
proper adoption by the referring court.

D. No Continuing Exclusive Jurisdiction (CEJ) 
Legal Framework 
15. Texas Family Code § 155.001(a) provides: "A court acquires continuing, exclusive 
jurisdiction over the matters provided for by this title in connection with a child on the rendition 
of a final order." 
16. Critically, § 155.001(d) states: "Unless a final order has been rendered by a court of 
continuing, exclusive jurisdiction, a subsequent suit shall be commenced as an original 
proceeding." 
17. In In re Burk, 252 S.W.3d 736 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2008), the court held 
that CEJ is established only upon rendition of a final order, and temporary orders do not establish 
CEJ. 
Application to Current Case 
18. No final order was ever rendered in the divorce case because: 
i. 
The Associate Judge's orders were never properly signed by the referring District 
Court Judge (per § 201.013(b)) 
ii. The orders were void due to lack of consent (per Burnaman v. Heaton) 
19. Without a final order, the 322nd District Court never acquired CEJ over the children. 
Therefore, under § 155.001(d), the Respondent's new SAPCR was properly "commenced as an 
original proceeding" in the 233rd District Court. 
20. The motion to consolidate should be denied because the 322nd District Court does 
not have dominant jurisdiction over the children.

courts of equal jurisdiction, the court in which the suit was first filed has dominant jurisdiction. 
However, the Texas Supreme Court in Wyatt v. Shaw Plumbing Co., 760 S.W.2d 245, 247 (Tex. 
1988) recognized three exceptions to this rule: 
i. Conduct by a party that estops them from asserting prior active jurisdiction 
ii. Lack of persons to be joined if feasible 
iii. Lack of intent to prosecute the first lawsuit 
Application to Current Case 
         22. Even if the 322nd District Court had dominant jurisdiction (which it does not due to 
lack of CEJ), at least two exceptions to the first-filed rule apply: 
Estoppel by Conduct: 
i. 
Petitioner allowed the case to become completely dormant 
ii. Failed to comply with Rule 237a's notice requirements after federal remand 
iii. Effectively concealed the revival of the state case 
iv. Represented through inaction that she had abandoned the case 
     
Lack of Intent to Prosecute: 
i. 
For nearly a year, Petitioner took no action to advance the divorce

ii. No discovery, no responses, no settings 
iii. Only "revived" the divorce case as a strategic ploy to derail Respondent's 
emergency action 
23. The 233rd District Court is the appropriate forum to hear the current disputes because 
that case was initiated specifically to address the children's urgent needs, free from the 
entanglements of the stalled divorce. 
F. Attorney Misconduct - Rule 12 Challenge 
Legal Framework 
24. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12 provides that a party may file a sworn motion 
stating that they believe a suit is being prosecuted or defended without authority. The challenged 
attorney bears the burden of proving authority to act. If the attorney fails to show authority, the 
court "shall refuse to permit the attorney to appear in the cause and shall strike the pleadings if 
no person who is authorized to prosecute or defend appears." 
25. These consequences are mandatory, not discretionary. The court has no choice but to 
bar the attorney and strike the pleadings upon failure to show authority. 
Application to Current Case 
26. Respondent filed a verified Rule 12 motion on September 20, 2024, challenging 
Cooper L. Carter's authority. Ms. Carter has not responded to this challenge for over 6 months. 
Additional facts supporting the Rule 12 challenge include: 
i. 
Ms. Carter's e-filing account is registered under her prior employer's email 
address

months 
27. Under Rule 12, Ms. Carter's failure to respond to the challenge requires the court to 
refuse to permit her to appear in the case and strike all pleadings filed by her, including the 
Motion to Consolidate. 
G. Additional Attorney Misconduct 
 
Discovery Violations 
28. Ms. Carter failed to respond to Requests for Admissions served on September 17, 
2024, resulting in deemed admissions under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 198. She made no 
effort to withdraw or amend these deemed admissions, effectively conceding critical facts against 
her client. 
29. This constitutes a violation of her duties under Rules 193.2 and 193.5 to timely 
respond or amend discovery responses.

Rule 237a Violations 
30. After federal remand on December 6, 2024, Ms. Carter failed to: 
i. 
File the required certified copy of the remand order with the clerk 
ii. Provide Respondent with mandatory written notice of the remand 
31. This procedural violation prevents the case from moving forward properly and further 
demonstrates Ms. Carter's neglect of basic procedural duties. 
Abuse of Process 
31. Ms. Carter's sudden reappearance after nearly a year of inactivity solely to block 
emergency relief suggests improper purpose. Filing a Motion to Consolidate without addressing 
substantive issues appears designed to delay resolution rather than advance the case. 
This conduct violates: 
i. 
Rule 13 of Texas Rules of Civil Procedure (forbidding groundless filings brought 
in bad faith) 
ii. Texas Disciplinary Rule 3.02 (prohibiting positions that unreasonably delay 
resolution) 
H. Children's Best Interests 
Legal Framework 
32. Texas Family Code § 153.002 establishes: "The best interest of the child shall be the 
primary consideration of the court in determining the issues of conservatorship and possession of 
and access to the child."

This paramount standard must guide all decisions in cases involving children. 
Application to Current Case 
33. The children in this case are suffering ongoing harm: 
i. 
Subjected to psychological manipulation and medical neglect 
ii. Left home alone at night without supervision 
iii. Removed from Respondent's care and placed with elderly great-grandparents 
iv. Eldest child's academic performance has plummeted 
v. Emotionally estranged from both parents 
34. Every day that passes without corrective action leaves the children in an unstable, 
harmful environment. Consolidation would reward procedural stonewalling and cause further 
delay. The children's best interests require prompt resolution, which can only be achieved by 
denying consolidation, dismissing the dormant divorce case, and allowing the new SAPCR to 
proceed expeditiously. 
III. CONCLUSION AND RELIEF REQUESTED 
Based on the comprehensive legal analysis above, there are multiple independent grounds 
supporting the Respondent's entitlement to relief: 
1. The divorce case should be dismissed for want of prosecution under Rule 165a and the 
court's inherent power. 
2. The current orders are void due to lack of consent under Burnaman v. Heaton.

3. The Associate Judge's orders were never properly adopted under Texas Family Code § 
201.013(b). 
4. The 322nd District Court never acquired CEJ under Texas Family Code § 155.001. 
5. Exceptions to dominant jurisdiction apply under Wyatt v. Shaw Plumbing Co. 
6. Ms. Carter's pleadings should be stricken due to her failure to respond to a Rule 12 
challenge. 
7. Ms. Carter has engaged in multiple instances of misconduct warranting sanctions and 
referral to the State Bar. 
8. The children's best interests require immediate relief without further procedural delays 
Therefore, the Respondent is entitled to the following relief: 
i. Denial of Petitioner's Motion to Consolidate. 
ii. Declaration that the current orders are void and of no legal effect. 
iii. Dismissal of the divorce action (Cause No. 322-744263-23) for want of prosecution. 
iv. Striking of all pleadings filed by Cooper L. Carter due to her failure to show 
authority. 
v. Permission for the new SAPCR to proceed in the 233rd District Court to address the 
children's urgent needs. 
These remedies are supported by well-established Texas law and are necessary to protect the 
children's best interests, ensure procedural fairness, and maintain the integrity of the legal 
process. Without any opposition, the court has every ability to act.

NO. 233-765358-25 
 
IN THE 233RD DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
 
 
TO THE HONORABLE COURT: 
 
Petitioner, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, submits this notice to provide a different 
perspective into the current situation: 
I. BEFORE AND AFTER 
1. This side-by-side comparison illustrates the stark differences in the children’s 
quality of life, parental involvement, and household stability before and after the removal of 
the Father from the family home. It presents a clear, fact-based evaluation of how the familial 
environment, care structure, and overall wellbeing of the children have been significantly 
impacted. Each point demonstrates a substantial decline in stability, support, and morality—
raising urgent concerns about the children’s best interests, safety, and development under the 
current arrangement.

Petitioner, which is simply to return to the residence that he was unlawfully removed from so 
that he can begin rebuilding the status quo of the children. Finally, we compare the benefits 
versus the detriments if granting relief to Petitioner:

• Children will have help with 
homework from home and help 
preparing for STAR Testing. 
• The respondent will have to choose 
between co-habitation or reside in an 
alternate residence near-by. 
• Children will have frequent and 
continuous access to both parents. 
 
• Financial damages can be repaired. 
 
 
VII. CONCLUSION 
 
This situation is destructive, and truly a one-sided case. Respondent’s prolonged silence, 
in fact, says everything. Without any arguments or opposition on record, it begs the question as 
to how this situation has been permitted to persist as long as it has. The only drawbacks of 
granting relief fall on the Respondent – and are minor inconveniences at best that can never 
outweigh the benefits that the children would reap if relief were to be granted. All the Petitioner 
asked for in the beginning was time. Now, time has been wasted, and we remain in the same 
spot. The point is – the Mother cannot just fabricate family violence to have Father removed 
from the home – especially when she knew and benefitted from his at-home business operations 
which have since been significantly damaged. Despite all the harm done, the Petitioner is 
confident that it can be repaired, the family  can get back on track, and this process can be 
finalized without sacrificing the stability and well-being of the children that they have been 
accustomed to throughout their lives.

NO. 322-744263-23 
IN THE 322nd DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
TO THE HONORABLE JAMES MUNFORD: 
Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, submits his NOTICE OF INTENT TO 
SEEK AN EXTRAORDINARY WRIT OF PROHIBITION, and in support thereof, shows the 
following: 
I. INTRODUCTION
After over a year of one-sided litigation, this court has permitted a purported settlement 
agreement to destroy the lives of two children, their father’s livelihood, and have rewarded both 
the Petitioner and her attorney by refusing to prosecute the case. There is no excuse for allowing 
the Petitioner to blatantly deceive this court into acquiring agreed temporary orders without the 
consent of all parties through her attorney of record only to then fail to prosecute the case. This 
situation has resulted in unenforceable orders that remain facially void and now this court, after

TO THE HONORABLE JAMES MUNFORD:
Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, submits his NOTICE OF INTENT TO

SEEK AN EXTRAORDINARY WRIT OF PROHIBITION, and in support thereof, shows the

following:

I. INTRODUCTION

After over a year of one-sided litigation, this court has permitted a purported settlement
agreement to destroy the lives of two children, their father’s livelihood, and have rewarded both
the Petitioner and her attorney by refusing to prosecute the case. There is no excuse for allowing
the Petitioner to blatantly deceive this court into acquiring agreed temporary orders without the
consent of all parties through her attorney of record only to then fail to prosecute the case. This

situation has resulted in unenforceable orders that remain facially void and now this court, after

months of inaction, is seeking to set an improperly filed consolidation motion used as a tactic to 
stall emergency relief. 
Notably, the participation from Petitioner resurfaces again only in the face of an 
emergency TRO. It doesn’t come with good faith or arguments; it only comes with a false sense 
of urgency by the opposing counsel in this matter. This court has sat on its’ hands for months, 
and then despite the failure to prosecute from the other side, it chooses to act on the wrong 
motion. Such a display is legally improper, unjustified, and showcases the complete disregard for 
what would otherwise be a prima facie case warranting dismissal for want of prosecution.  
Now, rather than acting sua sponte to set the DWOP for hearing, the court instead 
chooses to entertain a prematurely filed consolidation motion which it has no jurisdiction to rule 
on. As the Texas Supreme Court has held previously: “[a] plaintiff has a duty to “prosecut[e] the 
suit to a conclusion with reasonable diligence,” failing which a trial court may dismiss for want 
of prosecution.” In re Conner, 458 S.W.3d 532 (Tex. 2015) (citing Callahan v. Staples, 139 Tex. 
8, 161 S.W.2d 489, 491 (1942)). The court has wide discretion to manage its’ docket, so it begs 
the question as to why the court wants to act on its own accord on a motion to consolidate before 
the case is properly transferred. 
Although the writ of prohibition is intended to prevent this Court from setting a matter 
for hearing that is procedurally improper, the issue in this case mirrors that addressed by the 
Texas Supreme Court in In re Conner, 458 S.W.3d 532 (Tex. 2015). There, the Court considered 
whether a trial court abuses its discretion by refusing to grant a motion to dismiss for want of 
prosecution in the face of unmitigated and unexplained delay—and held that it does. That is 
precisely the circumstance presented here, and this intended writ of prohibition is to prevent this 
court from causing even further delays by setting a matter for a hearing which it has no

jurisdiction to rule on, and give the court the ability to dismiss this case for want of prosecution 
given that it has the discretion to do so, and no opposition to it from the opposing party. 
II. LEGAL FRAMEWORK 
A. Writ of Prohibition 
A writ of prohibition is an extraordinary legal remedy that serves specific, limited 
purposes in the Texas legal system. It is a judicial order issued by a higher court to prevent a 
lower court from exceeding its jurisdiction or interfering with the higher court's determination of 
a case. 
Key characteristics of a writ of prohibition include: 
1. Limited Purpose Remedy: A writ of prohibition is used to protect the subject matter of 
an appeal or to prohibit unlawful interference with enforcement of a superior court's 
judgment (Sivley v. Sivley, 972 S.W.2d 850, 863, Tex. App.—Tyler 1998). 
2. Preventive Nature: The writ is designed to prevent future actions, not to remedy acts 
already completed. It can only be used to prevent what is about to be or could be done, 
not as a remedy for acts that are already completed (United States v. Hoffman, 71 U.S. 
158, 1866). Here, Respondent seeks to use this writ as a means to prevent the court from 
causing further delays by setting opposing counsel’s improper motion to consolidate. 
3. Extraordinary Remedy: Courts have characterized a writ of prohibition as a "drastic 
remedy" and the legal equivalent of an equitable injunction (In re Lewis, 223 S.W.3d 756, 
761, Tex. App.—Texarkana 2007). This is a drastic circumstance. The Respondent has

jurisdiction to rule on, and give the court the ability to dismiss this case for want of prosecution

Ul. LEGAL FRAMEWORK

A. Writ of Prohibition

A writ of prohibition is an extraordinary legal remedy that serves specific, limited
purposes in the Texas legal system. It is a judicial order issued by a higher court to prevent a
lower court from exceeding its jurisdiction or interfering with the higher court's determination of

a Case.

Key characteristics of a writ of prohibition include:

1. Limited Purpose Remedy: A writ of prohibition is used to protect the subject matter of
an appeal or to prohibit unlawful interference with enforcement of a superior court's

judgment (Sivley v. Sivley, 972 S.W.2d 850, 863, Tex. App.—Tyler 1998).

2. Preventive Nature: The writ is designed to prevent future actions, not to remedy acts

not as a remedy for acts that are already completed (United States v. Hoffman, 71 U.S.

causing further delays by setting opposing counsel’s improper motion to consolidate.

3. Extraordinary Remedy: Courts have characterized a writ of prohibition as a "drastic
remedy" and the legal equivalent of an equitable injunction (/n re Lewis, 223 S.W.3d 756,

761, Tex. App.—Texarkana 2007). This is a drastic circumstance. The Respondent has

M.2008 M.2008

4 
 
been barred from his own residence for over a year without any explanation, and without 
any case prosecution in a one-sided effort to obtain relief from facially void orders. 
4. Last Resort: Prohibition is not appropriate if any other remedy, such as appeal, is 
available and adequate (In re Castle Tex. Prod. Ltd. P'ship, 189 S.W.3d 400, 404, Tex. 
App.—Tyler 2006). Here, Respondent has no adequate remedy by appeal, because there 
is currently no court with continuous, exclusive jurisdiction over the children in this 
matter. 
III. STATEMENT OF FACTS 
5. On January 24, 2025, after more than 11 months of inaction, Petitioner filed a Motion 
to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution in this court. The divorce case has had no substantive action 
from Petitioner since April 2024, a legal ghost ship drifting without direction or purpose. That 
motion wasn’t attempted to be set for hearing until September of 2024, only after the 
Respondent exhausted all efforts seeking relief throughout the Texas Judiciary without any 
participation from the opposing side. 
6. On March 19, 2025, driven by mounting concerns about the children’s welfare and 
learning that the 322nd District Court did not have continuous, exclusive jurisdiction over the 
children in this matter, Petitioner filed a new SAPCR in the 233rd District Court (Cause No. 233-
765358-25) seeking emergency relief for the children. The very next day, March 20, 2025, Ms. 
Carter suddenly reappeared like a character presumed missing in the second act, filing an answer 
to the SAPCR petition in this Court and thereby submitting to this Court’s jurisdiction by filing a 
response rather than a motion to abate.

7. On March 21, 2025, Respondent filed a verified Rule 12 motion challenging Ms. 
Carter’s authority in the 233rd to represent Petitioner in the matter—the second such challenge, 
met with the same resounding silence as the first. 
8. On March 25, 2025, Respondent filed an Objection to Consolidation and an Ex-Parte 
Emergency Motion for TRO in the 233rd. Two days later, on March 27, 2025, Respondent 
contacted the court coordinator, requested a date and time to present the motion, and served the 
documents to the opposing party with the intent to present on March 28, 2025, at 9:00 A.M. 
before the Associate Judge of this Court. On that fateful morning of March 28, 2025, Respondent 
drove to the courthouse, paid for parking, met with the coordinator, communicated with 
opposing counsel, and secured a hearing date of April 10, 2025 agreed by the parties. 
Respondent then proceeded to the Associate Judge’s courtroom to present the TRO. 
9. Before Respondent could present his case—before he could speak a single word about 
his children’s welfare—he was told that Ms. Carter would be filing a motion to consolidate in the 
322nd District Court, that his motion was improperly before the 233rd court, and the Associate 
Judge refused to hear the motion. It was a curious thing, this refusal. Ms. Carter wasn’t even 
present in the courtroom, yet her words carried more weight than Respondent’s physical 
presence, his properly filed papers, and most importantly, the urgent needs of his children. She 
stopped the proceedings with nothing more than word of mouth for the incorrect motion. A true 
showcasing of disregard for the process, and the children. 
10. On April 2, 2025, Respondent filed a Pre-Objection to Motion to Consolidate in the 
322nd District Court. Ms. Carter’s motion to consolidate wasn’t filed with the 322nd District 
Court until April 3, 2025, six days after she used its mere possibility to prevent the 233rd Court

from hearing Respondent’s emergency motion. Her motion disregarded Respondent’s pre-
objection entirely, as if it were invisible ink on the page. 
11. On April 4, 2025, unable to acquire a ruling due to Respondent’s objection, Ms. 
Carter attempted to set the motion for a hearing before the 322nd District Court. That same day, 
Respondent filed a Pre-Objection to Motion to Transfer in the 233rd Court, given that a motion 
to transfer must come before any attempt at consolidation. Ms. Carter, who had been so urgently 
concerned about consolidation when it served to block Respondent’s emergency hearing, 
suddenly claimed to be unavailable until late April—causing significant delays that could have 
been avoided had the 233rd Court simply heard the motion before it on March 28, 2025. 
12. Throughout this period of procedural maneuvering, the children have been subjected 
to psychological manipulation and medical neglect. They have been removed from Petitioner’s 
care and placed with elderly great-grandparents on a daily basis, and are being gaslighted into a 
false belief that the divorce is finalized. Respondent’s eldest child’s academic performance has 
plummeted, and both children have become emotionally estranged from both parents. 
Respondent has suffered approximately $110,500 in verifiable financial damages due to being 
locked out of his home and business, and it grows each day. But the financial toll pales in 
comparison to the emotional cost of watching Respondent’s children suffer while the courts 
exchange procedurally incorrect volleys over his head.  
IV. THE PROHIBITION PREDICAMENT 
13. The writ of prohibition exists for precisely this sort of situation—where a court is 
about to act in a way that exceeds its authority and threatens to compound an already untenable 
situation. The law on this matter is as clear as a bell on a still morning:

A. The Procedural Parade Must Follow Its Proper Order 
14. The Texas Family Code establishes a clear sequence for the consolidation of cases 
from different courts. First, a motion to transfer must be filed and granted, bringing both cases 
into the same court. Only then may a motion to consolidate be considered. See Tex. Fam. Code 
§§ 155.201 and 6.407. 
15. This isn't merely a matter of dotting i's and crossing t's—it's the fundamental roadmap 
that ensures cases proceed in an orderly fashion. A court cannot consolidate what it does not 
possess, any more than a chef can cook ingredients that haven't yet been delivered to the kitchen. 
16. The Texas Supreme Court has consistently held that courts must follow proper 
procedural sequence. In re Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., 35 S.W.3d 602, 605 (Tex. 2000). When a 
court attempts to rule on a matter for which it lacks jurisdiction or authority, prohibition is the 
appropriate remedy. In re Lewis, 223 S.W.3d 756, 761 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2007, orig. 
proceeding). 
17. Respondent is no legal scholar with a library of case law memorized, but even he can 
see that this principle is as plain as a full moon on a cloudless night. This Court's potential 
willingness to hear a motion to consolidate before a motion to transfer has been filed and granted 
would be like a judge sentencing a defendant before the trial has begun—a clear inversion of the 
proper order of legal proceedings. 
B. The Discretion Dilemma 
18. The writ of prohibition as used in Texas has three functions:  1) preventing 
interference with higher courts in deciding a pending appeal, 2) preventing inferior courts from 
entertaining suits that will relitigate controversies which have already been settled by issuing

courts, and 3) prohibiting a trial court's action when it affirmatively appears that the court lacks 
jurisdiction. Texas Capital Bank-Westwood v. Johnson, 864 S.W.2d 186, 187 (Tex.App.-
Texarkana 1993, orig. proceeding). Here, function three is directly relevant. A court cannot hear a 
motion to consolidate a case it does not have before it.  
C. Opposing Counsel's Conduct 
19. Ms. Carter's behavior throughout this saga deserves special attention, like a character 
in a novel whose actions consistently contradict their stated intentions. 
20. She abandoned the divorce case for nearly a year, filing nothing since April 2024, 
only to suddenly reappear when Respondent sought emergency relief for the children—like a 
firefighter who ignores a smoldering house for months, only to rush in when someone else calls 
for help. 
21. She filed an answer in the 233rd Court, thereby submitting to its jurisdiction, only to 
then argue that the case belongs in this Court—a contradiction as glaring as claiming to be both 
inside and outside a room simultaneously. 
22. She used the mere possibility of a future filing to block an emergency hearing, then 
waited six days to file the motion—a delay that speaks volumes about the true urgency of the 
matter. 
23. She filed a motion to consolidate without first filing a motion to transfer, putting the 
procedural cart before the horse in a manner that defies both logic and law.

24. She now claims to be unavailable until late April, creating further delay after using 
the urgency of consolidation to block Respondent’s emergency hearing—a scheduling 
contradiction that would be comical if not for the children caught in its web. 
25. This pattern reveals a tactical attempt to manipulate both courts' dockets to prevent 
me from obtaining timely relief. It's a shell game played with Respondent’s children's welfare as 
the prize. This Court should not allow itself to be used as an instrument in such procedural 
gamesmanship, particularly when children's lives hang in the balance. 
V. MORAL FIBER 
26. If there's a lesson to be drawn from this procedural quagmire, it's that the law's 
complexity should never obscure its fundamental purpose: to provide justice, particularly for 
those most vulnerable. My children—innocent bystanders in this adult conflict—have become 
collateral damage in a game of procedural chess where the rules seem to change with each move. 
27. It has been stated that the true measure of a society is found in how it treats its most 
vulnerable members. By that measure, the procedural labyrinth that has prevented the 233rd 
Court from hearing Respondent’s emergency motion, and now threatens to compound the error 
by having this Court act prematurely, speaks volumes about how far we have strayed from the 
ideal of justice. 
28. Respondent provide this notice not out of anger or vindictiveness, but out of that 
quiet, bewildered astonishment that settles in a person's bones when they've witnessed the law 
being twisted into shapes that would make a carnival contortionist blush with envy. Respondent 
followed the rules. He honored the procedures. He placed his faith in a system that promised 
justice would flow like water, clear and unobstructed, to those who seek it properly.

29. Behind every case number, behind every filing, behind every procedural rule, there 
are real children with real lives that continue whether the courts act or not. Time doesn't stop for 
them while adults sort out procedural disagreements. They grow, they hurt, they form memories 
and impressions that will shape them for a lifetime. 
30. As Mark Twain might have observed, the difference between proper procedure and 
improper procedure is not merely academic—it's the difference between justice served and 
justice denied, between children protected and children neglected, between a system that works 
and one that merely pretends to. 
VI. CONCLUSION AND PRAYER 
31. I respectfully request that this Court pause, reflect on the procedural peculiarity 
before it, and decline to hear a motion to consolidate until the proper preliminary steps have been 
taken. Specifically, I ask that this Court: 
a. Recognize that it lacks jurisdiction to hear a motion to consolidate until a motion to 
transfer has been filed in the 233rd Court and granted; 
b. Take judicial notice that Petitioner submitted to the 233rd Court's jurisdiction by 
answering the SAPCR petition; 
c. Acknowledge the improper procedural sequence attempted by Petitioner's counsel in 
filing a motion to consolidate without first filing a motion to transfer; 
d. Consider that proceeding with a hearing on the consolidation motion would only 
compound the procedural irregularities and further delay relief for the children;

e. Recognize that the 233rd Court has the power and jurisdiction to address the 
emergency concerns raised in my TRO motion, which remains unopposed on the record. 
f. Using the court’s own inherent power, dismiss the divorce outright for failure to 
prosecute given the circumstances of this case. 
Respondent understands that in most situations, courts give deference to licensed attorneys over 
self-represented litigants. But the procedural impropriety here is so glaring, so fundamental, that 
it transcends the usual presumptions. Even a layperson can see that you cannot consolidate what 
you do not possess, just as you cannot serve a meal with ingredients you haven't yet purchased. 
The children deserve better than to have their fate determined by procedural sleight of hand. 
They deserve courts that follow the law's clear sequence, that prioritize substance over form, and 
that remember that behind every procedural rule are real lives hanging in the balance. The truth 
of this matter can only be revealed once the injustices are duly corrected by this court. 
 
Respondent has filed a similar notice to the 233rd court informing of the intent to file a 
writ of mandamus to compel a ruling on the emergency TRO that was unlawfully blocked from 
being heard by COOPER L. CARTER.

15. The court, at this point, is choosing to not grant relief despite having no reason 
to do so. 
16. This litigation has no possible means to an end, and it should be dismissed 
outright so that the SAPCR may continue. 
17. There has been no filed opposition, objection, or arguments made against the 
Respondent’s position in either suit. 
18. The Petitioner has wasted everyone’s time, caused significant damage, and 
remains hidden in fear of being held accountable. 
19. The Petitioner prioritized an extramarital affair over prosecuting the divorce, 
and the children and Respondent have been significantly harmed. 
Therefore, this case should be dismissed as a matter of law. Every day causes more 
irreparable harm, and this court has every ability and reason to rectify this situation immediately. 
Respondent already has the solution and has been the only party in this matter seeking relief. It is 
simply unacceptable to permit this to continue.

Statement of the Case 
Nature of Underlying Proceeding: This original proceeding arises from a Suit 
Affecting the Parent-Child Relationship ("SAPCR") involving two minor children, 
M.E.M. and C.R.M., in which Relator filed an emergency ex parte application for 
temporary restraining order ("TRO") in the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County, 
Texas. The underlying SAPCR (Cause No. 233-765358-25) was a new proceeding 
initiated by Relator on March 19, 2025, and was answered on March 20, 2025. 
There is a related divorce matter (322-744263-23) that has not been prosecuted 
since April 24, 2024, and no final orders have been rendered. Relator seeks 
declaratory and injunctive relief preventing the Real Party in Interest from barring 
Relator’s from accessing his home, business, and children until valid orders are 
rendered that reflect the children’s best interests. 
Respondent Judge: The Respondent Judge, Kate Stone, is the presiding Associate 
Judge of the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County, Texas. Her office is located at 
200 E. Weatherford St. 5th Floor Fort Worth, TX 76196-0227. 
Respondent’s Challenged Actions and inaction: The trial court refused to hear 
an emergency motion before it on March 28, 2025, and used out-of-court 
statements made by the opposing counsel regarding a forward looking 
consolidation motion that would be filed at a later date, and denied to hear the 
motion after a full hearing date was agreed upon by both parties for April 10, 2025.

Issues Presented 
 
B. Are the March 14, 2024, temporary orders rendered by an Associate 
Judge void ab initio because they explicitly state that all parties agree to 
the terms of the order yet only contain the signatures of the opposing 
party and were never properly adopted by the referring court? 
 
C. Did the Respondent abuse her discretion by failing to perform a clear 
ministerial duty when she refused to consider and rule on Relator's 
properly filed ex parte emergency Application for TRO? 
 
D. Did the Respondent further abuse her discretion un-setting the matter for 
a hearing, and favoring a forward-looking consolidation motion as the 
grounds for denying to hear the emergency TRO before a transfer was 
filed? 
 
E. The Relator has been left without an adequate remedy for an appeal 
because no order resulted from the Respondent judge’s refusal to act on 
Relator’s emergency TRO. 
 
F. Did the Respondent clearly abuse her discretion by excluding any 
exhibits related to the emergency TRO?

ARGUMENT 
A. Mandamus Standard 
Mandamus relief is not merely appropriate but imperative in this case 
because the trial court's inaction and the continued enforcement of a void order 
constitute a clear abuse of discretion for which Relator has no adequate remedy at 
law. The Texas Supreme Court has consistently and unequivocally held that to 
obtain mandamus relief, a Relator must show (1) the trial court clearly abused its 
discretion or violated a duty imposed by law, and (2) there is no adequate remedy 
by appeal. In re Bass, 113 S.W.3d 735, 738 (Tex. 2003) (orig. proceeding); Walker 
v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 839 (Tex. 1992). 
Texas jurisprudence firmly establishes that mandamus will lie to correct a 
void order, even without a traditional showing of inadequate appellate remedy. As 
the Supreme Court of Texas definitively stated in Urbish v. 127th Judicial Dist. 
Court, 708 S.W.2d 429, 431 (Tex. 1986) (orig. proceeding), mandamus will issue 
to correct a void order, i.e., an order the trial court had no power or jurisdiction to 
render. The Court has further emphasized in In re Sw. Bell Tel. Co., 35 S.W.3d 602, 
605 (Tex. 2000) (orig. proceeding) that if an order is void, the Relator need not 
show he lacks an adequate appellate remedy, and mandamus relief is appropriate. 
This principle was recently reaffirmed in In re J.R., No. 02-21-00060-CV, 2021 
WL 1421440 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth Apr. 15, 2021, orig. proceeding), where the

court explicitly stated: "A trial court abuses its discretion if it enters a void order, 
and mandamus will issue to remedy the void order regardless of whether the relator 
has an adequate remedy by appeal." 
B. The temporary orders rendered on March 14, 2024, are void ab initio 
A fundamental and inviolable principle in Texas jurisprudence is that a 
judgment based on a settlement requires the consent of both parties at the time it is 
rendered by the court. The Texas Supreme Court's seminal decision in Burnaman v. 
Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 (1951) established the bedrock principle that a party 
is free to withdraw their consent to a settlement at any time before the judgment is 
rendered. The Court's language was unambiguous and leaves no room for 
interpretation: "A valid consent judgment cannot be rendered by a court when 
consent of one of the parties thereto is wanting. It is not sufficient that a party's 
consent may at one time have been given; consent must exist at the very moment 
the court undertakes to make the agreement the judgment of the court." Id. This 
principle has been consistently reaffirmed, as in Carter v. Carter, 535 S.W.2d 215 
(Tex. Civ. App. 1976), which emphasized that "the law seems to be clear that a 
consent judgment cannot be rendered by a trial court when consent of one of the 
parties is lacking, even though that consent may have been previously given." 
In the present case, the only orders rendered by any court were rendered as 
consent judgments but lack the signatures of all parties. The orders themselves

explicitly state "As evidenced by the signatures below, all parties agree to the terms

CONSENTED TO AS TO BOTH FORM AND SUBSTANCE" yet crucially lacks 
the signature of the Relator and his prior counsel. APP 2.38. The Court must 
recognize that the absence of the Relator’s signature is not a mere technical 
deficiency but a fatal jurisdictional flaw that renders the orders void ab initio. 
Because his signature was required to effectuate consent, and the orders themselves 
acknowledge this requirement, the orders are unquestionably void. 
C. Outright refusing to hear the emergency TRO is a clear abuse of discretion  
It is well-settled and beyond legitimate dispute that a trial court has a 
ministerial duty to consider and rule on motions that have been properly filed and 
brought to the court's attention. The Texas Court of Appeals has emphatically 
stated, "When a motion is properly filed and pending before the trial court, the act 
of giving consideration to and ruling upon that motion is a ministerial act, and 
mandamus may issue to compel the trial judge to act." Safety-Kleen Corp. v. 
Garcia, 945 S.W.2d 268, 269 (Tex. App.- San Antonio 1997, orig. proceeding). To 
establish an abuse of discretion for refusal to rule, the relator must show: (1) the 
trial court had a legal duty to perform a nondiscretionary act, (2) the relator 
requested performance of that act, and (3) the trial court failed or refused to do so.

In re Shredder Co., L.L.C., 225 S.W.3d 676, 679 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2006, orig. 
proceeding). 
Here, the Relator properly filed his emergency TRO application in the 233rd 
District Court, meticulously followed all procedural requirements, and appeared at 
the scheduled time to present at 9:00 A.M. on March 28, 2025. SUPP 2.11 The 
Court must recognize that the court's refusal to even consider the application—
based solely on an opposing counsel's unverified, informal representation about a 
future filing in another court—constitutes a clear and inexcusable failure to 
perform a ministerial duty – especially when no response or opposition to the TRO 
was filed by the opposing party and that same party was permitted to interfere with 
the proceedings without being present in the courtroom. SUPP 2.19 
The refusal is particularly troubling because 1) The TRO application 
involved un-opposed allegations of immediate harm to children, which courts are 
obligated to address promptly; 2) the refusal was due to a forward looking 
consolidation motion; 3) even if a motion to consolidate had been filed, it would 
not automatically divest the 233rd Court of jurisdiction until actually granted; and 
4) the proper procedure would have been a motion to transfer, not consolidation. 
See Tex. Fam. Code § 6.407. This misapplication of the law resulted in the refusal 
to hear a properly filed motion to favor a procedurally improper motion that hadn’t

In In re Blakeney, 254 S.W.3d 659, 661 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2008, orig. 
proc.), the court held that mandamus is appropriate when a trial court refuses to 
rule on a properly filed motion and the relator has no adequate remedy by appeal. 
That is precisely the situation here. The 233rd Court's refusal to even consider 
Relator's emergency TRO application has left him with no forum to address his 
urgent concerns about the children's welfare, as the case before the 322nd has been 
procedurally abandoned and Relator has been seeking relief from facially void 
temporary orders to no avail since March 14, 2024, without any opposition from 
the opposing counsel. SUPP 3.2 
D. Improper consolidation does not justify the refusal to act 
The 233rd Court’s refusal to act was based on a fundamentally flawed legal 
premise: that the 322nd District Court had continuing exclusive jurisdiction over 
the children. Under Texas Family Code § 155.001, a court acquires continuing 
exclusive jurisdiction over children only when it renders a “final order” in a 
SAPCR. It is undisputed that the 322nd Court never rendered any final order 
regarding the children. Without a final order, the 322nd Court never acquired 
continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the children. Therefore, the 233rd Court 
was entirely within its authority to hear and rule on Relator’s emergency TRO 
application pursuant to § 155.001.

Moreover, even if the 322nd Court had continuing exclusive jurisdiction 
(which it does not), the proper procedure would have been a motion to transfer 
under the Family Code, not consolidation. Consolidation is appropriate for related 
cases within the same court, not for transferring jurisdiction between courts. By 
refusing to act based on an anticipated consolidation motion, the 233rd Court 
fundamentally misapplied the law, as consolidation cannot be effectuated prior to 
the transfer of the action. Tex. Fam. Code § 6.407. 
Rather, opposing counsel could have filed a plea in abatement but instead 
chose to Respond to the SAPCR after not prosecuting the divorce case since April 
24, 2024. 
E. Relator has been left with no adequate remedy by an appeal 
 
Because the 233rd District Court outright refused to hear the emergency 
TRO before it and the appearance before the court produced no order, the Relator 
has been left without an adequate remedy for an appeal. The Texas Supreme Court 
has recognized that mandamus relief is appropriate when "a party's ability to 
present a viable claim or defense is vitiated or severely compromised." In re 
Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 136 (Tex. 2004). That is precisely the 
situation here. The Relator has diligently sought relief in a one-sided case to no 
avail, and the 233rd SAPCR was opened to escape the abandoned divorce suit that 
hasn't been prosecuted since April 24th, 2024, and has no valid orders in effect.

present a viable claim or defense is vitiated or severely compromised." Jn re
Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 136 (Tex. 2004). That is precisely the
situation here. The Relator has diligently sought relief in a one-sided case to no
avail, and the 233rd SAPCR was opened to escape the abandoned divorce suit that

hasn't been prosecuted since April 24th, 2024, and has no valid orders in effect.

F. Refusal to accept relevant exhibits central to the emergency TRO 
 
On April 9th, 2025, Relator attempted to file a NOTICE OF INCLUSION 
with the trial court, which included critical exhibits related to the emergency TRO. 
The Judge refused outright to permit Relator to include any exhibits related to the 
TRO in the rejection comments. SUPP 2.13, 2.16 When contacting the clerk's 
office, no substantive response was received from the court coordinator. The 
returned comment stated: "Judge’s request. Please resubmit without the attached 
exhibits" without citing any legal authority, statute, rule, or local procedure 
justifying this rejection. SUPP 1.1. 
This rejection by the clerk constitutes a clear violation of the Texas Rules of 
Civil Procedure. Rule 21(f)(11) states: "The clerk may not refuse to file a 
document that fails to conform with this rule." Instead, the rule provides that the 
clerk "may identify the error to be corrected and state a deadline for the party to 
resubmit the document in a conforming format." Here, the clerk provided no 
specific error to be corrected, and no legal basis for the rejection outside of “we are 
unable to accept any exhibits into the case”. SUPP 1.1 By doing so, the Relator has 
been deprived of essential privileges to make a record pursuant to Tex. Const Art. 
1, § 19. 
Moreover, Rule 59 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure states: “Notes, 
accounts, bonds, mortgages, records, and all other written instruments,

constituting, in whole or in part, the claim sued on, or the matter set up in defense, 
may be made a part of the pleadings by copies thereof, or the originals, being 
attached or filed and referred to as such, or by copying the same in the body of the 
pleading in aid and explanation of the allegations in the petition or answer made in 
reference to said instruments and shall be deemed a part thereof for all purposes.” 
The request to remove the exhibits specifically for the emergency TRO without 
any statutory backing raises suspicion that the trial court is actively trying to 
prevent the record from being properly established. 
Finally, by rejecting exhibits central to Relator's emergency TRO application 
without legal justification, the clerk has effectively denied Relator the ability to 
make a complete record and present all relevant evidence to this court, thereby 
impairing Relator's due process rights. The rejected exhibits have been served on 
the opposing party and will be included in the supplemental record pursuant to Tex. 
R. App. P. § 52.7(b). 
 
CONCLUSION AND PRAYER 
 
Relator has been seeking relief for his children for over a year while the  
opposing party has failed to prosecute their case. They obtained orders by falsely 
claiming consent and then abandoned their case. There have been no filed 
responses to any relief sought by the Relator, no objections filed, and if the Relator 
had not opened the SAPCR to seek relief for his Children, there was no indication

that the real party in interest ever intended to move the dormant divorce proceeding 
towards final trial. There are no valid, legally binding orders in effect, yet they 
have been used to control the Relator’s livelihood and have destroyed the 
children’s status quo. The opposing counsel only resurfaced at the 11th hour in a 
separate proceeding for the sole purpose of interfering with the relief sought by the 
Relator without even being present in the courtroom. SUPP 2.19 
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Relator Charles Dustin Myers 
respectfully prays that this Court: 
1. Issue a writ of mandamus directing Respondent, the Honorable Kate Stone, 
Associate Judge of the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County, Texas, to hear 
and rule on Relator's Emergency Application for Temporary Restraining 
Order at the earliest practical date; 
2. Grant the emergency temporary relief requested in Relator's separate 
Emergency Motion under TRAP 52.10, filed concurrently with this petition 
because the orders are facially void; 
3. Take judicial notice that Relator has been unlawfully barred from his 
matrimonial residence and children under these void orders for over a year 
while the real party in interest has remained completely silent;

3. Standing
The law allows me to file this case because | am: (Check one.)
[] the mother of the child(ren).

[Ml the “legal father’ of the child(ren). An Acknowledgment of Paternity form has been signed and filed
with the Vital Statistics Unit for each child. A copy of each Acknowledgment of Paternity is attached to
this Petition.

[] a person who has had actual care, control, and possession of the child(ren) for at least 6 months
ending not more than 90 days before the date this Petition is filed with the Court. | am not a foster
parent.

CL] a person who lived with the child(ren) and the child(ren)’s parent, guardian, or managing conservator
for at least 6 months ending not more than 90 days before the date this Petition is filed with the Court,
and the child(ren)’s parent, guardian, or managing conservator is now dead.

[] the grandparent, great-grandparent, sister, brother, aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew of the child(ren)
and: (Check the box below that applies to your case.)

[] both parents are dead.
[1] both parents, the surviving parent, or managing conservator agree to me filing this case.

[] the child(ren)’s present circumstances will significantly impair (harm) the child(ren)’s physical
health or emotional development.

[] other:
(Read the law about standing in Texas Family Code Sections 102.003, 102.004 and 102.006)

Note: If you are the mother or biological father of the child/ren and an Acknowledgment of Paternity form has
not been signed and filed for each child, you may need to file a paternity case instead of a Suit Affecting the

Parent-Child Relationship (SAPCR) case. Get information about filing a paternity case at
www. TexasLawHelp.org.

4. Jurisdiction

There are no court orders about any of the child(ren). No other Court has continuing jurisdiction over this
case or the child(ren).

Texas has authority to decide this case because: (Check one.)
[ml The children live in Texas now and have lived in Texas for at least the past 6 months or since birth.

[] The children do not live in Texas now, but they have been gone from Texas less than 6 months. The
children had lived in Texas for at least 6 months before they moved. A parent or person acting as a
parent continues to live in Texas.

Important: Talk to a lawyer if neither of the above applies.

M.2055

Note: If there is already a court order about any of the children, you may need to file a modification case instead
of a Suit Affecting the Parent-Child Relationship (SAPCR) case. Get information about filing a modification case

at www. TexasLawHelp.org.
