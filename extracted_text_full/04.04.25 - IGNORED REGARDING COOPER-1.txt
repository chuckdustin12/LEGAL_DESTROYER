Hello,
Opposing counsel informed me she would be presenting a motion to consolidate today to the 322nd.
I wanted to inform the court that this has not been set in accordance with the rules, is premature, and is essentially being
attempted EX-PARTE without following proper procedure.
Any attempt to present today given these circumstances is inappropriate.
Additionally, I'd like to request the next available setting the court has to set the DWOP motion and have CC'ed Opposing
counsel here so she may give input as to her availability.
Thank you,
Charles Dustin Myers
