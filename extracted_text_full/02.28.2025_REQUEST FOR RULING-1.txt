INTRODUCTION
1. Movant respectfully submits this formal request for immediate rulings on multiple
pending motions and matters in the above-captioned case. These matters have been fully 
submitted and have languished without action well beyond any reasonable timeframe. Each 
delay is causing significant prejudice to Movant’s rights. Texas law makes clear that a court has a 
duty to rule on properly filed motions within a reasonable time, and that justice delayed is justice 
denied.

I. INTRODUCTION

1. Movant respectfully submits this formal request for immediate rulings on multiple
pending motions and matters in the above-captioned case. These matters have been fully
submitted and have languished without action well beyond any reasonable timeframe. Each
delay is causing significant prejudice to Movant’s rights. Texas law makes clear that a court has a

denied.

2. Ex Parte Emergency Motion for Contempt, Sanctions, Access to Residence, and
Custody filed 02/10/2025. This motion was filed ex parte over two weeks ago, alleging 
immediate harm and requesting urgent relief (enforcement of court orders via contempt, 
restoration of access to the marital residence, and emergency custody orders). Despite the 
emergency nature of this motion, no hearing has been set and no ruling or temporary order has 
issued to date. The lack of action has left Movant without access to the home and children, and 
the other party’s alleged contemptuous conduct (violating prior court orders, fraud, negligence) 
remains unaddressed, to the detriment of the children’s welfare and Movant’s rights. Opposing 
counsel was served a copy of this motion and has chosen not to reply or argue against the relief 
sought.  
3. Unopposed Motion for Summary Judgment (Filed on February 26, 2024). Sitting on
the docket now for over a year, the opposing party failed to file any response or opposing 
evidence by the deadline. Thus, the motion is unopposed and the material facts presented are 
undisputed. Despite the passage of the hearing/submission date and the absence of any 
contest, the Court has not ruled on the motion. The case cannot progress to final resolution 
even though no genuine fact issues exist, due to the absence of a ruling. 
4. Unanswered Requests for Admissions (Served on 09/17/2024) and Motion to Compel
Discovery filed 11/15/2024. The opposing party did not answer or produce the requested 
discovery by the due date, greatly hampering Movant’s ability to prepare this case. Movant filed 
a Motion to Compel on [date], seeking an order forcing compliance with the overdue discovery 
and appropriate sanctions. To date, the Court has neither set a hearing nor ruled on the 
motion to compel. The discovery period continues to elapse (or may have closed) without

Movant receiving the basic information needed, and without the Court enforcing the rules. The 
lack of a ruling effectively rewards the other party’s non-compliance and prejudices Movant. 
II. LEGAL ANALYSIS
5. It is well-settled under Texas law that a trial court has a duty to consider and rule on
motions that have been properly filed and brought to its attention. Once a motion is properly 
filed and pending, “the trial court’s act of considering the motion and ruling on it is ministerial”, 
not discretionary. See Eli Lilly &Co. v. Marshall, 829 S.W.2d 157, 158 (Tex. 1992) (orig. 
proceeding) (per curiam). 
6. Texas Supreme Court has held that a trial court abuses its discretion and may be
mandamused if it fails or refuses to rule on a pending motion within a reasonable time after a 
proper request. See O'Connor v. First Court of Appeals,  837 S.W.2d 94, 97 (Tex. 1992) (orig. 
proceeding). 
7. This is a formal request to the court by Movant to issue a ruling on the above
mentioned motions. In Eli Lilly & Co. v. Marshall, the Supreme Court made clear that a court 
can be compelled by mandamus to issue a ruling when it fails to do so in a timely manner. Id. 
8. What constitutes a “reasonable time” depends on the circumstances of the case,
however. However, when delays are extreme or unjustified, courts have not hesitated to find a 
denial of justice. For example, the Corpus Christi Court of Appeals recently granted mandamus 
relief against a trial judge who waited three years to rule on pending summary judgment 
motions, calling the delay “clearly” unreasonable.  In re America First Lloyd’s Insurance 
Company (No. 13-24-00059-CV; February 22, 2024).

III. ARGUMENT
9. In the present case, each of the pending matters has been left unresolved beyond any
reasonable time: 
i. The ex parte emergency motion has been pending for over two weeks with no
action, despite its urgent subject matter. In context, a two-week delay for an 
emergency child custody/home access issue is extraordinary – far more delay than 
is reasonable when immediate relief was requested and when no opposition has 
been filed. 
ii. The summary judgment motion has been ripe and unopposed since
02/26/2024. Given that no opposition was filed, there is no reason for prolonged 
advisement – the motion could have been decided promptly after the submission 
date. 
iii. The unanswered admissions were automatically admitted by rule 30 days
after service. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 198.2. Thus, they eliminated any factual dispute 
on those points as of that date. No further delay is needed or justified regarding 
matters that the rules deem conclusively established. 
iv. The motion to compel discovery has been awaiting a decision effectively
permitting the opposing party to remain silent while damage accrues. 
v. The Rule 91a motion to dismiss has a built-in 45-day decision deadline which,
given the failure of the opposing side to reply thus far in the case, this deadline 
will not be met, and the case will need to be dismissed outright as a matter of law.

IV. CONCLUSION
10. Because these delays have become unreasonable, the Court’s duty to issue prompt
rulings is invoked. Movant has taken appropriate steps to alert the Court of the need for action 
(via filings, communications, and this Request) in compliance with the procedure outlined in 
cases like In re Dong Sheng Huang, 491 S.W.3d 383, 385 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2016, 
orig. proc.) (simply filing a motion may not be enough; the party must set it for hearing or 
otherwise ensure the judge is aware of it) 
11. This Request itself is a formal call to action. There can be no doubt that these matters
are now squarely before the Court and awaiting immediate disposition. 
V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF AND JUDGEMENT
WHEREFORE, Movant, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, respectfully requests the follow relief 
from the court: 
1. Enter an order ruling on the Ex Parte Motion for Contempt, Sanctions, Access to
House at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148,  and Custody orders naming
Movant the primary conservator immediately. Movant asks that the Court grant
the requested relief in that motion (order the prompt return of the children to
Movant’s custody as requested, grant Movant immediate access to the residence, and
set the enforcement (contempt) issues for hearing or otherwise enforce them).
2. Rule on Movant’s Motion for Summary Judgment without further delay. Movant
requests that the Court GRANT the motion, given that it is unopposed and supported
by competent evidence (including deemed admissions), and enter a summary
judgment in Movant’s favor on the claims at issue. If the Court for any reason

V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF AND JUDGEMENT

WHEREFORE, Movant, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, respectfully requests the follow relief

from the court:

1. Enter an order ruling on the Ex Parte Motion for Contempt, Sanctions, Access to
House at ee, and Custody orders naming
Movant the primary conservator immediately. Movant asks that the Court grant
the requested relief in that motion (order the prompt return of the children to
Movant’s custody as requested, grant Movant immediate access to the residence, and
set the enforcement (contempt) issues for hearing or otherwise enforce them).

2. Rule on Movant’s Motion for Summary Judgment without further delay. Movant
requests that the Court GRANT the motion, given that it is unopposed and supported
by competent evidence (including deemed admissions), and enter a summary

judgment in Movant’s favor on the claims at issue. If the Court for any reason

declines to grant it, Movant requests an order denying the motion now, so that 
Movant may pursue appropriate next appellate steps. 
3. Deemed Admissions – Issue an order confirming that the Requests for Admissions 
served on 09/17/2024 are deemed admitted by the opposing party pursuant to Tex. 
R. Civ. P. 198.2(c) 
4. Movant requests that the Court deem each matter admitted (to the extent a formal 
order is deemed necessary) and acknowledge that those admissions are conclusively 
established for purposes of this case. 
5. Movant also prays for such other and further relief to which Movant may be justly 
entitled, at law or in equity, including any orders necessary to effectuate the prompt 
handling of these matters and to protect Movant’s rights. Movant emphasizes that 
time is of the essence. The Texas Constitution guarantees that our courts shall be 
open and that litigants shall have remedy by due course of law without unreasonable 
delay. Movant simply asks that this Court uphold that guarantee by administering 
prompt justice in this case and removing the cloud of uncertainty caused by the 
outstanding motions.
