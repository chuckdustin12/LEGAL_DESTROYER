IN THE 322nd DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
TO THE HONORABLE COURT: 
Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, respectfully submits this statement to the 
Court, acknowledging first the gravity and complexity inherent in adjudicating matters of Family 
Law. The Respondent's numerous pleadings, motions, notices, objections, and carefully prepared 
exhibits submitted to this Court were borne not out of defiance, but rather from profound respect 
for this judicial process and a dedicated attempt to bridge the pro-se divide thrust upon him. 
Every zealous effort undertaken by the Respondent has been guided by a simple, 
undeniable reality: the well-being and best interests of two minor children. The Respondent 
urges the Court to momentarily step into the shoes of these children, who, at the end of each 
school day, exit their classrooms only to find neither parent awaiting their arrival to guide them 
safely home. Once home, they find no father present to assist them with homework, to engage 
them in play, or simply to inquire about their day and ensure their academic and emotional needs 
are met. 
Instead, these children must rely on their great-grandparents or their aunt for daily care—
arrangements that, while filled with love, impose upon their caregivers’ responsibilities that 
disrupt the natural grandparental dynamic and strain family resources and roles unnecessarily. 
This very scenario was expressly outlined in the Respondent's initial pleading to the Court, 
highlighting a profound shift away from the stable, nurturing environment the children 
previously enjoyed. EXHIBIT 1

upon the human dimension of every case. The emotional appeal here is not frivolous, but rather a

CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, RESPONDENT’S STATEMENT

Respondent.

2025-03-31

TO THE HONORABLE COURT:

Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, respectfully submits this statement to the
Court, acknowledging first the gravity and complexity inherent in adjudicating matters of Family
Law. The Respondent's numerous pleadings, motions, notices, objections, and carefully prepared
exhibits submitted to this Court were borne not out of defiance, but rather from profound respect
for this judicial process and a dedicated attempt to bridge the pro-se divide thrust upon him.

Every zealous effort undertaken by the Respondent has been guided by a simple,
undeniable reality: the well-being and best interests of two minor children. The Respondent
urges the Court to momentarily step into the shoes of these children, who, at the end of each
school day, exit their classrooms only to find neither parent awaiting their arrival to guide them
safely home. Once home, they find no father present to assist them with homework, to engage
them in play, or simply to inquire about their day and ensure their academic and emotional needs
are met.

Instead, these children must rely on their great-grandparents or their aunt for daily care—
arrangements that, while filled with love, impose upon their caregivers’ responsibilities that
disrupt the natural grandparental dynamic and strain family resources and roles unnecessarily.
This very scenario was expressly outlined in the Respondent's initial pleading to the Court,
highlighting a profound shift away from the stable, nurturing environment the children
previously enjoyed. EXHIBIT |

genuine representation of the stark contrast between the children's former stable environment and 
the instability they currently endure. Respondent's advocacy, although passionate, has been 
meticulously crafted to illustrate clearly that alternatives exist which restore this stability without 
risk of harm or endangerment. The driving force behind the current situation is not a legitimate 
threat of harm but rather fear of accountability by the Petitioner. 
The Respondent's zealousness, potentially misinterpreted as contemptuous, is instead a 
testament to his unwavering commitment to the well-being of his children. Restoring their previous 
status quo is essential for their educational, emotional, and developmental stability. If necessary, 
the Respondent stands ready to demonstrate his accountability through daily status reports or any 
other means this Court deems appropriate, confident that the Court will observe a swift and 
meaningful recovery in both the children's and Respondent’s lives, socially, emotionally, and 
financially. 
To the Petitioner, this resolution poses no disproportionate detriment. The Respondent 
harbors no animosity toward her, has never inflicted harm upon her or their children, and has 
consistently prioritized their collective welfare. 
Ultimately, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, the litigator, arose from the necessity faced by 
CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, the father and individual unjustly characterized from the outset as 
a criminal, an abuser, and a threat. Fully aware of the uphill battle inherent in self-representation, 
he chose this path not merely for himself, but expressly for the sake of his children and the 
preservation of their right to familial stability and emotional well-being, which is at risk each day. 
In closing, Respondent respectfully recalls his initial pleading to this Court, wherein he 
proposed a comprehensive parenting plan designed specifically to preempt precisely the instability 
and emotional distress that has now come to pass. Had this proactive and well-reasoned parenting 
plan been enacted from the outset, the turmoil now confronting this Court and this family could 
have been avoided, but it remains unopposed. Respondent renews his plea for the Court to revisit 
and adopt this original proposal, thereby safeguarding the well-being of the children, restoring 
familial harmony, and reaffirming the fundamental objectives and compassionate foundations of 
Family Law. 
Respectfully submitted,
