MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS,

Respondent.

TO THE COURT:

Petitioner, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, brings forward this notice to the court, and

respectfully shows the following:
I. STATEMENT OF FACTS

1. On March 19, 2025, Petitioner opened a separate SAPCR suit in this court to escape
procedural abandonment from the 322" district court and lack of prosecution from the opposing
counsel and a cover letter explaining why the suit was properly before the court.

2. On March 20, 2025, Respondent answered this suit in a pleading filed by a non-party,
RODERICK D. MARX.

3. Subsequently, Respondent, through RODERICK D. MARX, a non party, filed a
MOTION TO CONSOLIDATE on March 20, 2025.

4. On March 20, 2025, Petitioner filed a MOTION TO STRIKE RESPONDENT’S
ANSWER AND MOTION TO CONSOLIDATE.

5. On March 21, 2025, Petitioner filed a verified motion challenging COOPER L.
CARTER’S authority to represent the Respondent in this matter.

6. On March 24, 2025, COOPER L. CARTER reached out to the court coordinator for the

=== PAGE 2 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
233rd, and stated “Could you please provide dates and times that the Court is available to hear my 
motion?”. 
 
7. On March 24, 2025, the court coordinator, a non-lawyer, provided responded with 
“[t]he Motion to Consolidate just needs to be filed in the 322nd Divorce case and sent to their 
Judge to sign; no hearing necessary, it’s a mandatory consolidation. 
 
8. On March 25, 2025, Petitioner filed an EMERGENCY EX-PARTE TRO for the safety 
and welfare of the minor children named in this suit. 
 
8. On March 27, 2025, Petitioner reached out to the coordinator and informed the court 
he intended to present the TRO to the court on March 28, 2025, at 9:00 A.M. 
 
9. Later that evening, without contacting the Petitioner, the opposing counsel reached out 
and mentioned a forward consolidation motion that would be filed at a alter date, and requested 
to be “patched in” to the judge during the presentation of the TRO despite not providing any 
written response. 
 
10. On March 28, 2025, Petitioner got ready, drove to court, paid for parking, met with 
the coordinator, contacted opposing counsel, and everyone agreed to set the TRO for a full 
hearing on April 10, 2025, and Petitioner went before the Associate Judge to have his emergency 
motion heard. 
 
11. Prior to being called up to present, the Associate Judge left the room, and came back 
and declined to hear the emergency TRO outright.

7. On March 24, 2025, the court coordinator, a non-lawyer, provided responded with
“Tt]he Motion to Consolidate just needs to be filed in the 322™ Divorce case and sent to their

Judge to sign; no hearing necessary, it’s a mandatory consolidation.

12. The reason provided was that “the consolidation motion was filed in the wrong court” 
and that a forward-looking consolidation motion warranted outright refusal of the emergency 
TRO before her. 
 
13. The referenced consolidation motion was not filed until April 3, 2025, in the 322nd 
District Court of Tarrant County, and COOPER L. CARTER’S availability suddenly dried up, as 
she earliest possible date to hear the motion filed in the 322nd was April 24th despite just telling 
this court she could hear the TRO on April 10th, 2025. 
 
14. This unnecessary delay in the face of an emergency is the exact reason why Petitioner 
opened the SAPCR, and notified this court of his intention to file a PETITION FOR WRIT OF 
MANDAMUS in the second court of appeals. 
 
15. On April 8, 2025, prior to the submission of his MANDAMUS, the Petitioner reached 
out to the court coordinator of this court, and explained that he would be filing Mandamus, and 
he wanted to ensure that the District Judge of the 233rd was made aware of the situation out of 
procedural fairness and transparency. 
 
16. The coordinator replied with “I’m sorry, I cannot help you.  Per Judge Stone this 
matter is to be taken up with the 322nd.” 
 
17. Two days later, without any notice to the parties, without any hearing set, without 
addressing the objection on file, and before transferring the case, the District Judge of this court 
signed and filed an order titled ORDER ON MOTION TO CONSOLIDATE. 
 
18. The court has shown it has the ability to act on its’ own accord, but intentionally 
chose the path of most resistance.

19. The court is misapplying the law in several areas and is blatantly violating due 
process in the face of an emergency. 
 
20. Furthermore, the court is causing undue delay and prejudice to the Petitioner and is 
denying him equal protection under the U.S. Constitution by refusing to allow him to submit 
exhibits, granting orders sua sponte without his input or without a scheduled hearing, and is now 
actively rubber-stamping boilerplate orders without any logical basis. 
 
21. This information will be supplemented into the Petitioner’s PETITION FOR WRIT 
OF MANDAMUS, as the court’s collective actions with the opposing counsel and recent 
erroneous order showcase a clear attempt to thwart the Mandamus proceedings, deprive the 
Petitioner of an ability to accurately make a record, and disregard Texas law at the most 
fundamental level. 
LEGAL ANALYSIS 
Lack of Notice and Hearing 
1. A Texas district court’s sua sponte consolidation of cases without notice or a hearing 
offends fundamental due process and violates Texas procedure. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 
21(b) mandates that any motion and “notice of any court proceeding…must be served upon all 
other parties not less than three days before the time specified for the court proceeding”. This 
rule exists to ensure each party has an opportunity to be heard and to prepare objections. 
2. Consolidating two family law cases without giving the parties notice or a chance to be 
heard flouts this requirement and thus constitutes an abuse of discretion. The Texas Supreme 
Court recognizes that “[f]ailure to give notice violates ‘the most rudimentary demands of due 
process” Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545, 550, 85 S.Ct. 1187, 14 L.Ed.2d 62 (1965)). While a

lack of notice or hearing may not automatically render an order void, it does render it voidable as 
a due process violation. In short, entering a consolidation order on its own motion, without any 
party setting the matter for submission or hearing, deprives the objecting party of the fair process 
guaranteed by Rule 21 and the Fourteenth Amendment. 
3. The judge’s failure to hold a hearing here is especially egregious because Petitioner 
had filed a written objection in this court, and a pre-objection in the 322nd district court, putting 
both courts on notice that consolidation was contested. 
B. Ignoring the Written Objection 
 
4. Consolidating in the face of a pending written objection – without addressing or 
formally overruling that objection – is contrary to Texas procedure and due process. Texas Rule 
of Civil Procedure 174 authorizes consolidation only “[w]hen actions involving a common 
question of law or fact are pending before the court” and anticipates that the court will exercise 
“sound and legal discretion” to avoid prejudice to the parties.  
 
5. Here, the objector squarely raised their opposition in writing, yet the court neither held 
a hearing nor entered any ruling on the objection before ordering consolidation. In analogous 
contexts, the Texas Supreme Court has insisted that a trial court must not proceed to decide a 
matter while an objection or lack of consent is known and unresolved. For example, in 
Burnaman v. Heaton, the high court held it improper for a court to sign an agreed judgment when 
it knows a party has withdrawn consent; “consent must exist at the very moment the court 
undertakes to make the agreement the judgment of the court”.  
6. When a trial judge is aware that one party does not consent or objects, the judge should 
refuse to approve the proposed action without hearing the party’s challenge. By analogy, the

treating the motion as if unopposed. This undermines the purpose of Rule 174, which is to 
promote convenience without unfairly prejudicing a party’s rights. 
7. Ignoring a live objection also violates basic due process, as it denied the objecting 
party any forum to argue why consolidation was improper (for example, due to dominant 
jurisdiction or prejudice). In sum, issuing the order without addressing the objection was a clear 
abuse of discretion. At minimum, the consolidation order is voidable for lack of due process and 
should be vacated upon a proper challenge. If the objection went entirely unheard, the order’s 
validity is highly suspect under Burnaman’s mandate of a party’s right to be heard before an 
adverse order. Id. 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 (Tex. 1951). Here, that is what happened. 
C. No Transfer of Venue 
 
8. The situation is compounded if the two suits were in different courts and the judge 
consolidated “without first transferring venue from the newer court to the older case.” 
Under Texas law, when two courts have concurrent jurisdiction over related SAPCR or family 
law matters, the first-filed case enjoys “dominant jurisdiction”. The Texas Supreme Court’s 
seminal decision in Curtis v. Gibbs instructs that “Any subsequent suit involving the same 
parties and the same controversy must be dismissed if a party to that suit calls it to the court’s 
attention.” Id. 511 S.W.2d 263 (1974). 
 
9. Texas Family Code §155.201 (the continuing exclusive jurisdiction statute) requires 
that when a SAPCR is pending in one court and a new proceeding concerning the child is filed in 
another court, the second action must be transferred to the court with continuing jurisdiction. In 
fact, transfer is a necessary condition precedent to consolidation in such situations. See In the 
Interest of J.V.O. and J.R.O. III., No. 04-20-00346-CV (Tex. App. – San Antonio, 2021). The 
Fourth Court of Appeals recently emphasized that a motion to “consolidate” an earlier SAPCR

Fourth Court of Appeals recently emphasized that a motion to “consolidate” an earlier SAPCR

with a later divorce implied a mandatory transfer; while labeled a consolidation, it 
“accomplished the same purpose” as a transfer, and the judge signing the order was effectively 
acting on behalf of the SAPCR court to effect the required transfer. Id.  
 
10. By contrast, in our case no such transfer order or exchange of benches occurred. The 
newer case was never properly vested in the court that assumed control. A judge cannot 
unilaterally reach out and seize a case from another court’s docket without a statutory transfer. 
Thus, to the extent the consolidation order was entered without a valid transfer of venue or 
jurisdiction, it is void (not merely voidable) for want of subject-matter jurisdiction over the 
second case. An order entered without jurisdiction “had no effect” and can be attacked at any 
time.  
11. Even when the cases were in the same county, such as here, local practice requires a 
motion to transfer and consolidate be filed in the earliest case and heard by that court. Here, the 
judge consolidated into the older case sua sponte without the new case ever being properly 
transferred. This end-run around the usual venue transfer process is inconsistent with Curtis v. 
Gibbs and Texas’s dominant-jurisdiction doctrine. It suggests the consolidation order is 
procedurally invalid and should be treated as a nullity. 
Void or Voidable? 
 
12. Given the above defects, one must determine whether the consolidation order is void 
ab initio or merely voidable (subject to reversal upon direct attack). Under Texas law, an order is 
void if the court lacked jurisdiction or capacity to act, whereas an order issued in violation of 
procedural requirements (but within the court’s jurisdiction) is typically voidable. Travelers Ins.

13. In this case, the consolidation was accomplished through serious procedural 
irregularities: no notice, no hearing, ignoring a filed objection, and, critically, no proper transfer 
of the case between courts. The strongest argument for treating the order as void is the lack of 
jurisdictional authority to consolidate without a transfer. Because the newer SAPCR was never 
formally transferred, the judge who consolidated may have had no power over that case or the 
subject matter – a jurisdictional flaw rendering the order void. 
 
14. On the other hand, to the extent the court did have subject-matter jurisdiction, such as 
here, the consolidation order’s other defects of no notice, hearing, or considering the objection, 
would make it voidable for abuse of discretion, but not absolutely void. Even then, Texas courts 
have held that proceeding without the required notice or hearing is a due process violation 
warranting reversal.  
 
15. In either event, the order cannot stand. If void, it can be attacked anytime (even 
collaterally); if voidable, it must be set aside through direct appellate relief. Here, the Petitioner 
has promptly sought relief, so whether labeled void or voidable, the improper consolidation 
should be vacated. Notably, the order’s timing—issued while a mandamus was pending on the 
TRO—further indicates it was a mechanism of expediency rather than a valid judicial act, 
reinforcing that it should carry no legal force. 
Conflict with Texas Supreme Court Precedent 
 
16. By consolidating the newer action into the older one on its own motion – rather than 
dismissing or abating it – the trial judge here achieved the opposite of Curtis: instead of 
eliminating the conflict, the judge effectively absorbed the second suit without following the 
safeguards (notice, transfer order, etc.) that Curtis and its sister cases require. The consolidation

justice and prevent “unseemly conflict” between courts. Most egregious, is the court continues to 
incorrectly apply the law in the face of an emergency. 
Effect on the Pending Mandamus 
 
17. Finally, Petitioner addresses whether the trial court’s consolidation gambit – executed 
while a mandamus proceeding is pending involving the very TRO the consolidation moots 
succeeded in depriving the appellate court of jurisdiction.  
18. It did not. A party cannot, by procedural manipulation, divest the Court of Appeals of 
its power to review a serious abuse of discretion. Even if the consolidation order is merely 
voidable, equity and public policy counsel against treating the mandamus as moot. Texas 
appellate courts have recognized that they may proceed to decide an issue that is “technically” 
moot when the surrounding circumstances indicate manipulation or when the underlying 
problem is capable of repetition yet evading review. Here, the timing and method of the 
consolidation suggest it was done for the express purpose of “mooting” the mandamus complaint 
about the TRO. Courts disfavor such tactics. As Chief Justice Hecht has observed, mandamus 
relief acts on a judge’s conduct, not merely on the existence of an order: “Unlike remedies 
granted by appeal, a mandamus writ is not an action on an order or judgment but is instead an 
order against the respondent to correct a clear abuse of discretion.” In other words, the appellate 
court’s mandamus jurisdiction is “original, not derivative of the trial court’s order”, and 
cannot be defeated by the trial court attempting to obscure jurisdiction. 
19. Allowing the consolidation to moot the mandamus would reward the very procedural 
trickery that the appellate process is designed to check. The Second Court of Appeals should 
therefore retain jurisdiction to review the TRO issue (and the consolidation order itself, if 
necessary) despite the trial court’s attempt to merge the cases. Texas law is clear that a trial court

trickery that the appellate process is designed to check. The Second Court of Appeals should
therefore retain jurisdiction to review the TRO issue (and the consolidation order itself, if

necessary) despite the trial court’s attempt to merge the cases. Texas law is clear that a trial court

cannot evade appellate review by unilateral actions. For example, in Curtis v. Gibbs the 
Supreme Court granted mandamus to undo conflicting orders, ensuring the first court’s orders 
(like a TRO or injunction) were subject to proper review. 
20. Likewise here, the consolidation that “mooted” the TRO is itself fatally flawed, and 
the appellate court may address that defect. The appellate court can either: (1) disregard the 
consolidation as void and decide the mandamus on its merits, or (2) treat the mandamus petition 
as also encompassing a challenge to the consolidation (given that it occurred post-filing) and 
grant relief restoring the cases to their prior posture. Either route prevents a miscarriage of 
justice. The key point is that the Court of Appeals’ mandamus power persists in the face of 
these procedural anomalies. A party’s right to appellate review of a void/voidable order cannot be 
defeated by the trial judge’s self-help remedy of consolidation. If it were otherwise, a trial court 
could always attempt to moot pending appeals or mandamus actions by hurriedly altering the 
status quo – a result no appellate court should countenance. 
Conclusion 
In sum, a sua sponte consolidation under these circumstances is rife with legal error. It 
violated the notice and hearing requirements of Rule 21, ignored a pending objection (in 
derogation of due process and Burnaman), defied the dominant-jurisdiction rule (Curtis v. Gibbs) 
by bypassing a required transfer, and appears calculated to evade appellate oversight. Such an 
order is invalid – void if viewed as a jurisdictional transgression, or at least voidable as an abuse 
of discretion – and it cannot extinguish the appellate court’s authority to review the underlying 
TRO and the consolidation itself. The Second Court of Appeals should grant relief to undo the 
improper consolidation, refuse to dismiss the mandamus as moot, and ensure that Relator’s 
objections are heard in an orderly, lawful proceeding. This not only vindicates Relator’s due

process rights but also upholds the integrity of Texas’s procedural rules and precedent in family 
law cases. 
 
When combined in concert with the actions of the opposing counsel in this matter, it is 
clear that the court and counsel’s intent was to stall the father’s case and continue denying 
him access to his children and residence without a legal basis, which is harassment via legal 
process. Courts have sanctioned attorneys for less egregious tactics when they primarily serve to 
impede an adversary’s lawful claims (In re Bennett, 960 S.W.2d 35, 40 (Tex. 1997) (orig. 
proceeding) – recognizing that abuse of the judicial process can warrant sanctions). Here, 
opposing counsel’s consolidation gambit appears to cross into that territory, and the court not 
only enabled it, but is actively supporting it. 
 
Petitioner asks this court to re-think the manner in which it is choosing to handle this 
matter. His self-represented status does not authorize this court, or any other court, to ignore the 
best interests of the children in the face of an un-disputed, un-opposed, and now un-adjudicated 
emergency. This court is allowing legal advice to be given from a court coordinator which is the 
foundation for this mess that has been created given COOPER L. CARTER’S incompetence and 
lack of skill necessary to handle such a case. The court has a duty to administer justice, and here, 
that has wholly failed in all aspects. All information related to this pleading will be supplemented 
into the Mandamus record given the court’s unjustified refusal to permit exhibits to be filed.
