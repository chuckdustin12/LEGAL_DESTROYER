COVER LETTER – EVIDENCE FOR WATAUGA POLICE DEPARTMENT 
To the Reviewing Officer, 
Thank you for your time in this matter, as all other remedies have been exhausted prior to 
this request from the department. Attached to this document are relevant materials related 
to the fraudulent documents that were prepared and presented to the 322nd District Court 
of Tarrant County on December 18, 2023, which led to my unjust removal from my 
residence on January 16, 2024, prior to any notice or any hearing occurring. 
These items were prepared in part by an individual not named in the case—Daniel Kenneth 
Branthoover—who resides in Yukon, Oklahoma. I have contacted the police department in 
that jurisdiction to provide the same materials that have been provided here. 
Over the weekend of December 15, 2023, Morgan Michelle Myers, the Petitioner in this 
matter, traveled across state lines to Yukon, Oklahoma, where she received help from 
Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, her stepfather, in preparing attachments #1, #2, and #3, 
which are: 
1. The Original Petition for Divorce 
2. A Statement of Inability to Afford Court Costs 
3. An Application for Protective Order 
This individual facilitated the transfer of $1,546 out of our joint marital bank account on 
December 15, 2023, and it appears as being sent to “dmb575”, which is Mr. Branthoover’s 
PayPal account. He facilitated this transaction to help conceal her bank account 
information. Both Mr. Branthoover and Morgan have admitted via text messages that they 
transferred $1,546 to Morgan and then proceeded to ﬁle for divorce four days later 
(December 18, 2023), claiming indigency under penalty of perjury. 
The Statement of Inability to Afford Court Costs falsely claims that her monthly expenses 
exceed her monthly net pay and that she had no access to ﬁnancial resources. She also 
misrepresented separate property that she owned, such as the car payments that I have 
been burdened with. Furthermore, in the Original Petition for Divorce, she knowingly 
claimed to have an active order of protection against me, which was false. 
After these fraudulent ﬁlings resulted in my wrongful removal from my home on January 16, 
2024, it is important to note that this occurred on a day when the Tarrant County courts 
were officially closed due to inclement weather (as publicly announced on their official 
Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/people/Tarrant-County-District-
Courts/100092554647052/).

Evidence Provided: 
To support my claims, I am submitting the following evidence: 
1. Court Filings & Fraudulent Orders – Copies of the divorce petition, protective order 
application, and Statement of Inability to Afford Court Costs, all of which contain 
demonstrable falsehoods. 
2. Financial Statements & Transaction Records – Bank records showing the December 
15, 2023 PayPal transfer of $1,546 from our joint account to Mr. Branthoover’s 
account, contradicting Petitioner’s indigency claim. 
3. Text Message Exchanges – Messages proving that both Morgan Michelle Myers and 
Daniel Kenneth Branthoover coordinated this ﬁnancial transfer and subsequent 
fraudulent ﬁlings. 
4. The illegal lockout notice left on the door on March 6, 2024. 
5. Evidence of my personal belongings from the home being disposed of despite the 
orders in place (albeit fraudulent) preventing such actions. 
6. The Associate Judge’s Report signed on February 1st, which had speciﬁc 
requirements for formal temporary orders to be reduced – one of which was that 
they had to have been prepared by my prior attorney, who was terminated, and 
whose signature is also missing, and the other was within a 20-day time period – 
which was also not adhered to. 
7. The current orders which differ signiﬁcantly from the associate judge’s report, claim 
I consent to them despite my signature not being present, and which reference a 
hearing that never occurred. 
Request for Assistance: 
Given the overwhelming evidence that my removal was based on fraudulent and 
procedurally invalid orders, I respectfully request that the Watauga Police Department take 
the following actions: 
1. Acknowledge my legal right to return to my residence, as the court orders removing 
me were obtained through fraud and due process violations. 
2. Investigate the fraudulent ﬁlings made by Petitioner and the involvement of Daniel 
Kenneth Branthoover in facilitating perjury and ﬁnancial deception. 
3. Prevent Petitioner from falsely claiming trespassing if I return to the residence, as 
she obtained the house through fraudulent court orders.

Evidence Provided:

To support my claims, | am submitting the following evidence:

1.

Court Filings & Fraudulent Orders — Copies of the divorce petition, protective order
application, and Statement of Inability to Afford Court Costs, all of which contain
demonstrable falsehoods.

Financial Statements & Transaction Records — Bank records showing the December
15, 2023 PayPal transfer of $1,546 from our joint account to Mr. Branthoover’s
account, contradicting Petitioner’s indigency claim.

Text Message Exchanges — Messages proving that both Morgan Michelle Myers and
Daniel Kenneth Branthoover coordinated this financial transfer and subsequent
fraudulent filings.

The illegal lockout notice left on the door on March 6, 2024.

Evidence of my personal belongings from the home being disposed of despite the
orders in place (albeit fraudulent) preventing such actions.

The Associate Judge’s Report signed on February 1*, which had specific
requirements for formal temporary orders to be reduced — one of which was that
they had to have been prepared by my prior attorney, who was terminated, and
whose signature is also missing, and the other was within a 20-day time period —
which was also not adhered to.

The current orders which differ significantly from the associate judge’s report, claim
| consent to them despite my signature not being present, and which reference a
hearing that never occurred.

Request for Assistance:

Given the overwhelming evidence that my removal was based on fraudulent and

procedurally invalid orders, | respectfully request that the Watauga Police Department take

the following actions:

1.

Acknowledge my legal right to return to my residence, as the court orders removing
me were obtained through fraud and due process violations.

Investigate the fraudulent filings made by Petitioner and the involvement of Daniel

4. File an official report documenting this matter to preserve evidence for potential 
further legal action. 
Closing Statement: 
I appreciate the department’s time and effort in reviewing this evidence. I am committed to 
following the legal process but given that my removal was unlawful and based on 
fraudulent court ﬁlings, I ask for the Watauga Police Department’s immediate intervention 
in ensuring that my rights are protected. 
Please feel free to contact me if you require any additional documentation or testimony. I 
am willing to cooperate fully with law enforcement to ensure that justice is served and my 
children’s well-being are protected. 
The necessity of this request is more so about the children, who are now being medically 
neglected, cared for by third parties, the eldest is struggling in school, and due to the 
signiﬁcant damages that have occurred from being unable to work from out of the home 
which has directly impacted their ﬁnancial livelihood. 
The motive for all of this was an attempt by my wife to cover-up an affair that took place 
between October 2022 and the present day. 
 
Sincerely, 
Charles Dustin Myers
