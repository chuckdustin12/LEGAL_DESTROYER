Statement of the Case 
Nature of Underlying Proceeding: This original proceeding arises from a Suit 
Affecting the Parent-Child Relationship ("SAPCR") involving two minor children, 
M.E.M. and C.R.M., in which Relator filed an emergency ex parte application for 
temporary restraining order ("TRO") in the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County, 
Texas. The underlying SAPCR (Cause No. 233-765358-25) was a new proceeding 
initiated by Relator on March 19, 2025, and was answered on March 20, 2025. 
There is a related divorce matter (322-744263-23) that has not been prosecuted 
since April 24, 2024, and no final orders have been rendered. Relator seeks 
declaratory and injunctive relief preventing the Real Party in Interest from barring 
Relator’s from accessing his home, business, and children until valid orders are 
rendered that reflect the children’s best interests. 
Respondent Judge: The Respondent Judge, Kate Stone, is the presiding Associate 
Judge of the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County, Texas. Her office is located at 
200 E. Weatherford St. 5th Floor Fort Worth, TX 76196-0227. 
Respondent’s Challenged Actions and inaction: The trial court refused to hear 
an emergency motion before it on March 28, 2025, and used out-of-court 
statements made by the opposing counsel regarding a forward looking 
consolidation motion that would be filed at a later date, and denied to hear the 
motion after a full hearing date was agreed upon by both parties for April 10, 2025.

Issues Presented 
 
B. Are the March 14, 2024, temporary orders rendered by an Associate 
Judge void ab initio because they explicitly state that all parties agree to 
the terms of the order yet only contain the signatures of the opposing 
party and were never properly adopted by the referring court? 
 
C. Did the Respondent abuse her discretion by failing to perform a clear 
ministerial duty when she refused to consider and rule on Relator's 
properly filed ex parte emergency Application for TRO? 
 
D. Did the Respondent further abuse her discretion un-setting the matter for 
a hearing, and favoring a forward-looking consolidation motion as the 
grounds for denying to hear the emergency TRO before a transfer was 
filed? 
 
E. The Relator has been left without an adequate remedy for an appeal 
because no order resulted from the Respondent judge’s refusal to act on 
Relator’s emergency TRO. 
 
F. Did the Respondent clearly abuse her discretion by excluding any 
exhibits related to the emergency TRO?

ARGUMENT 
A. Mandamus Standard 
Mandamus relief is not merely appropriate but imperative in this case 
because the trial court's inaction and the continued enforcement of a void order 
constitute a clear abuse of discretion for which Relator has no adequate remedy at 
law. The Texas Supreme Court has consistently and unequivocally held that to 
obtain mandamus relief, a Relator must show (1) the trial court clearly abused its 
discretion or violated a duty imposed by law, and (2) there is no adequate remedy 
by appeal. In re Bass, 113 S.W.3d 735, 738 (Tex. 2003) (orig. proceeding); Walker 
v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 839 (Tex. 1992). 
Texas jurisprudence firmly establishes that mandamus will lie to correct a 
void order, even without a traditional showing of inadequate appellate remedy. As 
the Supreme Court of Texas definitively stated in Urbish v. 127th Judicial Dist. 
Court, 708 S.W.2d 429, 431 (Tex. 1986) (orig. proceeding), mandamus will issue 
to correct a void order, i.e., an order the trial court had no power or jurisdiction to 
render. The Court has further emphasized in In re Sw. Bell Tel. Co., 35 S.W.3d 602, 
605 (Tex. 2000) (orig. proceeding) that if an order is void, the Relator need not 
show he lacks an adequate appellate remedy, and mandamus relief is appropriate. 
This principle was recently reaffirmed in In re J.R., No. 02-21-00060-CV, 2021 
WL 1421440 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth Apr. 15, 2021, orig. proceeding), where the

court explicitly stated: "A trial court abuses its discretion if it enters a void order, 
and mandamus will issue to remedy the void order regardless of whether the relator 
has an adequate remedy by appeal." 
B. The temporary orders rendered on March 14, 2024, are void ab initio 
A fundamental and inviolable principle in Texas jurisprudence is that a 
judgment based on a settlement requires the consent of both parties at the time it is 
rendered by the court. The Texas Supreme Court's seminal decision in Burnaman v. 
Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 (1951) established the bedrock principle that a party 
is free to withdraw their consent to a settlement at any time before the judgment is 
rendered. The Court's language was unambiguous and leaves no room for 
interpretation: "A valid consent judgment cannot be rendered by a court when 
consent of one of the parties thereto is wanting. It is not sufficient that a party's 
consent may at one time have been given; consent must exist at the very moment 
the court undertakes to make the agreement the judgment of the court." Id. This 
principle has been consistently reaffirmed, as in Carter v. Carter, 535 S.W.2d 215 
(Tex. Civ. App. 1976), which emphasized that "the law seems to be clear that a 
consent judgment cannot be rendered by a trial court when consent of one of the 
parties is lacking, even though that consent may have been previously given." 
In the present case, the only orders rendered by any court were rendered as 
consent judgments but lack the signatures of all parties. The orders themselves

explicitly state "As evidenced by the signatures below, all parties agree to the terms

CONSENTED TO AS TO BOTH FORM AND SUBSTANCE" yet crucially lacks 
the signature of the Relator and his prior counsel. APP 2.38. The Court must 
recognize that the absence of the Relator’s signature is not a mere technical 
deficiency but a fatal jurisdictional flaw that renders the orders void ab initio. 
Because his signature was required to effectuate consent, and the orders themselves 
acknowledge this requirement, the orders are unquestionably void. 
C. Outright refusing to hear the emergency TRO is a clear abuse of discretion  
It is well-settled and beyond legitimate dispute that a trial court has a 
ministerial duty to consider and rule on motions that have been properly filed and 
brought to the court's attention. The Texas Court of Appeals has emphatically 
stated, "When a motion is properly filed and pending before the trial court, the act 
of giving consideration to and ruling upon that motion is a ministerial act, and 
mandamus may issue to compel the trial judge to act." Safety-Kleen Corp. v. 
Garcia, 945 S.W.2d 268, 269 (Tex. App.- San Antonio 1997, orig. proceeding). To 
establish an abuse of discretion for refusal to rule, the relator must show: (1) the 
trial court had a legal duty to perform a nondiscretionary act, (2) the relator 
requested performance of that act, and (3) the trial court failed or refused to do so.

In re Shredder Co., L.L.C., 225 S.W.3d 676, 679 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2006, orig. 
proceeding). 
Here, the Relator properly filed his emergency TRO application in the 233rd 
District Court, meticulously followed all procedural requirements, and appeared at 
the scheduled time to present at 9:00 A.M. on March 28, 2025. SUPP 2.11 The 
Court must recognize that the court's refusal to even consider the application—
based solely on an opposing counsel's unverified, informal representation about a 
future filing in another court—constitutes a clear and inexcusable failure to 
perform a ministerial duty – especially when no response or opposition to the TRO 
was filed by the opposing party and that same party was permitted to interfere with 
the proceedings without being present in the courtroom. SUPP 2.19 
The refusal is particularly troubling because 1) The TRO application 
involved un-opposed allegations of immediate harm to children, which courts are 
obligated to address promptly; 2) the refusal was due to a forward looking 
consolidation motion; 3) even if a motion to consolidate had been filed, it would 
not automatically divest the 233rd Court of jurisdiction until actually granted; and 
4) the proper procedure would have been a motion to transfer, not consolidation. 
See Tex. Fam. Code § 6.407. This misapplication of the law resulted in the refusal 
to hear a properly filed motion to favor a procedurally improper motion that hadn’t 
even been filed yet.

In In re Blakeney, 254 S.W.3d 659, 661 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2008, orig. 
proc.), the court held that mandamus is appropriate when a trial court refuses to 
rule on a properly filed motion and the relator has no adequate remedy by appeal. 
That is precisely the situation here. The 233rd Court's refusal to even consider 
Relator's emergency TRO application has left him with no forum to address his 
urgent concerns about the children's welfare, as the case before the 322nd has been 
procedurally abandoned and Relator has been seeking relief from facially void 
temporary orders to no avail since March 14, 2024, without any opposition from 
the opposing counsel. SUPP 3.2 
D. Improper consolidation does not justify the refusal to act 
The 233rd Court’s refusal to act was based on a fundamentally flawed legal 
premise: that the 322nd District Court had continuing exclusive jurisdiction over 
the children. Under Texas Family Code § 155.001, a court acquires continuing 
exclusive jurisdiction over children only when it renders a “final order” in a 
SAPCR. It is undisputed that the 322nd Court never rendered any final order 
regarding the children. Without a final order, the 322nd Court never acquired 
continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the children. Therefore, the 233rd Court 
was entirely within its authority to hear and rule on Relator’s emergency TRO 
application pursuant to § 155.001.

Moreover, even if the 322nd Court had continuing exclusive jurisdiction 
(which it does not), the proper procedure would have been a motion to transfer 
under the Family Code, not consolidation. Consolidation is appropriate for related 
cases within the same court, not for transferring jurisdiction between courts. By 
refusing to act based on an anticipated consolidation motion, the 233rd Court 
fundamentally misapplied the law, as consolidation cannot be effectuated prior to 
the transfer of the action. Tex. Fam. Code § 6.407. 
Rather, opposing counsel could have filed a plea in abatement but instead 
chose to Respond to the SAPCR after not prosecuting the divorce case since April 
24, 2024. 
E. Relator has been left with no adequate remedy by an appeal 
 
Because the 233rd District Court outright refused to hear the emergency 
TRO before it and the appearance before the court produced no order, the Relator 
has been left without an adequate remedy for an appeal. The Texas Supreme Court 
has recognized that mandamus relief is appropriate when "a party's ability to 
present a viable claim or defense is vitiated or severely compromised." In re 
Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 136 (Tex. 2004). That is precisely the 
situation here. The Relator has diligently sought relief in a one-sided case to no 
avail, and the 233rd SAPCR was opened to escape the abandoned divorce suit that 
hasn't been prosecuted since April 24th, 2024, and has no valid orders in effect.

avail, and the 233rd SAPCR was opened to escape the abandoned divorce suit that

hasn't been prosecuted since April 24th, 2024, and has no valid orders in effect.

F. Refusal to accept relevant exhibits central to the emergency TRO 
 
On April 9th, 2025, Relator attempted to file a NOTICE OF INCLUSION 
with the trial court, which included critical exhibits related to the emergency TRO. 
The Judge refused outright to permit Relator to include any exhibits related to the 
TRO in the rejection comments. SUPP 2.13, 2.16 When contacting the clerk's 
office, no substantive response was received from the court coordinator. The 
returned comment stated: "Judge’s request. Please resubmit without the attached 
exhibits" without citing any legal authority, statute, rule, or local procedure 
justifying this rejection. SUPP 1.1. 
This rejection by the clerk constitutes a clear violation of the Texas Rules of 
Civil Procedure. Rule 21(f)(11) states: "The clerk may not refuse to file a 
document that fails to conform with this rule." Instead, the rule provides that the 
clerk "may identify the error to be corrected and state a deadline for the party to 
resubmit the document in a conforming format." Here, the clerk provided no 
specific error to be corrected, and no legal basis for the rejection outside of “we are 
unable to accept any exhibits into the case”. SUPP 1.1 By doing so, the Relator has 
been deprived of essential privileges to make a record pursuant to Tex. Const Art. 
1, § 19. 
Moreover, Rule 59 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure states: “Notes, 
accounts, bonds, mortgages, records, and all other written instruments,

constituting, in whole or in part, the claim sued on, or the matter set up in defense, 
may be made a part of the pleadings by copies thereof, or the originals, being 
attached or filed and referred to as such, or by copying the same in the body of the 
pleading in aid and explanation of the allegations in the petition or answer made in 
reference to said instruments and shall be deemed a part thereof for all purposes.” 
The request to remove the exhibits specifically for the emergency TRO without 
any statutory backing raises suspicion that the trial court is actively trying to 
prevent the record from being properly established. 
Finally, by rejecting exhibits central to Relator's emergency TRO application 
without legal justification, the clerk has effectively denied Relator the ability to 
make a complete record and present all relevant evidence to this court, thereby 
impairing Relator's due process rights. The rejected exhibits have been served on 
the opposing party and will be included in the supplemental record pursuant to Tex. 
R. App. P. § 52.7(b). 
 
CONCLUSION AND PRAYER 
 
Relator has been seeking relief for his children for over a year while the  
opposing party has failed to prosecute their case. They obtained orders by falsely 
claiming consent and then abandoned their case. There have been no filed 
responses to any relief sought by the Relator, no objections filed, and if the Relator 
had not opened the SAPCR to seek relief for his Children, there was no indication

that the real party in interest ever intended to move the dormant divorce proceeding 
towards final trial. There are no valid, legally binding orders in effect, yet they 
have been used to control the Relator’s livelihood and have destroyed the 
children’s status quo. The opposing counsel only resurfaced at the 11th hour in a 
separate proceeding for the sole purpose of interfering with the relief sought by the 
Relator without even being present in the courtroom. SUPP 2.19 
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Relator Charles Dustin Myers 
respectfully prays that this Court: 
1. Issue a writ of mandamus directing Respondent, the Honorable Kate Stone, 
Associate Judge of the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County, Texas, to hear 
and rule on Relator's Emergency Application for Temporary Restraining 
Order at the earliest practical date; 
2. Grant the emergency temporary relief requested in Relator's separate 
Emergency Motion under TRAP 52.10, filed concurrently with this petition 
because the orders are facially void; 
3. Take judicial notice that Relator has been unlawfully barred from his 
matrimonial residence and children under these void orders for over a year 
while the real party in interest has remained completely silent;

3. Standing
The law allows me to file this case because | am: (Check one.)
[] the mother of the child(ren).

[Ml the “legal father’ of the child(ren). An Acknowledgment of Paternity form has been signed and filed
with the Vital Statistics Unit for each child. A copy of each Acknowledgment of Paternity is attached to
this Petition.

[] a person who has had actual care, control, and possession of the child(ren) for at least 6 months
ending not more than 90 days before the date this Petition is filed with the Court. | am not a foster
parent.

CL] a person who lived with the child(ren) and the child(ren)’s parent, guardian, or managing conservator
for at least 6 months ending not more than 90 days before the date this Petition is filed with the Court,
and the child(ren)’s parent, guardian, or managing conservator is now dead.

[] the grandparent, great-grandparent, sister, brother, aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew of the child(ren)
and: (Check the box below that applies to your case.)

[] both parents are dead.
[1] both parents, the surviving parent, or managing conservator agree to me filing this case.

[] the child(ren)’s present circumstances will significantly impair (harm) the child(ren)’s physical
health or emotional development.

[] other:
(Read the law about standing in Texas Family Code Sections 102.003, 102.004 and 102.006)

Note: If you are the mother or biological father of the child/ren and an Acknowledgment of Paternity form has
not been signed and filed for each child, you may need to file a paternity case instead of a Suit Affecting the

Parent-Child Relationship (SAPCR) case. Get information about filing a paternity case at
www. TexasLawHelp.org.

4. Jurisdiction

There are no court orders about any of the child(ren). No other Court has continuing jurisdiction over this
case or the child(ren).

Texas has authority to decide this case because: (Check one.)
[ml The children live in Texas now and have lived in Texas for at least the past 6 months or since birth.

[] The children do not live in Texas now, but they have been gone from Texas less than 6 months. The
children had lived in Texas for at least 6 months before they moved. A parent or person acting as a
parent continues to live in Texas.

Important: Talk to a lawyer if neither of the above applies.

M.2055

Note: If there is already a court order about any of the children, you may need to file a modification case instead
of a Suit Affecting the Parent-Child Relationship (SAPCR) case. Get information about filing a modification case

at www. TexasLawHelp.org.

IN THE 233RD DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT: 
I. INTRODUCTION
There comes a time in the journey of life when a man finds himself standing 
in the same muddy footprints he left as a child, gazing up at the same towering 
courthouse steps, and feeling that same sinking sensation in his chest. It’s a peculiar 
thing, this cycle of disappointment—to have lived it once as a bewildered child and 
then again as a rule-abiding adult. The faces change, the dates on the calendar 
advance, but the feeling remains as familiar as an old, worn book. 
Petitioner comes before this Court not with anger burning in his chest, nor 
with vindictiveness poisoning his pen, but rather with that quiet, heavy 
disappointment that settles in a person’s bones when they’ve done everything by

the book only to find the book itself has been shelved away, forgotten by those 
sworn to read from it.  
Petitioner followed the rules. He honored the procedures. He placed his faith 
in a system that promised justice would flow like water, clear and unobstructed, to 
those who seek it properly. He lived under the façade of facially void orders, and 
sustained extraordinary damages that were all caused intentionally by one person: 
the Respondent, who has sat in complete silence as this breakdown has continued 
to occur. 
Yet here stands Petitioner, a father twice removed—once from his home 
and once from his children—knocking on the courthouse door with papers properly 
filed, only to be told that the door shall remain closed because someone else might, 
at some future date, file papers at another door entirely. If this strikes the Court as 
a curious interpretation of justice, then we find ourselves in rare agreement. 
Mark Twain once observed that “the difference between the almost right word and 
the right word is really a large matter—it’s the difference between the lightning bug 
and the lightning.” In matters of law and children’s welfare, the difference between 
almost justice and actual justice is equally vast—it’s the difference between 
children thriving and children suffering, between a father’s presence and his 
absence, between following the law and merely gesturing toward it.

ministerial duty to hear and rule on Petitioner’s properly filed emergency TRO, 
which this Court refused to hear on March 28, 2025. The refusal came not from any 
defect in the filing itself, but solely from representations made by opposing counsel 
regarding a future filing in another court which she abandoned—a procedural 
sleight of hand that has left children in distress and a father without an adequate 
remedy for an appeal. 
On the other hand, the Petitioner must prohibit the 322nd District Court from 
setting a matter for a hearing that cannot bear a valid result through a concurrent 
Writ of Prohibition. The proper procedure wasn’t followed, and cannot be 
overlooked in the face of an emergency. 
 
In essence, a procedurally improper forward-looking consolidation motion 
to be filed in a different court was used to block a properly filed emergency TRO 
before this court. The court cannot rule on a case not before it, and mandamus is 
the proper remedy here if this court refuses to act. Given the extraordinary 
circumstances of this matter, and given there has been no response or opposition to 
the relief being requested, the court should grant the emergency TRO 
immediately through a written order delivered to all the parties via the 
electronic filing manager, set the matter for a hearing 14 days from the signing of 
the order, and require a written response from the opposing party no later than 7 
days prior to the hearing.

Despite the circumstances of this case, Petitioner feels that settlement will 
and could be a possibility in the future, but the priority remains to rebuild the status 
quo of the children that has been destroyed and regain the ability to provide for his 
children financially while damages are assessed and attended to. Petitioner is at the  
very least entitled to this immediate relief.  He is not asking this court for anything 
more than what it has the discretion to do and what the law demands that it must do 
given the circumstances. This intent to file mandamus is filed out of respect and 
serves as a notice to all parties of record of my position on this matter. 
Such absurdity should end with an order from this court in Petitioner’s 
favor, and in support thereof, he shows the following unopposed facts: 
II. STATEMENT OF FACTS 
1. On January 24, 2025, after more than 11 months of inaction, Petitioner 
filed a Motion to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution. The divorce case no 
substantive action from Respondent since April 2024, a legal ghost ship drifting 
without direction or purpose. That motion wasn’t attempted to be set for hearing 
until September of 2024, only after the Petitioner exhausted all efforts seeking 
relief throughout the Texas Judiciary without any participation from the opposing 
side. 
2. On March 19, 2025, driven by mounting concerns about the children’s 
welfare and learning that the 322nd District Court did not have continuous, 
exclusive jurisdiction over the children in this matter, Petitioner filed a new

SAPCR in this Court (Cause No. 233-765358-25) seeking emergency relief for 
the children. The very next day, March 20, 2025, Ms. Carter suddenly reappeared 
like a character presumed missing in the second act, filing an answer to the 
SAPCR petition in this Court and thereby submitting to this Court’s jurisdiction 
by filing a response rather than a motion to abate. 
3. On March 21, 2025, Petitioner filed a verified Rule 12 motion 
challenging Ms. Carter’s authority to represent Respondent in this matter—the 
second such challenge, met with the same resounding silence as the first. 
4. On March 25, 2025, Petitioner filed an Objection to Consolidation and 
an Ex-Parte Emergency Motion for TRO. Two days later, on March 27, 2025, 
Petitioner contacted the court coordinator, requested a date and time to present the 
motion, and served the documents to the opposing party with the intent to present 
on March 28, 2025, at 9:00 A.M. before the Associate Judge of this Court. On that 
fateful morning of March 28, 2025, Petitioner drove to the courthouse, paid for 
parking, met with the coordinator, communicated with opposing counsel, and 
secured a hearing date of April 10, 2025. Petitioner then proceeded to the 
Associate Judge’s courtroom to present the TRO. 
5. Before Petitioner could present his case—before he could speak a single 
word about his children’s welfare—he was told that Ms. Carter would be filing a 
motion to consolidate in the 322nd District Court, that his motion was improperly 
before the court, and that the Associate Judge refused to hear the motion. It was a

curious thing, this refusal. Ms. Carter wasn’t even present in the courtroom, yet 
her words carried more weight than Petitioner’s physical presence, his properly 
filed papers, and most importantly, the urgent needs of his children. She stopped 
the proceedings with nothing more than word of mouth for the incorrect motion. 
A true showcasing of disregard for the process, and the children. 
6. On April 2, 2025, Petitioner filed a Pre-Objection to Motion to 
Consolidate in the 322nd District Court. Ms. Carter’s motion to consolidate wasn’t 
filed with the 322nd District Court until April 3, 2025—six days after she used its 
mere possibility to prevent this Court from hearing Petitioner’s emergency 
motion. Her motion disregarded Petitioner’s pre-objection entirely, as if it were 
invisible ink on the page. 
7. On April 4, 2025, unable to acquire a ruling due to Petitioner’s 
objection, Ms. Carter attempted to set the motion for a hearing before the 322nd 
District Court. That same day, Petitioner filed a Pre-Objection to Motion to 
Transfer in this Court, given that a motion to transfer must come before any 
attempt at consolidation. Ms. Carter, who had been so urgently concerned about 
consolidation when it served to block Petitioner’s emergency hearing, suddenly 
claimed to be unavailable until late April—causing significant delays that could 
have been avoided had this Court simply heard the motion before it on March 28, 
2025.

8. Throughout this period of procedural maneuvering, the children have 
been subjected to psychological manipulation and medical neglect. They have 
been removed from Petitioner’s care and placed with elderly great-grandparents 
on a daily basis, and are being gaslighted into a false belief that the divorce is 
finalized. Petitioner’s eldest child’s academic performance has plummeted, and 
both children have become emotionally estranged from both parents. Petitioner 
has suffered approximately $110,500 in verifiable financial damages due to being 
locked out of his home and business, and it grows each day. But the financial toll 
pales in comparison to the emotional cost of watching Petitioner’s children suffer 
while the courts exchange procedurally incorrect volleys over his head.  
III. ARGUMENT 
A. The Court's Ministerial Duty 
9. It is well-established Texas law that a trial court has a ministerial 
duty—not a discretionary duty—to consider and rule upon motions properly filed 
and pending before it. In re Sheppard, 193 S.W.3d 181, 183 (Tex. App.—Houston 
[1st Dist.] 2006, orig. proceeding); In re Chavez, 62 S.W.3d 225, 228 (Tex. 
App.—Amarillo 2001, orig. proceeding). The Texas Supreme Court has 
consistently held that while a court has discretion in how it rules on a motion, it 
has no discretion to refuse to rule at all. In re Blakeney, 254 S.W.3d 659, 661 
(Tex. App.—Texarkana 2008, orig. proceeding) ("When a motion is properly

duty—not a discretionary duty—to consider and rule upon motions properly filed
and pending before it. In re Sheppard, 193 S.W.3d 181, 183 (Tex. App.—Houston

motion is a ministerial act, and mandamus may issue to compel the trial judge to 
act."). 
10. This principle is not merely a procedural nicety but a fundamental 
cornerstone of our judicial system. When a court refuses to hear a properly filed 
motion, it effectively denies access to justice itself. As the Texas courts have 
repeatedly emphasized, "A trial court's refusal to rule on a pending motion within 
a reasonable amount of time constitutes a clear abuse of discretion." In re Bonds, 
57 S.W.3d 456, 457 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2001, orig. proceeding). This 
abuse is magnified exponentially when the motion concerns the welfare of 
children and seeks emergency relief. 
11. The Court's refusal to hear Petitioner's properly filed emergency TRO 
on March 28, 2025, constitutes a clear failure to perform a ministerial duty. This 
failure is particularly concerning given that: 
a) The motion was properly filed and noticed for hearing and the parties agreed 
on a date and time set for April 10th, 2025; 
b) Petitioner communicated with court staff, physically appeared at the 
courthouse ready to present the motion and was told he could present his 
motion; 
    c) The motion concerned the immediate welfare of children; and 
    d) The refusal was based solely on representations about a future filing in 
another court that had not yet occurred.

B. Clear Abuse of Discretion 
12. A writ of mandamus is appropriate when a trial court clearly abuses its 
discretion and there is no adequate remedy by appeal. In re Prudential Ins. Co. of 
Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 135-36 (Tex. 2004); Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 
840 (Tex. 1992). An abuse if discretion is clearly established from point one 
below, and supported by points two through eight: 
i. First, it refused to perform its ministerial duty to hear and 
rule on a properly filed motion based solely on representations 
about a future filing in another court. It’s as if a doctor refused to 
treat a bleeding patient because another doctor might, at some 
future date, claim the patient should be treated at a different 
hospital. 
ii. Second, it failed to recognize that by answering the 
SAPCR petition in this Court, Respondent submitted to this 
Court’s jurisdiction and should have instead filed a motion to abate 
or should have moved to transfer the case. The law doesn’t allow 
for half-measures of jurisdiction. 
iii. Third, it failed to recognize that this Court maintained 
jurisdiction until any transfer was completed pursuant to Texas 
Family Code § 155.005(d) as no final order has been rendered in 
the 322nd District Court. Jurisdiction isn’t a hot potato to be

dropped at the first mention of another court—it’s a solemn 
responsibility that remains until properly transferred.  
iv. Fourth, it failed to recognize that the proper procedure 
for consolidation of cases in different courts requires a motion to 
transfer to be filed and granted before any motion to consolidate 
can be considered, pursuant to Texas Family Code §§ 155.201 and 
6.407. The law provides a sequence, a proper order of operations, 
that cannot be reversed or circumvented without creating 
procedural delay, which is what the emergency TRO sought to 
prevent from occurring. 
v. Fifth, it allowed opposing counsel to circumvent proper 
legal procedure by influencing this Court’s decision without being

vii. Seventh, it failed to recognize that the Associate 
Judge’s orders in the divorce case were never properly adopted by 
the referring District Court as required by Texas Family Code § 
201.013(b). An unadopted order is like an unsigned check—it may 
look official, but it carries no legal weight, yet it has been used to 
bar the Petitioner from his residence, business, and children, and 
impose a disruptive and chaotic schedule upon the children. 
viii. Eighth, and perhaps most troublingly, it disregarded 
the children’s best interests in favor of procedural considerations, 
contrary to Texas Family Code § 153.002 and has languished for 
over a year due to the opposition’s failure to prosecute.

Petitioner’s children are suffering immediate and ongoing harm while procedural

S.W.3d 613, 615 (Tex. 2008) (granting emergency relief where children’s welfare 
was at immediate risk). Petitioner’s children are being alienated from him, 
causing long-term psychological damage that cannot be undone by a favorable 
ruling months or years in the future. In re Scheller, 325 S.W.3d 640, 643 (Tex. 
2010) (recognizing that interference with the parent-child relationship can 
constitute irreparable harm). 
14. The improper procedural maneuvers by opposing counsel are causing 
significant delays that cannot be remedied through the normal appellate process. 
Each day that passes is another day the children suffer, another day their academic 
performance declines, another day they become more emotionally estranged in a 
situation that the law should’ve prevented from existing to begin with. 
15. Temporary orders in family law cases are generally not appealable, 
leaving Petitioner in a procedural trap with no exit. Waiting for a final judgment 
to appeal would allow the improper procedural tactics to succeed, causing 
irreparable harm to Petitioner and his children.

D. Opposing Counsel’s Contradictory Behavior 
17. Cooper L. Carter’s contradictory behavior warrants particular 
attention, like a character in a novel whose actions never quite align with their 
words: She zealously defended her client by filing an answer to the SAPCR in this 
Court, thereby submitting to this Court’s jurisdiction, only to then influence this 
Court to refuse to hear Petitioner’s properly filed motion by representing that she 
would file a motion to consolidate in the 322nd Court, which would be moot by 
statute. 
18. She had abandoned the divorce case for nearly a year, filing nothing 
since April 24, 2024, only to suddenly reappear precisely when I sought 
emergency relief for the children—like a firefighter who ignores a smoldering 
house for months, only to rush in when someone else calls for help. She failed to 
respond to a Rule 12 motion challenging her authority to represent 
the Respondent, her silence speaking volumes about the nature of her 
representation. She subsequently filed an improper motion to consolidate in the 
322nd Court without first filing the required motion to transfer, putting the 
procedural cart before the horse. She is now claiming unavailability until late 
April in the 322nd Court, creating unnecessary delay after using the urgency of 
consolidation to block Petitioner’s emergency hearing.

19. This pattern demonstrates a tactical attempt to manipulate both courts’ 
dockets to prevent me from obtaining a timely hearing on Petitioner’s properly 
filed emergency motion. It’s a shell game played with the children’s welfare as 
the prize. This Court should not allow itself to be used as an instrument in such 
procedural gamesmanship, particularly when it involves a failure to perform a 
ministerial duty required by law and when children’s welfare is at stake. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
 
This Court’s refusal to hear Petitioner’s properly filed motion constitutes a 
failure to perform a ministerial duty for which there is no adequate remedy 
by appeal. The proper legal procedure requires a motion to transfer to be 
filed and granted before any motion to consolidate can be considered, and by

The children who are the subject of this proceeding are suffering

motion speaks volumes about how far we have strayed from the ideal of justice. 
The children— innocent, vulnerable, and deserving of the Court’s protection—
have instead become collateral damage in a game of procedural chess. 
Petitioner provides this petition not out of anger or vindictiveness, but out 
of that quiet, heavy disappointment that settles in a person’s bones when they’ve 
done everything by the book only to find the book itself has been shelved away. 
Petitioner followed the rules. He reiterates that he honored the procedures. He 
placed his faith in a system that promised justice would flow like water, clear and 
unobstructed, to those who seek it properly. 
Petitioner asks this Court to remember that behind every case number, 
behind every filing, behind every procedural rule, there are often real children 
with real lives that continue whether the courts act or not. Time doesn’t stop for 
them while adults sort out procedural disagreements. They grow, they hurt, they 
form memories and impressions that will shape them for a lifetime. 
As Mark Twain might have observed, the difference between justice 
served and justice delayed is the difference between a father’s presence and his 
absence, between children thriving and children suffering, between following the 
law and merely gesturing toward it.

this situation, and grant relief without delay given the extraordinary circumstances 
of this case. Petitioner specifically requests that this Court: 
i. 
Immediately grant the attached proposed order requesting an 
emergency TRO preventing the Respondent from barring 
Petitioner’s access to the matrimonial home located at 6641 Anne 
Court, Watauga, Texas 76148 pursuant to Texas Family Code § 
105.001(b) and serve the order on all parties of record through the 
EFM pursuant to rule 21a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure;  
ii. 
Have the parties confer with the court coordinator to set this matter 
for a hearing within 14 days from the signing of the order, and 
require Respondent’s written response no later than 7 days before 
the hearing;  
iii. 
Take judicial notice that this Court has personal jurisdiction over 
the respondent to issue a TRO given her response to the original 
SAPCR;   
iv. 
Take judicial notice that no opposition to the requested relief 
appears on record;  
v.

TO THE HONORABLE COURT: 
 
Petitioner, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, PRE-OBJECTS to any motion to transfer filed  
on behalf of COOPER L. CARTER in this matter, and in support thereof, shows the following: 
I. INTRODUCTION 
1. On March 28, 2025, Petitioner set a properly filed motion to be heard in front of the 
associate Judge. 
2. Petitioner was denied an opportunity to be heard due to the claim that COOPER L.  
CARTER would be filing a motion to consolidate in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County  
as justification for the denial of due process. 
 
3. On April 2nd, 2025, Petitioner filed a PRE-OBJECTION laying out the legal reasons  
why COOPER L. CARTER’s consolidation motion was improper, and premature. 
 
4. COOPER L. CARTER cannot move to consolidate this matter with the divorce suit  
pending before the 322nd District Court because the Texas Family Code 6.407(b) explicitly  
states: 
“On the transfer of the proceedings, the court with jurisdiction of the suit for dissolution of a 
marriage shall consolidate the two causes of action.”

TO THE HONORABLE COURT:
Petitioner, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, PRE-OBJECTS to any motion to transfer filed
on behalf of COOPER L. CARTER in this matter, and in support thereof, shows the following:
I. INTRODUCTION

1. On March 28, 2025, Petitioner set a properly filed motion to be heard in front of the
associate Judge.

2. Petitioner was denied an opportunity to be heard due to the claim that COOPER L.
CARTER would be filing a motion to consolidate in the 322™ District Court of Tarrant County
as justification for the denial of due process.

3. On April 2"¢, 2025, Petitioner filed a PRE-OBJECTION laying out the legal reasons
why COOPER L. CARTER’s consolidation motion was improper, and premature.

4. COOPER L. CARTER cannot move to consolidate this matter with the divorce suit
pending before the 322" District Court because the Texas Family Code 6.407(b) explicitly
States:

“On the transfer of the proceedings, the court with jurisdiction of the suit for dissolution of a
marriage shall consolidate the two causes of action.”

M.2085 M.2085

=== PAGE 62 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
 
5. Therefore, COOPER L. CARTER’s motion to consolidate is procedurally improper, and was  
used as a tool to interfere with emergency proceedings where no answer was provided. 
 
6. The court cannot refuse to hear a properly filed motion before it and give deference to an  
improperly filed motion notwithstanding COOPER L. CARTER’s misconduct and failure to prosecute the  
divorce suit. 
II. CONCLUSION 
 
7. For these reasons, Petitioner respectfully OBJECTS to any motion to transfer filed on behalf of  
COOPER L. CARTER. 
 
8. Furthermore, before any motion to transfer is to be set by COOPER L. CARTER, her authority  
pursuant to Rule 12 should be resolved by citing COOPER L. CARTER to appear and prove her authority  
to represent the Respondent in this matter.

NO. 322-744263-23 
IN THE 322nd DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
TO THE HONORABLE COURT: 
Under Texas law, the doctrine of dominant jurisdiction dictates that when two suits 
involving the same parties and subject matter are filed in courts of concurrent jurisdiction, the 
court where the suit was first filed typically acquires exclusive control. However, this 
presumption can be overcome by showing that the first suit was initiated in bad faith or for the 
purpose of delay. Texas courts, following the rule established in Wyatt v. Shaw Plumbing Co., 
recognize exceptions where the first suit was filed merely to establish procedural priority, in 
anticipation of subsequent litigation, or to stall the opposing party’s legitimate claims. These 
principles provide a vital check against strategic abuse of court processes and ensure 
jurisdictional fairness when forum manipulation is evident. 
This analysis looks into the circumstances surrounding this matter, and is presented in a 
good-faith effort to provide insight to the court.

Dominant Jurisdiction Analysis with Bad Faith Focus 
I. Legal Framework for Dominant Jurisdiction 
A. General Principles 
Under Texas law, the doctrine of dominant jurisdiction provides that when two suits are 
pending in courts of concurrent jurisdiction involving the same parties and subject matter, the 
court in which the suit was first filed acquires dominant jurisdiction to the exclusion of the other 
court. This doctrine is established in the seminal case of Curtis v. Gibbs, 511 S.W.2d 263 (Tex. 
1974), where the Texas Supreme Court held that any subsequent suit involving the same parties 
and controversy must be dismissed if a party to that suit calls the second court's attention to the 
pendency of the prior suit. 
B. Bad Faith Exception 
However, Texas courts recognize an important exception to the dominant jurisdiction 
doctrine: when the first-filed suit was brought in bad faith or for the purpose of delay. As 
established in Wyatt v. Shaw Plumbing Co., 760 S.W.2d 245, 248 (Tex. 1988), the first court's 
dominant jurisdiction can be defeated by showing that the first suit was filed: 
1. As a mere pretext to establish priority; 
2. In anticipation of the second suit; 
3. For the purpose of delay; or 
4. In bad faith. 
When this exception applies, the second court may proceed with its case despite the pendency of 
the first-filed suit.

e She falsely claimed family violence had occurred during the marriage to waive

the 60-day waiting period

e She falsely claimed financial responsibility for bills that Charles paid

e Despite claiming an active protective order already existed, she filed for another

one on December 22, 2023

B. Misrepresentations to the Court

1. False Allegations of Family Violence

e No evidence of family violence was ever presented

for divorce

2. False Financial Affidavits

e Morgan claimed indigent status immediately after transferring $1,576 from joint

account

•
Initial divorce filing claimed an active protective order existed when none did
•
These misrepresentations were designed to prejudice the court against Charles
C. Procedural Manipulation
1. Strategic Delays and Attorney Changes
•
At the January 22, 2024 hearing, Morgan appeared without counsel
•
She hired Cooper L. Carter on the spot in the courtroom lobby to cause further
delay
•
This tactic successfully delayed the case until February 1, further prejudicing
Charles
2. Self-Help Tactics Outside Legal Process
•
On March 6, 2024, Morgan illegally locked Charles outside the home
•
This occurred after Charles had filed notice with the court that he would not leave
until after the hearing
•
This demonstrated willingness to circumvent legal process
3. Systematic Non-Prosecution
•
After securing favorable temporary orders, Morgan's counsel ceased prosecuting
the case
•
Last action in the divorce matter was April 24, 2024, nearly one year ago

This pattern suggests the initial filing was not intended to resolve the dispute but
to secure tactical advantages
III. Application of Bad Faith Exception to Current Case
A. Legal Analysis
The facts of this case align precisely with the bad faith exception outlined in Wyatt v. Shaw 
Plumbing Co. The initial divorce filing shows clear evidence of being: 
1. A mere pretext to establish priority: The coordinated preparation of documents with
Dan Branthoover before any legitimate attempt at reconciliation or mediation
demonstrates the filing was pretextual.
2. Filed in anticipation of potential action by Charles: The timing of the filing after
Charles discovered evidence of an affair suggests anticipatory filing to gain tactical
advantage.
3. For the purpose of delay: The systematic non-prosecution of the case for nearly a year
after securing favorable temporary orders demonstrates the purpose was not resolution
but delay.
4. In bad faith: The numerous false statements in court filings, including claims about
protective orders, family violence, and financial status, constitute clear bad faith.

•
Court held that "filing a lawsuit for an improper purpose, such as to harass, cause
unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation, is sanctionable
conduct."
•
The pattern of behavior in the initial divorce filing aligns with this standard.
2. Perry v. Del Rio, 66 S.W.3d 239, 252 (Tex. 2001)
•
The Texas Supreme Court recognized that "the first-filed rule should not be
applied inflexibly or when doing so would reward gamesmanship or ill motive."
•
Morgan's coordinated preparation of divorce filings while misleading Charles
about her intentions constitutes precisely the kind of gamesmanship courts should
not reward.
3. Gonzalez v. Reliant Energy, Inc., 159 S.W.3d 615, 622 (Tex. 2005)
•
Court held that dominant jurisdiction does not apply when the first suit is filed "in
anticipation of the second suit and in an effort to subvert the second action."
•
The timing and coordination with Dan Branthoover suggest the divorce was filed
in anticipation of potential action by Charles after discovering the affair.
C. Family Law Context
In family law matters, courts have been particularly vigilant about bad faith filings due to their 
impact on children and families:

The Texas Supreme Court emphasized that in family law matters, courts must be
particularly vigilant about procedural gamesmanship that affects children's
welfare.
•
The false allegations of family violence and protective orders directly implicate
this concern.
2. In re Sims, 88 S.W.3d 297, 303-04 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2002, orig. proceeding)
•
Court held that in SAPCR cases, the best interest of the child can override strict
application of dominant jurisdiction.
•
The systematic non-prosecution of the case has prevented resolution, contrary to
the children's best interests.
IV. Implications for Current Proceedings
A. Legal Consequences of Bad Faith Finding
If the court determines the initial divorce filing was made in bad faith, several significant legal 
consequences follow: 
1. Dominant Jurisdiction Defeated: The 233rd District Court would not be bound by the
dominant jurisdiction of the 322nd District Court where the divorce was filed.
2. Consolidation Order Invalidated: The consolidation order would be invalid not only for
procedural defects but also because it erroneously applied dominant jurisdiction
principles to a bad faith filing.
3. Independent Proceeding Permitted: Charles's SAPCR filing in the 233rd District Court
could proceed independently, unaffected by the prior divorce filing.

4. Potential for Sanctions: The court could consider sanctions against Morgan and/or her
counsel for the bad faith filing and misrepresentations to the court.
B. Strategic Approach for Rehearing Motion
In the motion for rehearing, the bad faith analysis should be presented as an independent, 
alternative ground for mandamus relief: 
1. Primary Argument: The consolidation order should be vacated due to procedural defects
(lack of notice, hearing, proper transfer).
2. Alternative Argument: Even if procedurally proper, consolidation was improper
because the first-filed suit's dominant jurisdiction was defeated by bad faith.
3. Relief Requested: The court should:
•
Vacate the consolidation order
•
Recognize the 233rd District Court's authority to proceed independently with the
SAPCR
•
Order the trial court to hear Charles's emergency TRO on its merits
V. Conclusion
The doctrine of dominant jurisdiction is not an absolute rule but a principle of judicial 
efficiency that yields when its application would reward bad faith or procedural gamesmanship. 
The extensive evidence of coordination before filing, false statements in court documents, and 
systematic non-prosecution after securing favorable orders demonstrates that the initial divorce 
filing was made in bad faith.

Under Texas law, this bad faith defeats any claim of dominant jurisdiction by the 322nd District 
Court. Consequently, the consolidation order was not only procedurally defective but 
substantively erroneous in its application of dominant jurisdiction principles. The Court of 
Appeals should grant rehearing and issue mandamus relief to prevent the trial court from 
rewarding this bad faith through improper consolidation.

I. INTRODUCTION
Relator intends to invoke this Court’s original jurisdiction in three 
closely related mandamus proceedings arising from overlapping family law 
cases in Tarrant County. The three issues central to this dispute involve 
facially void temporary orders, the refusal to hear an emergency TRO, and 
the granting of the opposing party’s consolidation motion sua sponte in the 
face of an objection.  All three matters are legally and procedurally 
interdependent yet hinge on each-other to effectuate resolution. To provide 
context, the three mandamus matters are: 
1. No. 02-25-00164-CV (“TRO Mandamus”)
Issue Presented: Whether the 233rd District Court erred in refusing to 
adjudicate an emergency request for temporary relief in a SAPCR 
properly filed before it on March 28, 2025. 
Procedural Posture: Denied per curiam on April 11, 2025; rehearing 
Brief Posture: The TRO mandamus proceeding raises core legal issues 
concerning a trial court’s ministerial duty to rule on properly filed 
motions, the abuse of discretion in refusing to hear an emergency TRO 
based on a future, unfiled consolidation motion, and the denial of due 
process by refusing to rule on the matter before it. 
2. No. 02-25-00166-CV (“Void-Order Mandamus”)
Issue Presented: Whether temporary orders issued by the 322nd District 
Court on March 14, 2024, are void ab initio for want of consent. (MR 
17.1) 
Procedural Posture: Pending decision before this Court.

Brief Posture: Showcases a total breakdown of procedure between 
January 16th, 2024’s “kick-out” order (MR 6.1) and March 14th, 2024’s 
one-sided consent judgement. (MR. 17.38)

in the face of Relator’s standing objection to consolidate, and a pending 
rule 12 motion. 
II. BACKGROUND SUMMARY
Between December 14, 2023, and December 22, 2023, Real Party in 
Interest, Morgan Myers, attempted to get an emergency ex-parte order of 
protection from the court below (MR 2.7), initiated an eviction proceeding 
(MR 19.15), converted $1,576 of joint-marital assets to a family member on 
her way to receive help in preparing divorce paperwork (MR 19.14), initiated 
a protective order suit, (MR  19.15), and filed for divorce claiming that an 
active order of protection existed against the undersigned. (MR 2.7) 
This frenzy of frivolous lawsuits was designed to acquire an advantage 
in the divorce proceedings, which ultimately succeeded on January 16, 2024.

(MR 6.1). Spinning a narrative of the need for protection, Real Party leveraged 
this initial award to her advantage and was able to delay the proceedings 
further on January 22 by acquiring her legal representative three minutes prior 
to the hearing. (MR 7), eventually leading to settlement and a non-suit of her 
allegations (MR 8.3), which became the orders of the court on March 14, 
2024, and were rendered as an agreement without Mr. Myers’ consent. (MR. 
17.38) The remainder of the litigation amounted to a one-sided effort by the 
undersigned to seek relief while the opposing party sat in silence and 
abandoned their case. (MR 1) 
After eleven months of silence, the Real Party became active again 
only after the SAPCR was opened by Mr. Myers, who was prevented from 
presenting his emergency TRO at the 11th hour, resulting in no order, and 
the emergency still ongoing.
Shortly 
after 
the 
initial 
mandamus 
was 
filed on April 10, 
2025, the Honorable Kenneth Newell sua sponte consolidated the 
cases without notice by granting Real Party’s motion in the face of 
an objection, and without a hearing to discuss the pertinent issues. 
The undersigned is prepared to litigate these matters, and the necessity 
to stay these proceedings is essential to preserve the rights of the parties and 
prevent further irreparable harm from occurring in the interim.

III. NECESSITY FOR STAY
Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 52.10 Authorizes a Stay to 
Preserve the Status Quo. Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 52.10(b) 
empowers this Court to “stay the underlying proceedings pending mandamus 
review”. A stay is warranted here to “preserve important substantive and 
procedural rights from impairment or loss” which here, is exactly the 
situation calling for such a remedy.  
The procedural posture of this case combined by the lack of 
participation by the opposing side and lack of input from the courts below 
throughout presents a truly unique situation from a legal perspective.
IV. SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT
The 322nd and 233rd District Courts of Tarrant County, Texas, are 
locked in a jurisdictional impasse that must be resolved to protect the best 
interests of the children and restore procedural integrity. These matters can 
be concurrently resolved through stepwise legal analysis. The first and most 
critical question is whether the current temporary orders—issued as an 
agreed judgement without the consent of all parties—can stand (MR 17.1, 
MR 17.38).

If those orders are deemed void, then the 322nd District Court cannot 
assert continuing, exclusive jurisdiction (CEJ) under the Texas Family Code, 
which requires a valid final order to attach. see Tex. Fam. Code §155.001. In 
that event, the SAPCR filed in the 233rd District Court by the undersigned 
should stand as a procedurally proper original suit, and mandamus should 
issue to administer a hearing regarding the emergency TRO refused on 
March 28, 2025, without producing any valid order to challenge. 
At that juncture, should the Real Party argue dominant jurisdiction, the 
court must weigh the well-recognized exceptions under Texas law, including 
bad faith, unjustified delay, and strategic pretext—all of which are clearly 
demonstrated and conclusively established in the mandamus record filed 
concurrently with this matter. 
V. ARGUMENT
A. An agreed judgement rendered without consent is void
The first point of issue in this matter is the facially void orders rendered
on March 14, 2024. an order cannot expressly claim all parties consent “as 
evidenced by the signatures below” (MR 17.1) and then be absent from the 
document. (MR 17.38)

This is clear and cut Texas precedent. “A valid consent judgment cannot 
be rendered by a court when consent of one of the parties thereto is wanting. 
It is not sufficient to support the judgment that a party's consent thereto may 
at one time have been given; consent must exist at the very moment the court 
undertakes to make the agreement the judgment of the court.” Burnaman v. 
Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 (Tex. 1951) 
Here, the exact opposite occurred but our case takes it a step further. 
Mr. Myers was ordered to sign an agreement that he was in court that very 
same day to challenge. (MR 16.1) (“3. It is ordered that the parties shall 
present the temporary orders regarding the [associate judge’s report] signed 
on 02/01/2024 by 1:30 p.m. today.”)  
 
Moreover, the order explicitly refers to the Associate Judge’s Report 
signed on February 1, 2024, which could not have been possible because the 
attorney who was ordered to prepare the orders was no longer on the case. 
(MR 11) Therefore, the orders must be set aside, and mandamus should issue 
here. 
B. Continuous, exclusive jurisdiction 
Once the orders are declared void, we can then turn to the Texas Family 
Code § 155.001(a), which states “Specifically, except as otherwise provided

by this section, a court acquires continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the 
matters provided for by this title in connection with a child on the rendition of 
a final order.” Without the March 14 orders in place, which were a nullity from 
the start, the 322nd District Court does not retain continuous, exclusive 
jurisdiction as no other orders exist. Therefore, § 155.001(d) makes the 
SAPCR suit valid by statute, which leads us to an analysis of dominant 
jurisdiction. 
C. Doctrine of Dominant Jurisdiction
 Under Texas law, the doctrine of dominant jurisdiction provides that 
when two suits are pending in courts of concurrent jurisdiction involving the 
same parties and subject matter, the court in which the suit was first filed 
acquires dominant jurisdiction to the exclusion of the other court. This 
doctrine is established in the seminal case of Curtis v. Gibbs, 511 S.W.2d 263 
(Tex. 1974), where the Texas Supreme Court held that any subsequent suit 
involving the same parties and controversy must be dismissed if a party to that 
suit calls the second court's attention to the pendency of the prior suit. 
Normally, if the SAPCR matter were to try and set a matter for hearing, 
the Real Party could argue for dominant jurisdiction, as the divorce matter

was the “first filed” suit, and is pending before the 322nd District Court, and 
would have the suit transferred or abated. 
D. Bad Faith Exception
However, Texas courts recognize an important exception to the 
dominant jurisdiction doctrine: when the first-filed suit was brought in bad 
faith or for the purpose of delay. As established in Wyatt v. Shaw Plumbing 
Co., 760 S.W.2d 245, 248 (Tex. 1988), the first court's dominant jurisdiction 
can be defeated by showing that the first suit was filed:  
1. As a mere pretext to establish priority;
2. In anticipation of the second suit;
3. For the purpose of delay; or
4. In bad faith.
E. Three of four exceptions to dominant jurisdiction apply here
Here, three out of four of these exceptions apply. The suit was a mere 
pretext to establish priority, as Real Party went out of her way to file multiple 
frivolous lawsuits alleging family violence (MR 2.7, MR 3) only to then drop 
her claims after securing the children and home and abandon the case. (MR 
8.3)

The bad faith conducted by Real Party can be discerned by looking at 
the face of her pleadings themselves. On her original petition for divorce, on 
page 7, Real Party makes it known that she attempted to seek an emergency 
ex-parte order of protection on December 14, 2023. (MR 2.7) So the logical 
question to ask would be: why did Real Party need an emergency ex-parte 
order of protection if she already had an active order of protection? Better 
yet, why did mother seek a third protective order on December 22, 2023, if an 
active protective order was already in place? (MR 3) More importantly, why 
would she claim an active order of protection existed when she knew that 
wasn’t the case? (MR 2.7) This is a clear establishment of bad faith litigation, 
which also precluded her advantage by labeling the undersigned as an abuser 
prior to adjudication, satisfying two of four exceptions to dominant 
jurisdiction. 
Finally, after acquiring the children and home at the outset (MR. 6.1) 
and through the series of orders leading up to March 14, 2024, Real Party 
then abandoned her case and left the undersigned seeking relief throughout 
the Texas judiciary without opposition or participation. The only item found

The bad faith conducted by Real Party can be discerned by looking at
the face of her pleadings themselves. On her original petition for divorce, on
page 7, Real Party makes it known that she attempted to seek an emergency
ex-parte order of protection on December 14, 2023. (MR 2.7) So the logical
question to ask would be: why did Real Party need an emergency ex-parte
order of protection if she already had an active order of protection? Better
yet, why did mother seek a third protective order on December 22, 2023, if an
active protective order was already in place? (MR 3) More importantly, why
would she claim an active order of protection existed when she knew that
wasn’t the case? (MR 2.7) This is a clear establishment of bad faith litigation,
which also precluded her advantage by labeling the undersigned as an abuser
prior to adjudication, satisfying two of four exceptions to dominant
jurisdiction.

Finally, after acquiring the children and home at the outset (MR. 6.1)
and through the series of orders leading up to March 14, 2024, Real Party
then abandoned her case and left the undersigned seeking relief throughout
the Texas judiciary without opposition or participation. The only item found
on the docket from the opposing side since then is a motion for pre-trial

conference on April 24, 2024. (MR 1.7 DKT 206) In fact, it was only when

the undersigned opened the separate SAPCR that opposing counsel rushed in 
to defend it, leading to the concurrent mandamus filed under cause number 
No. 02-25-00164-CV currently at the rehearing stage. 
Therefore, because three of the four exceptions established in Wyatt 
apply here, the 322nd District Court of Tarrant county arguably would not 
retain dominant jurisdiction over the SAPCR suit filed by the undersigned to 
escape this procedural quagmire, and mandamus could issue there on 
rehearing so that they may lawfully proceed with the emergency TRO 
hearing which was turned away on March 28, 2025, which will lead to a 
situation that resembles what the legislature intends rather than the exact 
opposite. See Tex. Fam. Code 153.001. 
VI. Under the procedural posture of this case, a stay is not burdensome or
unduly prejudicial to the Real Party 
Given the unique and intertwined procedural posture of this matter, a 
stay is both appropriate and necessary to preserve the integrity of appellate 
review. Unlike Relator and the children—who continues to suffer irreparable 
harm under the force of void orders and were thrown into a chaotic 
arrangement —the Real Party in Interest faces no comparable prejudice from 
a stay. In fact, the Real Party has taken no meaningful action to prosecute their

VII. PRAYER
To the undersigned’s knowledge, no pro se litigant has ever been 
compelled to file three concurrent mandamus petitions addressing three 
separate structural irregularities involving two district courts in a single-
family law matter. This unprecedented procedural posture is not the result of 
litigation excess, but rather a response to a cascading breakdown of 
jurisdiction, due process, and court administration, which independently 
threatens the ability of this Honorable Court to grant meaningful relief. 
In fact, the only litigation that has occurred in this case has come from 
the undersigned. This litigation is not fueled by vindictiveness nor spite, but 
rather from the necessity to restore the status quo so that this divorce may 
proceed. The Relator holds the upmost respect for all three Judges named in 
this suit, and it is his prerogative to aid in the case’s forward-looking

ARGUMENT 
A. Mandamus Standard
Mandamus relief is warranted when the trial court clearly abused its 
discretion, and the Relator (“Mr. Myers”), has no adequate appellate remedy. In re 
Coppola, 535 S.W.3d 506, 508 (Tex. 2017) (orig. proceeding) (per curiam). “A 
trial court clearly abuses its discretion if ‘it reaches a decision so arbitrary and 
unreasonable as to amount to a clear and prejudicial error of law' [or if it clearly 
fails] to analyze or apply the law correctly ․” Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 
839–40 (Tex. 2006) (orig. proceeding) (quoting Johnson v. Fourth Court of 
Appeals, 700 S.W.2d 916, 917 (Tex. 1985), disapproved of on other grounds by In 
re Columbia Med. Ctr. of Las Colinas, Subsidiary, L.P., 290 S.W.3d 204 (Tex. 
2009)). In any event, as shown in the next section, appeal is no remedy at all under 
these urgent circumstances. 
B. Consolidation and EX-Parte Procedure
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 174(a) permits consolidation of actions that 
involve common questions of law or fact. (APP 6.1) See also Lone Star Ford, Inc. v. 
McCormick, 838 S.W.2d 734, 737 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1992, writ 
denied). A trial court cannot arbitrarily consolidate cases in a manner that 
prejudices one of the parties. Even when consolidation is permissible in principle, 
the court must balance judicial convenience against any risk of unfair prejudice or

re Columbia Med. Ctr. of Las Colinas, Subsidiary, L.P., 290 S.W.3d 204 (Tex.
2009)). In any event, as shown in the next section, appeal is no remedy at all under
these urgent circumstances.

B. Consolidation and EX-Parte Procedure

Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 174(a) permits consolidation of actions that
involve common questions of law or fact. (APP 6.1) See also Lone Star Ford, Inc. v.
McCormick, 838 S.W.2d 734, 737 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1992, writ
denied). A trial court cannot arbitrarily consolidate cases in a manner that
prejudices one of the parties. Even when consolidation is permissible in principle,

the court must balance judicial convenience against any risk of unfair prejudice or

confusion, and it must respect the parties’ right to be heard on the issue. Crestway 
Care Ctr., Inc. v. Berchelmann, 945 S.W.2d 872, 874 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 
1997, orig. proceeding) (en banc). Consolidation decisions are reviewed for abuse 
of discretion, and “a trial court may abuse its discretion by … consolidating cases 
when the consolidation results in prejudice to the complaining party.” (citing Lone 
Star Ford, 838 S.W.2d at 738)  
In other words, when deciding whether to consolidate, the trial court must 
balance the judicial economy and convenience that may be gained by the 
consolidation against the risk of an unfair outcome because of prejudice. See Dal-
Briar, 833 S.W.2d at 615. Even if the cases share common questions of law and 
fact, an abuse of discretion may be found if the consolidation results in 
prejudice to the complaining party. Lone Star Ford, Inc., 838 S.W.2d at 738. 
Here, that is precisely what occurred. Mr. Myers has three concurrent 
mandamuses now before this court, and cause number 02-25-00164-CV, (“the 
TRO/SAPCR mandamus”) sought emergency relief in March 2025. (MR 8.2) The 
court’s procedural handling of his Application for Temporary Restraining Order 
(TRO) was highly irregular and violated the letter and spirit of Texas procedural 
rules.  
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 680 provides that no TRO shall be granted 
without notice to the adverse party unless specific facts show immediate

irreparable injury will occur before notice can be given. Even when an ex parte 
TRO is justified, TRCP 680 requires the order to be narrowly time-limited (14 
days) and promptly set for hearing on a temporary injunction. (APP 7) Here, Mr. 
Myers followed the rules by giving notice to the opposing party and coordinating 
with the Court for a presentation of his TRO. (MR 12.1-12.9) Tarrant County Local 
Rule 4.01(11)(e) (likewise requires a party seeking ex parte relief to certify to the 
Court the efforts made to notify the opposing side or explain why notice should not 
be given. Mr. Myers never received a response from the opposing side. 
Notably, on March 27, 2025, the Court (through its coordinator) insisted that 
Mr. Myers appear in person to present the TRO and inform opposing counsel of the 
scheduled time. The coordinator wrote:  
“This order needs to be presented in person. Likewise, you need to inform opposing 
counsel of the date and time you intend to present this order to the court.” (MR 12.9) 
Mr. Myers promptly complied. He emailed Ms. Allison on March 27 
confirming that he had informed the opposing counsel of the intended presentation 
at 9:00 a.m. the following day and that he would update both the Court and 
opposing party if anything changed. (MR 12.9) 
After receiving no response from either the opposing counsel or real party in 
interest, Mr. Myers served the documents he intended to present to the court. (MR 
12.19) Rather than corresponding with Mr. Myers directly, the opposing counsel 
contacted the court coordinator, where she stated via email:

in Parker County and is unable to attend. However, I will be available by cell phone regarding 
this matter if the Judge would like to speak to me regarding the Emergency TRO. Please 
contact our office to patch me in for any calls that Judge would like to have.” (MR 12.20) 
and most critically, the opposing counsel went on to say: 
“Additionally, this case already is pending in the 322nd for a divorce proceeding 
regarding property and children matters. We will be consolidating the case and walking it 
through the 322nd for signature next week.” (MR 12.20) 
The following morning, Mr. Myers made an appearance, as confirmed by the 
coordinator.  
“Mr. Myers appeared before me to schedule the hearing for the TRO; my apologies I did 
not realize this was that same case.  We can go ahead and set the TRO with us, but most 
likely the case will be transferred prior to the hearing date and the case needs to be 
transferred prior to that date. Mr. Myers will be emailing with dates available for the 
hearing.” (MR 12.24) 
This was followed by the following email: 
“Additionally, since there is an objection to the consolidation, y’all will need to reach out 
to request how to proceed 
with the 322nd as I am usure of their procedures.” (MR 12.25) 
Mr. Myers then promptly provided dates at 9:59 a.m. on March 28, 2025, (MR  
12.26) the hearing was agreed to be set for April 10, 2025. (MR 12.29) Despite

threshold matters should have came second to the best interests of the children. See 
Tex. Fam. Code 153.002. (APP 5) 
That statement – “I did not realize this was that same case” (MR 12.24)  – is a 
stunning acknowledgment of a procedural lapse. It indicates that the Court failed to 
connect the dots that Mr. Myers’ new case concerning the child was related to the 
ongoing divorce case. As a result, instead of promptly hearing Mr. Myers TRO on 
its merits, the Court stalled and immediately contemplated moving the case away, 
leaving Mr. Myers’ emergency request in limbo. The only individuals who 
followed proper procedure here were the undersigned and the court coordinator, 
non-licensed individuals. (MR 12.24)  
In summary, the procedure leading up to Respondent’s abuse of discretion 
was an abuse of discretion itself, warranting the “TRO/SAPCR Mandamus” that 
was denied per curiam without any substance. (APP 4) 
It was made very clear by the 233rd court that the consolidation motion filed 
by the opposing party on March 20, 2025, was filed in the incorrect court. (MR 5) 
(MR 12.17) This was used against Mr. Myers at the 11th hour to prevent the TRO 
hearing, as shown above. The forward-looking consolidation motion that was used 
to justify denying Mr. Myers his day in court was filed by RODERICK D. MARX, 
a non-party in either the SAPCR suit or the divorce matter on April 3, 2025. (MR

Shortly thereafter, the opposing counsel emailed Mr. Myers stating: 
“This is to inform you that I will be walking through the attached Motion for 
Consolidation and Proposed Order tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m. in the 322nd for 
signature.” (MR 12.31) 
Mr. Myers promptly replied, stating: 
“I've already objected. 
You have no legal authority to do so until you address my objection filed and 
served to you.” (MR 12.32) 
This procedural gamesmanship is the exact reason why the undersigned opened a 
new SAPCR, as it has left the divorce to languish outside of one-sided attempts to 
pursue relief, as clearly pointed out in his pleadings. There has been no meaningful 
discussion on the merits of this matter with the opposing side and no attempt to 
prosecute outside of the latest stunt to block emergency relief. (MR 1.1) From 
there, Mr. Myers filed a NOTICE OF INTENT TO SEEK MANDAMUS RELIEF 
in the 233rd (MR 14) and began preparing his first mandamus brief, which was 
submitted to this court on April 10, 2024. 
I. The Respondent clearly abused his discretion he sua sponte granted Real
Party’s contested consolidation motion without notice and hearing to the 
parties.

C. ABUSE OF DISCRETION
Immediately after submitting his first mandamus petition, Mr. Myers was 
served with an ORDER GRANTING CONSOLIDATION. (MR 15) This motion, 
which was used as a barrier to relief, was granted sua sponte by the same court 
who just declined to hear an emergency TRO before it. 
The record leaves no doubt that Respondent’s decision to consolidate the 
cases without notice or a hearing was a gross departure from the fair administration 
of justice. It is difficult to imagine a more textbook abuse of discretion: a contested 
motion was granted sua sponte, with no opportunity for the opposing party to be 
heard. This is not a close call or a minor procedural wrinkle. The facts speak for 
themselves – equity, due process, and basic procedural fairness were all denied in 
one fell swoop. The only question is whether they will continue to be ignored. 
Texas courts have held that a trial court clearly abuses its discretion by 
granting a contested motion sua sponte without providing notice or a hearing. In 
D.A. Buckner Constr., Inc. v. Hobson, for example, the trial judge entered an order
(imposing sanctions) even though the affected party had no notice or opportunity to 
be heard. The court of appeals declared that order void and emphatically stated: 
“Respondent’s order was without notice or hearing. Under these circumstances, the 
trial court’s order is void, and mandamus will lie to vacate such an order.” Such is 
the case here. Therefore, the law should apply equally.

D. NO ADEQUATE REMEDY 
In determining whether an appeal is an adequate remedy, courts have 
weighed the benefits over the detriments. In re BP Prods. N. Am., Inc., 244 S.W.3d 
840, 845 (Tex.2008) (orig.proceeding).  A party establishes that no adequate 
appellate remedy exists by showing it is in real danger of losing its substantial 
rights. Perry v. Del Rio, 66 S.W.3d 239, 257 (Tex.2001) (orig.proceeding). As 
repeatedly stated throughout these proceedings, Relator has been deprived of the 
most fundamental rights one can have: the right to possess and protect his home, 
and the right to care for, maintain contact with, and make decisions regarding his 
minor children. These rights are not abstract — they are protected by the U.S. 
Constitution, the Texas Constitution, and longstanding precedent. 
E. ONGOING AND IRREPARABLE HARM 
The Texas Supreme Court has repeatedly reaffirmed that “a parent’s rights to 
the care, custody, and control of their children are constitutional in nature and must 
be afforded heightened protection.” In re C.J.C., 603 S.W.3d 804, 809 (Tex. 2020). 
Likewise, property rights — including the right to remain in and possess one’s 
home — are protected under Article I, Section 19 of the Texas Constitution and the 
Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. See also University of Tex. Med. 
Branch v. Than, 901 S.W.2d 926, 930 (Tex. 1995)

When such rights are denied without valid order, hearing, or opportunity to 
be heard — as occurred here — the violation is not merely procedural: it is a 
constitutional injury, and one that warrants immediate mandamus relief. For all 
reasons incorporated herein, Mandamus should be issued, as deprivation is 
ongoing, and will occur until justice is rightfully served. 
Relator has clearly established the Respondent’s consolidation was both 
procedurally improper, and prejudicial. For all reasons incorporated herein, the 
court should uphold Texas precedent, and issue mandamus relief to restore justice 
to these proceedings. 
CONCLUSION 
With a prima facie showing of systemic abuse laid bare across the trilogy of 
mandamus petitions now before this Court, it is no longer credible to characterize 
the lower court’s conduct as isolated error. Two of the three heads of this 
procedural dragon—embodied by the 233rd, the 322nd, and this very Court—have 
already rendered per curiam denials, offering no explanation in the face of 
documented, unrebutted misconduct. The record in each petition stands 
unopposed. No adversary response has been filed. No evidentiary challenge has 
been made. The silence against Relator’s claims is not merely strategic—it is 
telling. A dangerous precedent is being forged in silence. This court must act.

PRAYER 
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Relator CHARLES DUSTIN 
MYERS respectfully prays that this Honorable Court: 
1. Issue a writ of mandamus compelling the Hon. Kenneth Newell, Judge of
the 233rd District Court, to vacate the April 2025 consolidation order, as it
was entered sua sponte on a contested motion;
2. Take judicial notice of the procedural irregularities and record-supported
adversity faced by Relator throughout these proceedings, including the
refusal to hear his emergency TRO while simultaneously granting relief to
the opposing party;
3. Grant all other relief to which Relator may be justly entitled, at law or in
equity, in light of the extraordinary circumstances and ongoing deprivation
of due process.
Relator has before this Court three petitions for writ of mandamus. Two have
already been denied per curiam without explanation—perhaps the result of routine 
disregard for pro se filings. But on rehearing, this Court is urged to evaluate this 
petition in conjunction with its sister mandamuses to fully grasp the depth of 
systemic abuse, procedural evasion, and judicial inconsistency present in the courts 
below.

PRAYER

WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Relator CHARLES DUSTIN

MYERS respectfully prays that this Honorable Court:

1. Issue a writ of mandamus compelling the Hon. Kenneth Newell, Judge of
the 233rd District Court, to vacate the April 2025 consolidation order, as it

was entered sua sponte on a contested motion;

2. Take judicial notice of the procedural irregularities and record-supported
adversity faced by Relator throughout these proceedings, including the
refusal to hear his emergency TRO while simultaneously granting relief to

the opposing party;

3. Grant all other relief to which Relator may be justly entitled, at law or in
equity, in light of the extraordinary circumstances and ongoing deprivation

of due process.

Relator has before this Court three petitions for writ of mandamus. Two have

disregard for pro se filings. But on rehearing, this Court is urged to evaluate this

Individually, each mandamus reveals a failure of 
process. Together, they form a “Dragon in Triplicate” — 
a coordinated denial of justice across courts that were 
sworn to protect it.

ISSUES PRESENTED FOR RECONSIDERATION 
Rehearing Issue No. 1: 
According to the Texas Supreme Court, mandamus may issue to compel a 
judge to perform a ministerial act. The panel erred by overlooking that the 
trial court had a legal duty to act, that a demand for performance was made, 
and that the court refused to rule. 
Rehearing Issue No. 2: 
The panel erred by overlooking that the burden for mandamus was satisfied. 
The mandamus and supplemental records establish a prima facie showing 
that an emergency TRO was properly filed, a date and time to present the 
motion was secured, opposing counsel participated in scheduling the full 
hearing, and the trial court declined to proceed, resulting in no ruling or 
order.

TO THE HONORABLE SECOND COURT OF APPEALS: 
Relator CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS respectfully moves this Honorable 
Court for en banc reconsideration of the panel decisions rendered in three separate 
but interwoven mandamus proceedings to be presented for reconsideration in the 
following order: 
i. Cause No. 02-25-00166-CV (denied April 14, 2025) (“Void Order”)
ii. Cause No. 02-25-00171-CV (denied April 17, 2025) (“Consolidation”)
iii. Cause No. 02-25-00164-CV (denied April 11, 2025) (“SAPCR/TRO”)
This motion serves as the third filed reconsideration motion and addresses 
the panel’s denial of Cause No. 02-25-00164-CV (attached as Tab A), referred to as 
the “SAPCR” mandamus.  It is respectfully submitted that the panel’s per curiam 
dismissal overlooked substantial, uncontested factual inaccuracies and manifest 
procedural deficiencies meticulously substantiated within the mandamus and 
supplemental mandamus records. Such judicial oversight necessitates 
comprehensive en banc scrutiny to preserve jurisprudential coherence and fidelity 
to established precedents of Texas law. 
Relator welcomes a response from the Real Party or Respondent if such 
would provide meaningful insight into the situation.

STATEMENT OF FACTS 
On March 19, 2025, Relator filed a SAPCR as an original proceeding in the 
233rd District Court of Tarrant County which was subsequently answered by 
counsel for Real Party in Interest the following day. (MR 3).  An emergency TRO 
was later filed on March 24, 2025, in the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County. 
(MR 7, MR 7.26) The trial court was asked to perform a ministerial duty when a 
date and time was secured to present the motion. (SUPP 2.11, SUPP 2.24, SUPP 
2.26). The undersigned appeared on March 28, 2025, and it is undeniable that the 
full hearing was set for April 10, 2025, at 9:30a.m. The judge refused to hear the 
motion. Accordingly, no appealable order was issued.   
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT 
It is clear that the trial court below had a ministerial duty to act and refused 
to do so. When a trial court fails to rule on a motion that is properly filed and 
brought to its attention, the abuse of discretion is established as a matter of law. 
This aligns with longstanding mandamus jurisprudence, which requires only three 
elements to establish a clear abuse of discretion: the existence of a legal duty to 
act, a clear request for that action, and the court’s failure or refusal to do so. In re 
Shredder Co., L.L.C., 225 S.W.3d 676, 679 (Tex. App.- El Paso 2006, orig. 
proceeding); Stoner v. Massey, 586 S.W.2d 843, 846 (Tex. 1979).  All three 
elements are present here.

ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITY 
I.
Although disfavored in routine matters, en banc reconsideration is
appropriate where the legal standard is met, as it is here.
En banc reconsideration is reserved for the rare case that satisfies one or 
both of the “hard-to-satisfy requirements” set forth in Texas Rule of Appellate 
Procedure 41.2(c): ensuring uniformity in the court’s decisions or addressing 
extraordinary circumstances. The Texas Supreme Court has endorsed this narrow 
standard, cautioning against overuse to preserve judicial efficiency and ensure that 
“the appellate trains... run on time.” See In re Marriage of Harrison, 507 S.W.3d 
259, 260–61 (Tex. App.—[14th Dist.] 2016) (Frost, J., dissenting).  
Here, this is precisely the kind of novel case that warrants en banc 
reconsideration. The panel’s decision threatens a fundamental departure from 
settled Texas law—made more urgent by the fact that the emergency relief sought 
is on behalf of two minor children and remains unopposed by any party at the time 
of filing this motion. 
Further, the subject matter of this case—three concurrently pending 
mandamus proceedings, all arising from distinct but interconnected abuses of 
discretion—constitutes an extraordinary circumstance. Each petition was denied 
per curiam by the same panel despite a clearly established record of procedural 
violations and judicial inaction. The en banc court should examine and correct the

panel’s cursory denials to ensure that this Court’s precedent does not inadvertently 
endorse or perpetuate abuses of discretion that have been thoroughly documented 
across the mandamus and supplemental records without any opposition. 
II.
The panel’s per curiam denial conflicts with controlling authority and
overlooks critical facts established in the mandamus and
supplemental mandamus records.
"When a motion is properly filed and pending before the trial court, the act 
of giving consideration to and ruling upon that motion is a ministerial act, and 
mandamus may issue to compel the trial judge to act."  Safety-Kleen Corp. v. 
Garcia, 945 S.W.2d 268, 269 (Tex. App.- San Antonio 1997, orig. proceeding). 
However, the Relator must demonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion by 
failing or refusing to perform a ministerial act. 
A. The trial court abused its discretion by failing to rule on a properly filed
motion after being asked to act.
To establish an abuse of discretion, the Relator must show that the trial court 
received a properly filed motion, was made aware of it, and was asked to rule—
whether through direct correspondence or other documents drawing the court’s 
attention to the matter. See In re Villarreal, 96 S.W.3d 708, 710 (Tex. App.—
Amarillo 2003, orig. proceeding). 
Here, the email correspondence between the court coordinator of the 233rd 
District Court, counsel for Real Party, and the undersigned found in SUPP 2.17-
2.22 clearly demonstrates that: 1) a motion was filed and properly before the court

without objection; 2) the undersigned appeared in person at a designated time and 
requested the court rule on his motion with a full trial setting secured for April 10, 
2025; 3) the court refused to rule on the motion.  
Therefore, the trial court clearly abused its discretion by refusing to perform 
a ministerial act after being properly asked to rule on a pending motion, which is 
well supported in the verified supplemental mandamus record. When a motion has 
been properly filed and brought to the attention of the trial court, the act of 
considering and ruling upon the motion is ministerial in nature, and mandamus 
may issue to compel the trial court to act.  See In re Layton, 257 S.W.3d 794, 795 
(Tex. App.— Amarillo 2008, orig. proceeding).  
B. By refusing to act, the Relator was left without an adequate remedy for an 
appeal. 
By refusing to rule, no order was issued. This left the undersigned without 
an adequate remedy by appeal and thus satisfies the standard for mandamus relief. 
See In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 135 (Tex. 2004). In other 
words, there is no adequate remedy at law for a trial court's failure to rule 
because "[f]undamental requirements of due process mandate an opportunity to be 
heard." See In re Christensen, 39 S.W.3d 250, 251 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2000, 
orig. proceeding). Here, those fundamental requirements were not satisfied, 
resulting in these proceedings.

CONCLUSION AND PRAYER 
Considering the facts incorporated herein, the en banc court should revisit 
the denial issued by the panel on April 11, 2025. (attached as Tab 1) It remains 
undisputed that an emergency motion was before the trial court (MR 7) the trial 
court was asked to rule on that motion, and the trial court refused to do so. 
The undersigned, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, therefore, respectfully 
prays that this Court grant en banc reconsideration, withdraw or vacate the panel’s 
per curiam denial, and remand this cause back to the 233rd District Court of Tarrant 
County for further proceedings consistent with law and justice. In doing so, the 
undersigned asks this Court to consider not only the record in this case, but the 
totality of the circumstances presented across all three pending en banc motions—
each evidencing distinct but interlocking abuses of discretion that have left him 
without an adequate appellate remedy. The Triplicate of per curiam denials should 
be reconsidered. Relator holds deep respect for the judiciary, the judges of this 
Court, and all parties involved, and trusts that neither his zealous advocacy nor his 
self-represented status detracts from the merits of the arguments presented.

ABSTRACT 
This research paper examines whether the Temporary Orders signed on 
March 14, 2024, in Cause No. 322-744263-23 (322nd District Court, Tarrant 
County) are facially void or legally invalid due to procedural irregularities. The 
analysis focuses on how the Associate Judge's Reports from February 1, 2024, 
and March 14, 2024, were processed, highlighting significant deviations from 
required legal procedures. The paper evaluates these irregularities against the 
framework of Texas Family Code provisions, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and 
relevant case law. Particular attention is given to issues of consent, due process 
violations, and the legal consequences of these procedural failures. The research 
concludes with an assessment of potential remedies, including mandamus relief 
and other direct attacks to vacate the orders.

I. INTRODUCTION AND ISSUE PRESENTED 
A. Overview of the Case 
This report examines whether the Temporary Orders signed on March 26, 2024, 
in Cause No. 322-744263-23 (322nd District Court, Tarrant County) are facially void or 
legally invalid. Evidence indicates serious procedural irregularities in how the Associate 
Judge's Reports from February 1, 2024, and March 14, 2024, were handled. 
The case involves a family law matter between Morgan Myers (Petitioner) and 
Charles Myers (Respondent). The procedural history reveals a concerning pattern of 
deviations from standard legal practice and explicit judicial directives. Of particular 
concern are the following newly uncovered facts: 
The February 1, 2024, Associate Judge's Report required a typed Temporary 
Orders conforming to the report to be prepared by attorney Dan Bacalis within 20 days, 
approved by both attorneys within 5 days, and set for entry ("motion to sign") within 30 
days if no agreement.  
The order filed (March 26, 2024 Temporary Orders) was prepared well past the 
20-day/30-day deadlines – in fact about 44 days later – and by Cooper L. Carter 
(opposing counsel) instead of Dan Bacalis. It was not reviewed or approved by Charles's 
attorney (Bacalis had ceased representing Charles by then), and Charles was pressured to 
sign it immediately on March 26, 2024, under threat of adverse action, rather than being 
given the 5-day review period the Associate Judge had ordered and the parties actually 
had agreed to. 
The March 14, 2024, Associate Judge's Report contains handwritten directives 
written by opposing counsel, not the judge, including a coercive ultimatum that final 
orders must be presented by 1:30 PM that same day. The report notes that Charles 
objected to the form of the proposed order and refused to approve Paragraph 3 – 
evidencing that no true agreement on all terms existed.

This research paper addresses the following central question: Do these procedural 
failures – including non-compliance with the Associate Judge's instructions, lack of 
required signatures/approvals, and coerced "consent" – render the February 1 and March 
14 reports never properly converted into a valid court order, and thus make the March 26, 
2024, Temporary Orders facially void or otherwise invalid? 
The analysis will address the governing law (Texas Family Code provisions, 
Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and case law) and analyze potential due process 
violations. The paper will also discuss remedies, including whether mandamus relief or 
other direct attacks are appropriate to vacate the orders. 
II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
A. February 1, 2024 – Associate Judge's Hearing and Report 
On February 1, 2024, an Associate Judge never heard Petitioner Morgan Myers's 
motion for temporary orders. The purpose of the setting was for Petitioner to produce 
evidence of her family violence claims. According to the Associate Judge's Report for 
Temporary Orders signed that day, both parties appeared with counsel. The report recites 
that Petitioner (Morgan) and Respondent (Charles) "signed an Associate Judge's Report 
regarding Agreed Temporary Orders." In other words, the Associate Judge’s Report for 
Temporary Orders was represented as an agreed order. 
Notably, however, the February 1 report itself was not a final typed order; it was a 
handwritten form that Dan Bacalis, not the Associate Judge, completed. Crucially, at the 
end of the hearing the Associate Judge did not enter a final written order but instead set 
out a procedure to finalize one: 
1. A typed Temporary Order conforming to the Associate Judge's Report was to be 
prepared within 20 days of February 1, 2024. The report explicitly says: "A typed 
written Order conforming to this Report will follow within 20 days from the date 
this Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be prepared by [Dan Bacalis]."

Il. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
A. February 1, 2024 - Associate Judge's Hearing and Report

On February 1, 2024, an Associate Judge never heard Petitioner Morgan Myers's
motion for temporary orders. The purpose of the setting was for Petitioner to produce
evidence of her family violence claims. According to the Associate Judge's Report for
Temporary Orders signed that day, both parties appeared with counsel. The report recites
that Petitioner (Morgan) and Respondent (Charles) "signed an Associate Judge's Report
regarding Agreed Temporary Orders." In other words, the Associate Judge’s Report for

Temporary Orders was represented as an agreed order.

Notably, however, the February 1 report itself was not a final typed order; it was a
handwritten form that Dan Bacalis, not the Associate Judge, completed. Crucially, at the
end of the hearing the Associate Judge did not enter a final written order but instead set

out a procedure to finalize one:

1. Atyped Temporary Order conforming to the Associate Judge's Report was to be
prepared within 20 days of February 1, 2024. The report explicitly says: "A typed
written Order conforming to this Report will follow within 20 days from the date

this Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be prepared by [Dan Bacalis]."

=== PAGE 155 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
2. Each attorney was to approve the order, with 5 days for review. The report states: 
"Each attorney should approve the Order. The parties do not need to approve the 
Order. The attorney reviewing the proposed Order shall have five (5) days to do 
so." Thus, both Morgan's and Charles's attorneys were required to sign off as to 
form; the parties' signatures on the final typed version were not strictly required 
by this instruction (since it says parties "do not need to approve"), but the initial 
report itself contemplated an agreed order and included signature lines for the 
parties as evidence of their agreement. In practice, for an agreed family order it is 
standard that both parties and counsel sign "Approved as to Form and 
Substance." 
3. If the attorneys could not agree on the form of order, a "Motion to Sign" hearing 
was to be set within 30 days of February 1. The report directs: "If an agreement is 
not reached, a Motion to Sign shall be filed and set within thirty (30) days from 
the signing of this Report." This meant by approximately March 2, 2024, any 
dispute about the order's wording or contents should be brought to the court for 
resolution. 
Finally, the February 1 Associate Judge's Report has an "AGREED AS TO FORM 
AND SUBSTANCE" signature block for the parties and attorneys.  
The Associate Judge did sign the report on February 1, making the report effective as 
an interim order of the court. Under Texas Family Code § 201.013, a signed Associate 
Judge's proposed order is in full force and effect pending any request for a de novo 
hearing by the referring court. No request for a de novo hearing was filed by either party 
within the 3-working-day window (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.015(a)). Therefore, the 
Associate Judge's rulings of February 1 became the governing temporary orders in effect 
– but only in the form of the handwritten report, pending entry of the formal typed order. 
B. March 14, 2024 – Attempt to Finalize Order and Second AJ's Report 
By early March 2024, no agreed typed order had been submitted or signed. Dan 
Bacalis (Charles's attorney) did not prepare the order within 20 days, nor was a Motion to

was to be set within 30 days of February 1. The report directs: "Jfan agreement is
not reached, a Motion to Sign shall be filed and set within thirty (30) days from
the signing of this Report." This meant by approximately March 2, 2024, any
dispute about the order's wording or contents should be brought to the court for

resolution.

Finally, the February 1 Associate Judge's Report has an "AGREED AS TO FORM
AND SUBSTANCE’ signature block for the parties and attorneys.

— but only in the form of the handwritten report, pending entry of the formal typed order.
B. March 14, 2024 — Attempt to Finalize Order and Second AJ's Report

By early March 2024, no agreed typed order had been submitted or signed. Dan

Bacalis (Charles's attorney) did not prepare the order within 20 days, nor was a Motion to

M.2179

M.2179

=== PAGE 156 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Sign filed within 30 days. In fact, during this period Charles's counsel was terminated 
from representation just four days after the associate judge’s report was signed on 
February 1. To address the basis for any agreement being fraudulent, Charles promptly 
filed an emergency motion to reconsider evidence and vacate any agreement, which was 
eventually set for March 14 due to Cooper Carter’s availability. 
At the March 14 proceeding, instead of simply holding an entry hearing, the 
court and counsel engaged in off-the-record discussions to get the order finalized. 
Opposing counsel (Cooper Carter) took it upon herself to hand-write the directives on a 
new Associate Judge's Report form. These handwritten notes (penned by Carter, not the 
judge) included a coercive instruction that Charles must sign the final order by 1:30 PM 
that same day (March 14). 
Essentially, Charles was given an ultimatum to immediately acquiesce to the 
written order's terms. The March 14 report also documented that Charles objected to the 
form of the order and specifically did not approve Paragraph 3 (a provision in the draft 
order). In other words, as of March 14 there was not a full meeting of the minds – Charles 
had an unresolved objection to at least one substantive term. Despite this, the pressure 
was on to finalize the order that day, and the purpose of being there was for an entire 
different purpose.  
Importantly, the handwritten March 14 notes were not written by the judge and 
were not traditional judicial findings or rulings – they were more in the nature of 
instructions and a deadline apparently dictated by opposing counsel. There is no 
indication the Associate Judge held an evidentiary hearing on March 14 or made 
independent findings; instead, it appears the goal was simply to force execution of the 
previously "agreed" temporary order that had essentially been nullified by Dan Bacalis’ 
departure from the case.

Sign filed within 30 days. In fact, during this period Charles's counsel was terminated
from representation just four days after the associate judge’s report was signed on
February 1. To address the basis for any agreement being fraudulent, Charles promptly
filed an emergency motion to reconsider evidence and vacate any agreement, which was

eventually set for March 14 due to Cooper Carter’s availability.

At the March 14 proceeding, instead of simply holding an entry hearing, the
court and counsel engaged in off-the-record discussions to get the order finalized.
Opposing counsel (Cooper Carter) took it upon herself to hand-write the directives on a
new Associate Judge's Report form. These handwritten notes (penned by Carter, not the
judge) included a coercive instruction that Charles must sign the final order by 1:30 PM

that same day (March 14).

Essentially, Charles was given an ultimatum to immediately acquiesce to the
written order's terms. The March 14 report also documented that Charles objected to the
form of the order and specifically did not approve Paragraph 3 (a provision in the draft
order). In other words, as of March 14 there was not a full meeting of the minds — Charles
had an unresolved objection to at least one substantive term. Despite this, the pressure
was on to finalize the order that day, and the purpose of being there was for an entire

different purpose.

Importantly, the handwritten March 14 notes were not written by the judge and
were not traditional judicial findings or rulings — they were more in the nature of
instructions and a deadline apparently dictated by opposing counsel. There is no
indication the Associate Judge held an evidentiary hearing on March 14 or made
independent findings; instead, it appears the goal was simply to force execution of the
previously "agreed" temporary order that had essentially been nullified by Dan Bacalis’

departure from the case.

temporary conservatorship, possession, and injunction terms that were discussed back on 
February 1. The key points about this March 26, 2024 Temporary Orders are: 
1. It was drafted by Cooper L. Carter, counsel for Morgan (as evidenced by the 
signature block indicating Carter's authorship and by the fact that Bacalis was no 
longer involved). This violated the Associate Judge's explicit instruction that Dan 
Bacalis would prepare the order. In effect, opposing counsel unilaterally drafted 
the order. 
2. It was prepared and filed well after the 20-day deadline set by the February 1 
report. Nearly two months had elapsed (far beyond the expected February 21 
deadline for drafting and March 2 deadline for a motion to sign). No extension or 
modification of the Associate Judge's timeline was on record. Thus, the order was 
untimely under the terms of the February 1 directive. 
3. Critically, the order was not reviewed or approved by Charles Myers's attorney. 
By the time the order was drafted in late March, Charles had no attorney of 
record (Bacalis did not sign the order and had withdrawn). The February 1 
report's procedure – requiring each attorney to approve within 5 days – became 
impossible to follow, since Charles had no counsel to review the draft. Carter did 
not seek approval from any attorney on Charles's side. In fact, the signature block 
shows Dan Bacalis's signature line blank (he did not sign off because he wasn't 
even on the case). 
4. The March 26 order was presented to Charles for his signature on extremely 
short notice (apparently on the same day). Charles did not sign the order. He was 
essentially confronted with the final order and told to sign immediately (recall the 
March 14 "1:30 PM deadline" threat) or face adverse consequences (the 
implication being the judge would sign it without his consent or possibly hold 
him in contempt or consider him uncooperative). Feeling coerced and with no 
counsel to advise him, Charles signed "Approved and Consented to as to Form 
and Substance" on March 26, 2024 – but this signature was not truly voluntary. It 
was done under protest to avoid an even worse outcome. It is telling that Charles

had explicitly refused to approve the same order's Paragraph 3 on March 14, yet 
by March 26 he capitulated and signed – a strong indicator of coercion rather 
than genuine agreement. 
5. The recitals in the March 26 Temporary Orders are misleading. The order opens 
by reciting that both parties appeared on February 1 and "signed an Associate 
Judge's Report regarding Agreed Temporary Orders", and that "The parties have 
agreed to the terms of this order as evidenced by the signatures below." While 
Morgan and her counsel indeed signed the report, Charles's signature was not on 
that report, so that recital is factually inaccurate. Thus, the very foundation – that 
the order is an agreed order – is incorrect. 
In summary, the March 26, 2024, Temporary Orders were entered following a 
process in which the Associate Judge's explicit procedures were not observed, one party's 
counsel was no longer involved to approve the order, and the other party's consent was 
effectively forced.

District Judge within a short window (generally 3 working days for temporary orders in

order may be adopted and enforced as an order of the district court. In fact, pending any 
de novo request, the associate judge's proposed order is in full effect as an order of the 
court (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.013(a)). This legal mechanism is intended to give 
immediate effect to temporary rulings, while allowing a quick review by the district judge 
if a party is dissatisfied. 
An associate judge has authority to "render and sign... a temporary order" in a 
SAPCR or divorce case. Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007(a)(14)(C) expressly so provides. The 
associate judge can also sign a final order if it is agreed in writing by all parties as to both 
form and substance. In other words, the statute recognizes that a true agreed order (with 
all parties signing off) can be signed by the associate judge and will carry the same 
weight as if the district judge signed it. For contested matters, typically the associate 
judge issues a report and proposed order for the district judge to sign, unless no party 
objects (in which case the associate judge's order often effectively becomes final after the 
de novo period). 
Requirements for Temporary Orders (Tex. Family Code § 105.001) 
Section 105.001 of the Family Code governs temporary orders in suits affecting 
the parent-child relationship. It broadly allows a court to make temporary orders for the 
safety and welfare of the child (e.g., conservatorship, support, restraining certain 
behavior, etc.). However, it also imposes certain procedural safeguards. For example, 
except in emergencies, temporary orders (like those appointing conservators or ordering 
support) can only be issued after notice and a hearing. 
Notably, a temporary order that excludes a parent from possession of or access to 
a child (as happened here, since Charles was forced out of the home and effectively had 
limited access) cannot be rendered without a verified pleading or affidavit showing the 
requisite facts (essentially a showing of immediate danger to the child). This is to ensure 
a parent is not denied access without due process and evidentiary support. In our case, the 
initial February 1 hearing was tied to a protective order application, so there likely were 
affidavits/pleadings on file – but whether evidence was presented is disputed. Regardless, 
the overarching principle is that due process must be afforded in temporary orders.

B. Agreed Orders and Rule 11 
Texas strongly favors parties resolving issues by agreement, but any agreement 
touching a pending lawsuit must satisfy Rule 11, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure to be 
enforceable. Rule 11 requires agreements to be either (1) in writing, signed by the parties 
or their attorneys, and filed with the court, or (2) made on the record in open court. An 
"Agreed Temporary Order" is essentially a Rule 11 agreement on the interim issues, 
incorporated into a court order. If one party does not actually consent or withdraws 
consent before the court renders the order, then there is no valid agreement to support an 
agreed order. 
Texas case law is clear that a court cannot render a valid agreed judgment or 
order without the genuine consent of both parties at the time of rendition. If a party 
revokes consent or never consented in the first place, the agreed judgment is improper. As 
the Texas Supreme Court has held in Burnaman v. Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288 (Tex. 1951), a 
judgment purporting to be a consent judgment, but actually rendered without consent, is 
void. Similarly, in S&A Restaurant Corp. v. Leal, 892 S.W.2d 855, 857 (Tex. 1995), the 
court confirmed that a party may revoke consent any time before judgment is rendered. 
C. Relevant Statutory Provisions and Case Law 
The legal analysis in this paper draws upon the following key statutory provisions 
and case law: 
• 
Texas Family Code § 201.007(a)(14)(C): Authorizes associate judges to render 
and sign temporary orders. 
• 
Texas Family Code § 201.011: Requirements for associate judge's reports. 
• 
Texas Family Code § 201.013: Effect of associate judge's report pending de 
novo hearing. 
• 
Texas Family Code § 201.015(a): Time frame for requesting de novo hearing.

IV. ANALYSIS OF PROCEDURAL IRREGULARITIES 
A. Failure to Follow Associate Judge's Explicit Procedures 
The February 1, 2024 Associate Judge's Report established a clear procedure for 
finalizing the Temporary Orders. This procedure was not followed in several critical 
respects: 
1. Preparation by Wrong Attorney: The Associate Judge explicitly directed that 
Dan Bacalis (Charles's attorney) would prepare the typed order within 20 days. 
Instead, Cooper L. Carter (Morgan's attorney) prepared the order. This is a direct 
contravention of the court's instruction. The court's designation of a specific 
attorney to draft the order was not a mere suggestion but a directive. When a 
court specifies which attorney will draft an order, it is typically to ensure fairness 
and balance in the drafting process. By having opposing counsel draft the order 
instead, the court's intent was undermined, and the resulting document may 
reflect a bias toward Morgan's interests. 
2. Missed Deadlines: The Associate Judge set clear deadlines: 20 days for 
preparation of the typed order (approximately February 21, 2024) and 30 days for 
a Motion to Sign if agreement could not be reached (approximately March 2, 
2024). The final order was not prepared until March 26, 2024 – approximately 54 
days after the February 1 hearing. This delay of nearly two months exceeds both 
deadlines by a substantial margin. No extension of these deadlines appears in the 
record. The court's timeline was not merely advisory; it was a binding directive 
that established the parameters for finalizing the order. The failure to adhere to 
these deadlines constitutes a procedural irregularity that calls into question the 
validity of the resulting order.

A. Failure to Follow Associate Judge's Explicit Procedures

The February 1, 2024 Associate Judge's Report established a clear procedure for

finalizing the Temporary Orders. This procedure was not followed in several critical

3. No Attorney Approval: The Associate Judge directed that each attorney should 
approve the order, with a 5-day review period. By the time the order was 
prepared, Charles no longer had counsel of record. Dan Bacalis had withdrawn 
from representation and did not sign the final order. This means the order was 
never reviewed or approved by an attorney representing Charles's interests, as 
explicitly required by the Associate Judge. The requirement for attorney approval 
serves an important purpose: ensuring that the written order accurately reflects 
what was agreed or ordered at the hearing. Without this safeguard, there is no 
assurance that the final document faithfully represents the court's rulings or any 
agreement between the parties. 
4. No Motion to Sign Hearing: The Associate Judge directed that if agreement 
could not be reached on the form of the order, a Motion to Sign should be filed 
and set within 30 days. No such motion was filed, despite the fact that Charles 
objected to at least one provision (Paragraph 3) of the proposed order on March 
14, 2024. Instead of following this procedure for resolving disagreements, 
opposing counsel and the court apparently attempted to force Charles's 
acquiescence through coercive means. The Motion to Sign procedure is designed 
to provide a formal mechanism for resolving disputes about the form of an order. 
By bypassing this process, the court denied Charles the opportunity to present his 
objections in a proper procedural context. 
These procedural failures are not mere technicalities. They represent significant 
deviations from the court's own directives and from standard legal practice. The 
Associate Judge's instructions were designed to ensure a fair and orderly process for 
finalizing the Temporary Orders. By disregarding these instructions, the parties and the 
court undermined the integrity of the process and cast doubt on the validity of the 
resulting order.

3. No Attorney Approval: The Associate Judge directed that each attorney should
approve the order, with a 5-day review period. By the time the order was
prepared, Charles no longer had counsel of record. Dan Bacalis had withdrawn
from representation and did not sign the final order. This means the order was
never reviewed or approved by an attorney representing Charles's interests, as
explicitly required by the Associate Judge. The requirement for attorney approval
serves an important purpose: ensuring that the written order accurately reflects
what was agreed or ordered at the hearing. Without this safeguard, there is no
assurance that the final document faithfully represents the court's rulings or any

agreement between the parties.

4. No Motion to Sign Hearing: The Associate Judge directed that if agreement
could not be reached on the form of the order, a Motion to Sign should be filed
and set within 30 days. No such motion was filed, despite the fact that Charles

14, 2024. Instead of following this procedure for resolving disagreements,

The March 26, 2024 Temporary Orders purport to be an "Agreed" order, as 
evidenced by the recitals and the signature blocks. However, several factors indicate that 
there was no valid consent to support an agreed order: 
1. Missing Signatures
The March 26, 2024 Associate Judge's Report recites that both parties "signed an 
Associate Judge's Report regarding Agreed Temporary Orders" and that "The parties have 
agreed to the terms of this order as evidenced by the signatures below." However, Charles 
Myers's signature is notably absent from the report. This discrepancy between the recital 
and the actual signatures calls into question whether Charles ever agreed to the terms in 
the first place. 
The absence of Charles's signature on the report is particularly significant 
because the report itself states that the parties' agreement would be "evidenced by [their] 
signatures." Without Charles's signature, there is no evidence of his agreement as 
contemplated by the report itself. This creates a fundamental inconsistency: the document 
claims to be based on an agreement evidenced by signatures, yet one party's signature is 
missing. 
2. Objection Not Resolved
As of March 14, 2024, Charles explicitly objected to Paragraph 3 of the order and 
refused to approve it. This is documented in the March 14 Associate Judge's Report. This 
objection is clear evidence that Charles had not consented to all terms of the would-be 
agreed order. When a party voices an objection to the form or substance of a judgment 
before it is signed, the proper course is for the court to refrain from entering it as an 
agreed judgment. 
In family cases, either party can revoke consent to an agreement any time before 
the judge signs the order. Charles's conduct on March 14 amounted to either a non-
consent or revocation of any prior tentative consent regarding that disputed term. 
Therefore, at that point, the matter ceased to be fully agreed. Under Texas law, the judge 
could only proceed by either obtaining a new agreement or by treating it as a contested

The March 26, 2024 Temporary Orders purport to be an "Agreed" order, as

matter. Forcing the party to sign under threat is not a valid option. If consent is 
withdrawn, the court cannot render an agreed order – doing so is an abuse of discretion 
and the order will be void because one party's consent was lacking at rendition. 
3. Coerced Signature = No Real Consent
Charles's signature on February 1 was obtained under duress. He was effectively 
given an ultimatum: sign immediately or face some unspecified but presumably severe 
consequence. Consent obtained through coercion, threats, or duress is not valid consent. 
In contract law, an agreement signed under duress can be voided. In judgment 
law, a party's forced assent is no assent at all – it is akin to no agreement. Here, Charles 
did not willingly approve the order's substance; he relented to pressure from his own 
counsel. This calls into question the voluntariness of the agreed order. Texas courts have 
noted that agreed judgments are essentially contracts approved by the court. Just as a 
contract signed under duress is voidable, an agreed judgment signed under duress should 
not be given effect. The integrity of the judicial process is undermined if one party is 
bullied into signing a judgment. 
4. Absent Attorney for Charles
Charles was pro se by March 14, without the benefit of counsel to advise him. 
This made him more vulnerable to coercion and means there was no attorney on his side 
agreeing to the order's terms. Morgan's attorney drafted it and of course agreed to it; 
Charles had no attorney to negotiate or ensure fairness. The disparity in representation 
and the rushed nature of the signing further indicate the "agreement" was one-sided. 
Essentially, the March 26 document was Morgan (through her attorney) agreeing with 
herself and getting Charles's signature as a formality. That is not a true meeting of minds. 
Under these circumstances, the March 26 Temporary Orders cannot be 
considered a valid agreed order. It was a unilateral order imposed on Charles with a 
veneer of consent. In Texas, when a judgment is recited as agreed but in fact one party 
did not consent, the remedy is typically to set it aside. For instance, in Samples 
Exterminators, the Texas Supreme Court held the agreed judgment void when one party's

consent was lacking. Likewise, in divorce cases, if one party withdraws consent to a 
mediated settlement, the trial court cannot enter it as a judgment (see Burnaman v. 
Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288 (Tex. 1951) – a decades-old case still often cited for the 
proposition that a judge has no authority to impose an agreement on a party who has 
repudiated it prior to judgment). Here, Charles's actions are tantamount to having never 
truly consented or having repudiated any earlier tentative consent. 
In sum, the final Temporary Orders are built on a false premise of party consent. 
On their face, they recite an agreement and show signatures, but the surrounding record 
shows Charles's signature and his attorney's signature is missing. This kind of 
discrepancy is something an appellate court or any reviewing court would look at with 
great concern. Facially, the order proclaims an agreement that did not actually exist – that 
is a strong indicator of invalidity. A judgment that misstates the existence of an agreement 
is at least voidable, if not void, because the court's authority to render that particular 
agreed judgment was never triggered by an actual agreement of the parties. 
C. Non-Conformance to the Court's Actual Rulings – Possible Substantive Variances 
Another question is whether the March 26 order fails to conform to what the 
Associate Judge ordered on February 1. If the final written order includes provisions that 
were never agreed to or never ruled on by the judge, it is improper. Charles's objection to 
Paragraph 3 suggests he believed that portion of the order was not agreed or not ordered 
on February 1. Indeed, reviewing the text of the Temporary Orders, Paragraph 3 (and 
related provisions) deals with the parents using the "AppClose" program for 
communication and sharing information. It is unclear if this specific requirement was 
discussed on February 1 or if it was an added term Carter inserted in the written draft. 
Often, such app requirements are agreed to by parties or ordered by judges to facilitate 
communication. If Charles objected, perhaps he felt it was beyond what was decided at 
the hearing. 
Furthermore, initially, the Feb 1 report gave Charles access to the family 
residence until March 1, 2024 and took the children out of their own home. On the March 
26 report, the dates suddenly shifted, actually creating a window where nobody would be

inside the home. Perhaps most egregious, is that on March 6th, 2024, prior to this hearing 
being held, Mother locked Father out of the family residence. 
Since the final order went beyond the scope of the February 1 hearing and 
imposed new obligations not covered in the AJ's oral pronouncement, the proper course 
would have been to litigate those terms (or at least for the judge to confirm both sides 
agreed). By unilaterally adding it and forcing Charles's signature, the order contains 
terms to which there was never a true assent or judicial determination. In Texas, a written 
judgment must conform to the court's oral rendition (or the parties' agreement). When it 
does not, that portion of the judgment is subject to being set aside or reformed. Here, we 
lack a transcript of February 1, but given Charles's resistance and the blatant differences 
in the two reports, there is no agreement. That means the final order, at least in part, does 
not reflect the actual "report" of the judge but rather what opposing counsel wanted, 
which is highly prejudicial. 
Additionally, because the final order was delayed, by March 26 the Associate 
Judge did not personally "render" those orders – he had made recommendations on 
February 1, but the actual signing on March 26 was by the Associate Judge. If the District 
Judge signed it believing it was agreed, when in fact it was not, then the District Judge 
was essentially misled. The district court has authority to enter temporary orders after an 
AJ's hearing, but if it's contested, the district court should know it's contested. Here, 
labeling it "Agreed" circumvented any further hearing by the district court. That 
implicates due process again – Charles never had a de novo hearing because it was never 
presented as a contested matter; the "agreed" label short-circuited his ability to get the 
referring court to hear his side. 
In conclusion on this point, the content of the March 26 order exceeds or deviates 
from what was legitimately agreed or ordered on the record, making those portions of the 
order unauthorized. An order that a court had no power to make (because the party didn't 
consent and no evidence was taken on that issue) is invalid. At the very least, it's an abuse 
of discretion to include terms not supported by the hearing. This is another reason the 
order is vulnerable to attack.

D. Due Process Violations and Equity 
Beyond the technical rule violations, the manner in which these temporary orders 
were obtained raises serious due process concerns: 
1. No Meaningful Opportunity to be Heard on Disputed Terms 
Charles was not afforded a real chance to argue against Paragraph 3 or any other 
disputed provision. The March 14 "hearing" was a farce in terms of due process – instead 
of an impartial judge considering his objection, he got an opposing counsel's ultimatum. 
The next step should have been a hearing before the district judge (since the AJ process 
had broken down into disagreement). By never allowing Charles a forum to voice why he 
objected (e.g., the changed dates, incorrect mailing address, etc.), the court denied him 
the basic hearing on that issue. Temporary orders, while expedited, still require that each 
party can present their case on any point of contention. This did not happen. 
 
2. Surprise and Lack of Notice 
The attempted final order was pushed through on March 26 without prior notice 
to Charles of an "entry" setting. Typically, when an order is to be entered, especially if the 
form isn't agreed, the party is entitled to notice when the judge will sign it and what 
version is being submitted. Here, Charles was ambushed with a sign-now scenario. That 
is arguably a violation of local rules or at least the spirit of Rule 305, Texas Rules of Civil 
Procedure, which contemplates notice to all parties of the presentation of a judgment for 
signing if not all parties have approved it. In Page v. Sherrill, the Texas Supreme Court 
voided a temporary custody change that was done ex parte without notice. While our case 
was not ex parte (Charles was physically present), the lack of formal notice and rushing is 
analogous to a notice failure. Due process requires notice reasonably calculated to inform 
the person of the action and an opportunity to respond. Charles's "opportunity" to respond 
was truncated to mere minutes under threat.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Having opposing counsel write the judge's orders (handwritten on the report) is 
irregular. It creates an appearance that the neutral arbiter (the judge) abdicated decision-
making to one side's lawyer. The result is not a product of a court's reasoned decision or 
mutual consent, but essentially the wish list of one party imposed as an order. Courts 
have inherent authority to sign orders, but they should draft or carefully review them – 
not just sign whatever one lawyer puts in front of them without the other's approval. If the 
March 14 report notes were indeed by Carter, the Associate Judge should not have relied 
on those as if they were the AJ's own findings. This informality undermines confidence 
that the order was the result of a fair process. 
 
4. Infringement on Parental Rights without Due Course 
The temporary orders severely restricted Charles's rights (requiring him to leave 
the marital home, giving Mother primary custody, supervising exchanges, etc.). Such 
significant deprivations, even temporarily, demand scrupulous adherence to procedure. 
By cutting procedural corners, the court potentially violated Charles's constitutional right 
to due process. The Texas Family Code's requirement of affidavits for excluding a parent 
(Fam. Code §105.001(c)) is one manifestation of due process protection. If those 
requirements were not strictly met or if the evidence was lacking (Charles alleges no 
evidence was presented on February 1 to justify kicking him out and giving mom full 
custody), that initial order itself was problematic. Compounding that with an improper 
finalization process makes it worse. Essentially, Charles and his children were subject to 
a significant custody determination without the full protections of a proper adversarial 
hearing or a proper agreed resolution – a hybrid worst-of-both: no hearing, and no 
genuine agreement. Such a result is fundamentally unfair. When taken into consideration 
that Charles needed the family home to operate his usual course of business, this makes 
even less sense and raises eyebrows as to how the mother was able to get away with such 
conduct. 
Equity and good conscience would call for such an order to be set aside. Courts 
have the power to vacate interlocutory orders that were improvidently granted or that

correct), to the failure to follow the AJ's procedures, to the coercion in obtaining 
signatures. There is a strong argument that Charles was denied due process, and thus the 
order is voidable on that independent basis. In some circumstances, a due process 
violation can render an order void (for example, an order issued without notice or 
jurisdiction is void). While Charles was present in the case (so jurisdiction over him 
existed), the manner of depriving him of rights without a fair hearing could be deemed 
void as a violation of constitutional due process. This is especially true if we analogize to 
cases where a court had jurisdiction but acted in a way that violated a party's 
constitutional rights – courts have not hesitated to grant mandamus or other relief in such 
scenarios because the usual deference to trial court discretion does not extend to ignoring 
fundamental rights. 
E. Are the March 26, 2024 Temporary Orders Facially Void? 
Considering all the above, we assess whether the final Temporary Orders can be 
deemed facially void (void on their face) or at least voidable and subject to being vacated. 
An order is "void" (as opposed to merely voidable) if the court that rendered it 
lacked jurisdiction or authority or if it violates a fundamental jurisdictional requirement. 
Typically, errors in following procedure make an order voidable (to be corrected on direct 
appeal or by motion), not outright void. However, Texas law provides that agreed 
judgments entered without consent are void because the court had "no power to render" 
an agreed judgment absent an actual agreement. In this case, the 322nd District Court had 
subject matter jurisdiction over the divorce/child case and personal jurisdiction over the 
parties, so jurisdiction in the traditional sense is not at issue. But did the court have 
authority to render the particular order it rendered? That is questionable, because the 
court believed it was entering an agreed temporary order – an act that is only authorized 
if all parties truly agreed. Since Charles's consent was not valid, the court's act of signing 
an agreed order was beyond its lawful authority (it could have held a contested hearing or 
sent it back to the AJ, but it could not force an agreement). Thus, one could argue the

order is void ab initio for lack of the required consent. The face of the order proclaims 
that consent, but the supporting record contradicts it. 
When determining facial voidness, courts normally look at the judgment roll or 
the order itself and related documents. Here, the face of the order contains an internal 
inconsistency: it says both parties agreed and evidenced by signatures, but one attorney's 
signature is missing and we know one party's signature was coerced. Admittedly, 
coercion is an extrinsic fact (not evident solely from the document). However, the 
absence of Charles's attorney's approval is evident from the order itself – any reader can 
see one side's attorney did not sign. That is a facial defect in an "agreed" order. One could 
say the order is void on its face because it recites a non-existent agreement and because it 
was entered in violation of the statute that requires all parties' written agreement for an 
associate judge to sign a final order. (Although a temporary order doesn't require written 
agreement of all parties to be signed by an AJ, in this case the order explicitly relies on 
supposed agreement.) 
Even if a court hesitates to label it "void," it is unquestionably voidable for abuse 
of discretion and should be vacated on a direct attack. The trial court's failure to follow its 
own procedures and the statutory framework is a clear abuse of discretion. Few scenarios 
fit the definition of an abuse of discretion more squarely than a judge signing an order 
that one party's attorney never approved and that one party objected to and only signed 
under threat. The integrity of the order is so compromised that it cannot be allowed to 
stand. 
V. REMEDIES 
A. Vacating the Temporary Orders – Mandamus Relief 
Because these are temporary orders in a family law case, they are not appealable by 
ordinary means. Texas law is clear that temporary orders in family cases cannot be 
challenged by interlocutory appeal. See Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001(e) ("Temporary orders 
rendered under this section are not subject to interlocutory appeal."). Instead, the proper 
vehicle for challenging such orders is a petition for writ of mandamus. Mandamus is an

=== PAGE 172 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
extraordinary remedy that will issue only when (1) the trial court clearly abused its 
discretion and (2) there is no adequate remedy by appeal. 
In this case, both elements for mandamus relief are present: 
1. Clear Abuse of Discretion: As detailed above, the trial court clearly abused its 
discretion by: 
• 
Failing to follow the Associate Judge's explicit procedures for finalizing 
the order 
• 
Entering an "agreed" order without valid consent from both parties 
• 
Allowing procedural irregularities that violated due process 
• 
Permitting coercion to obtain a party's signature 
2. No Adequate Remedy by Appeal: Since temporary orders are not appealable, 
Charles has no adequate remedy by appeal. He would have to wait until a final 
decree is entered to challenge these orders on appeal, by which time the harm 
from the improper temporary orders would be irreparable. The children's living 
arrangements, Charles's access to them, and other important matters would be 
governed by invalid orders for months or even years while the case proceeds to 
final judgment. 
Texas courts have consistently granted mandamus relief in family law cases where 
temporary orders were entered improperly. For example, in In re Stearns, 202 S.W.3d 414 
(Tex. App.–Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, orig. proceeding), the court granted mandamus 
relief where the trial court's temporary orders effectively changed custody without proper 
notice or evidence. Similarly, in Page v. Sherrill, 415 S.W.2d 642 (Tex. 1967), the Texas 
Supreme Court granted mandamus relief where a temporary custody order was issued 
without notice and hearing, violating due process. 
If the order is truly void (as opposed to merely voidable), mandamus relief is even 
more appropriate. As the Texas Supreme Court held in In re Southwestern Bell Tel. Co.,

35 S.W.3d 602, 605 (Tex. 2000), if an order is void, mandamus relief is available without 
showing inadequate remedy by appeal. 
B. Alternative Remedies 
In addition to mandamus relief, Charles might consider the following alternative 
remedies: 
1. Motion to Vacate or Set Aside: Charles could file a motion in the trial court 
asking the judge to vacate or set aside the temporary orders based on the 
procedural irregularities and lack of valid consent. While this approach has the 
advantage of giving the trial court an opportunity to correct its own error, it may 
be less effective if the trial court is unwilling to acknowledge the problems with 
the order. 
2. Motion for Reconsideration or New Trial: Charles could file a motion for 
reconsideration or new trial on the temporary orders. This would allow him to 
present evidence of the procedural irregularities and coercion. However, there is 
no guarantee that the trial court would grant such a motion, and the time for filing 
may have already expired. 
3. Motion for Further Temporary Orders: Charles could file a motion for further 
temporary orders, essentially asking the court to revisit the custody and 
possession arrangements. This would not directly challenge the validity of the 
existing orders but could provide an opportunity to modify them. The 
disadvantage is that it would not address the underlying procedural problems. 
Of these alternatives, mandamus relief is likely the most appropriate and effective 
remedy given the nature of the procedural irregularities and the fact that temporary orders 
are not appealable. A petition for writ of mandamus would allow an appellate court to 
review the process by which the temporary orders were obtained and, if appropriate, to 
vacate them and direct the trial court to conduct proper proceedings.

The procedural irregularities surrounding the March 26, 2024 Temporary Orders in Cause 
No. 322-744263-23 raise serious questions about their validity. The evidence 
demonstrates multiple significant deviations from proper legal procedure, including: 
1. Failure to follow the Associate Judge's explicit instructions regarding who would 
prepare the order, the timeline for preparation, and the requirement for attorney 
approval; 
2. Lack of valid consent to support an "agreed" order, as evidenced by Charles's 
missing signature on the February 1 report, his explicit objection to Paragraph 3 
on March 14, the coerced nature of his signature on March 26, and the absence of 
his attorney's approval; 
3. Potential non-conformance between the final written order and what was actually 
ordered or agreed to at the February 1 hearing; 
4. Due process violations, including the denial of a meaningful opportunity to be 
heard on disputed terms, lack of proper notice, irregularities in the process, and 
significant infringement on parental rights without proper procedural safeguards. 
These procedural failures are not mere technicalities. They strike at the heart of the 
judicial process and the fundamental fairness that must characterize court proceedings. 
When a court order purports to be based on the agreement of the parties, but one party's 
consent was obtained through coercion or was never actually given, the integrity of the 
judicial system is compromised. 
The March 26, 2024 Temporary Orders are, at minimum, voidable due to the clear 
abuse of discretion in their entry. There is a strong argument that they are void on their 
face because they recite an agreement that did not exist and because the court lacked 
authority to enter an agreed order without genuine consent from both parties. 
Given the non-appealable nature of temporary orders in family cases, mandamus 
relief is the appropriate remedy. Charles should consider filing a petition for writ of 
mandamus asking the appellate court to vacate the temporary orders and direct the trial

ISSUES PRESENTED FOR RECONSIDERATION 
 
Rehearing Issue No. 1: 
The Texas Supreme Court has held that consolidation constitutes an abuse of 
discretion when it prejudices a party or misjudges the relatedness of actions. 
The panel erred by denying mandamus relief and allowing to stand a sua 
sponte consolidation order that prejudiced Relator by delaying urgent child 
custody proceedings, eliminating strategic advantages, pre-empted appellate 
review, generated further procedural confusion. 
 
 
Rehearing Issue No. 2: 
When the record demonstrates that separate proceedings are necessary to 
prevent manifest injustice, the trial court has a duty to avoid consolidation. 
The panel erred by overlooking the manifest injustice resulting from the trial 
court’s sua sponte consolidation, which violated due process by ignoring a 
pending Rule 12 motion and written objection, and introduced further 
procedural irregularities into already strained litigation.

TO THE HONORABLE SECOND COURT OF APPEALS: 
Relator CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS respectfully moves this Honorable 
Court for en banc reconsideration of the panel decisions rendered in three separate 
but interwoven mandamus proceedings to be presented for reconsideration in the 
following order: 
i. Cause No. 02-25-00166-CV (denied April 14, 2025) (“Void Order”) 
ii. Cause No. 02-25-00171-CV (denied April 17, 2025) (“Consolidation”) 
iii. Cause No. 02-25-00164-CV (denied April 11, 2025) (“SAPCR/TRO”) 
 
This motion serves as the second filed reconsideration motion and addresses 
the panel’s denial of Cause No. 02-25-00171-CV (attached as Tab 1), referred to as 
the “Consolidation” mandamus.   
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT  
This motion satisfies the stringent standards for en banc reconsideration 
under Tex. R. App. P. 41.2(c) because the panel’s denial conflicts with controlling 
precedent and overlooks critical facts in the mandamus record. The trial court 
abused its discretion by sua sponte consolidating Relator’s SAPCR with a stalled 
divorce case on April 11, 2025, without notice, hearing, or consideration of 
Relator’s objection and pending Rule 12 motion. This consolidation prejudiced 
Relator by delaying urgent child custody and support resolutions, eliminating 
strategic advantages, pre-empted appellate review, and caused further procedural 
confusion, violating Tex. R. Civ. P. 174(a) and Tex. Fam. Code § 153 .002. The

TO THE HONORABLE SECOND COURT OF APPEALS:

Relator CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS respectfully moves this Honorable
Court for en banc reconsideration of the panel decisions rendered in three separate
but interwoven mandamus proceedings to be presented for reconsideration in the
following order:

i. Cause No. 02-25-00166-CV (denied April 14, 2025) (“Void Order’)
ii. Cause No. 02-25-00171-CV (denied April 17, 2025) (“Consolidation”)
iii. Cause No. 02-25-00164-CV (denied April 11, 2025) (““SAPCR/TRO”)

This motion serves as the second filed reconsideration motion and addresses
the panel’s denial of Cause No. 02-25-00171-CV (attached as Tab 1), referred to as
the “Consolidation” mandamus.

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

This motion satisfies the stringent standards for en banc reconsideration
under Tex. R. App. P. 41.2(c) because the panel’s denial conflicts with controlling
precedent and overlooks critical facts in the mandamus record. The trial court
abused its discretion by sua sponte consolidating Relator’s SAPCR with a stalled
divorce case on April 11, 2025, without notice, hearing, or consideration of
Relator’s objection and pending Rule 12 motion. This consolidation prejudiced
Relator by delaying urgent child custody and support resolutions, eliminating
strategic advantages, pre-empted appellate review, and caused further procedural

confusion, violating Tex. R. Civ. P. 174(a) and Tex. Fam. Code § 153 .002. The

panel’s denial conflicts with Womack v. Berry, 291 S.W.2d 677 (Tex. 1956), Dal-
Briar Corp. v. Baskette, 833 S.W.2d 612 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1992), and Lone Star 
Ford, Inc. v. McCormick, 838 S.W.2d 734 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1992), 
which emphasize that consolidation must not prejudice a party. En banc review is 
essential to ensure uniformity in family law and protect the children’s best 
interests. 
ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITY 
I. 
En banc reconsideration is warranted under Rule 41.2(c) due to 
extraordinary circumstances and the need for uniformity. 
 
En banc reconsideration is appropriate when a panel’s decision conflicts 
with controlling authority or involves an issue of exceptional importance. Tex. R. 
App. P. 41.2(c); In re Marriage of Harrison, 507 S.W.3d 259, 260 (Tex. App.—
[14th Dist.] April 26, 2016, order) as corrected May 10, 2016 (Frost, J., dissenting 
to partial grant of en banc reconsideration). This matter meets both criteria. 
The panel’s per curiam denial on April 17, 2025, conflicts with Texas 
Supreme Court precedent requiring trial courts to exercise discretion within 
guiding rules and principles. Womack v. Berry, 291 S.W.2d 677, 683 (Tex. 1956) 
(mandamus appropriate to correct clear abuse of discretion in trial management). 
The consolidation delays critical child custody and support determinations, 
undermining Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002, which mandates that “the best interest of

the child shall always be the primary consideration of the court in determining the 
issues of conservatorship and possession of and access to the child”. Allowing trial 
courts to consolidate cases sua sponte without addressing objections or pending 
motions sets a dangerous precedent in family law, where procedural fairness is 
paramount. En banc review is necessary to maintain uniformity and protect the 
children’s welfare. 
II. 
The panel’s denial conflicts with controlling authority and overlooks 
critical facts established in the mandamus record. 
The panel’s denial fails to recognize the trial court’s abuse of discretion and 
the resulting prejudice, as evidenced by the mandamus record and established 
Texas law. 
A. The trial court abused its discretion by consolidating without sound legal 
basis. 
 
Tex. R. Civ. P. 174(a) permits consolidation only when cases share common 
questions of law or fact and when it does not prejudice any party. The trial court’s 
sua sponte consolidation of Relator’s SAPCR with an unprosecuted divorce case 
lacks a sound legal basis and contravenes this rule. In Dal-Briar Corp. v. Baskette, 
833 S.W.2d 612, 615 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1992, no writ), the court held that 
consolidation constitutes an abuse of discretion if it prejudices a party, such as by 
delaying urgent proceedings or creating procedural confusion. Here, the

consolidation delays time-sensitive child custody and support decisions, directly 
undermining Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002. For example, the SAPCR’s unresolved 
custody issues, critical to the children’s stability, are stalled by the divorce case’s 
procedural complexities, causing ongoing harm to their welfare.  
Furthermore, in Lone Star Ford, Inc. v. McCormick, 838 S.W.2d 734, 737 
(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1992, writ denied), the court affirmed that while 
trial courts have broad discretion to consolidate cases with common issues, such 
discretion is abused if consolidation results in prejudice to a party. In that case, the 
court found no abuse because the appellant failed to demonstrate prejudice, noting, 
“Appellant failed to demonstrate how it was prejudiced as a result of 
consolidation.” Id. at 738.  In contrast, here, the consolidation has caused 
significant prejudice by delaying urgent child custody and support resolutions, 
which are time-sensitive and critical to the children’s welfare under Tex. Fam. 
Code § 153.002. This delay distinguishes the present case from Lone Star Ford and 
underscores the trial court’s abuse of discretion, as the issues still remain 
unadjudicated. 
Moreover, Womack v. Berry, 291 S.W.2d at 683, establishes that mandamus 
relief is appropriate when a trial court abuses its discretion to a party’s detriment, 
such as through improper trial management. Although Womack addressed separate 
trials, its principle applies analogously to consolidation decisions that prejudice a

party. The trial court’s failure to demonstrate common questions justifying 
consolidation, coupled with its disregard for the prejudice caused by delay, 
constitutes a clear abuse of discretion. See also Guar. Fed. Sav. Bank v. Horseshoe 
Operating Co., 793 S.W.2d 652, 658 (Tex. 1990) (trial court discretion in 
consolidation is not unbounded). The panel’s denial overlooks these precedents, 
allowing an unsupported consolidation to stand. 
B. The sua sponte consolidation resulted in prejudice and violated due 
process. 
The trial court’s consolidation order, issued without notice or hearing, 
violated Relator’s due process rights by ignoring a pending Tex. R. Civ. P. 12 
motion challenging the Real Party’s counsel’s authority and Relator’s objection to 
consolidation. (MR 7, MR 9) In Crestway Care Center, Inc. v. Berchelmann, 945 
S.W.2d 872, 873 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1997, orig. proceeding), the court 
emphasized that significant procedural actions, like consolidation, require clarity 
and proper documentation to ensure fair review. Here, the trial court’s failure to 
provide notice or a hearing—despite Relator’s objection (MR 9.1, MR 12.32) and 
pending Rule 12 motion (MR 7)—created procedural irregularities.  Moreover, 
Tex. R. Civ. P. 12 requires an attorney to demonstrate authority when challenged, 
and the trial court’s failure to resolve this motion risks validating actions by 
potentially unauthorized counsel, creating a procedural quagmire.

party. The trial court’s failure to demonstrate common questions justifying
consolidation, coupled with its disregard for the prejudice caused by delay,
constitutes a clear abuse of discretion. See also Guar. Fed. Sav. Bank v. Horseshoe
Operating Co., 793 S.W.2d 652, 658 (Tex. 1990) (trial court discretion in
consolidation is not unbounded). The panel’s denial overlooks these precedents,

allowing an unsupported consolidation to stand.

B. The sua sponte consolidation resulted in prejudice and violated due
process.

The trial court’s consolidation order, issued without notice or hearing,
violated Relator’s due process rights by ignoring a pending Tex. R. Civ. P. 12
motion challenging the Real Party’s counsel’s authority and Relator’s objection to
consolidation. (MR 7, MR 9) In Crestway Care Center, Inc. v. Berchelmann, 945

This consolidation action prejudiced Relator in four critical ways: (1) 
delaying urgent child custody and support resolutions that remain unopposed, 
causing further harm to the children’s welfare; (2) eliminating strategic advantages 
in the SAPCR court; (3) causing procedural confusion by merging distinct legal 
issues; and (4) thwarted Relator’s attempt at seeking mandamus relief. These 
impacts mirror the prejudice in Dal-Briar Corp. v. Baskette, where consolidation 
harmed a party’s ability to pursue timely relief. The Real Party’s counsel’s failure 
to respond to this appeal further underscores the procedural irregularities. By 
upholding the trial court’s order, the panel’s denial conflicts with these authorities 
and fails to address the manifest injustice inflicted on Relator and the affected 
children. 
These impacts mirror the prejudice in Dal-Briar Corp. v. Baskette, where 
consolidation harmed a party’s ability to pursue timely relief, and contrast with 
Lone Star Ford, where no prejudice was found. The Real Party’s counsel’s non-
participation at the trial court level further underscores the procedural 
irregularities, as it leaves the Rule 12 challenge unaddressed. By upholding the 
trial court’s order, the panel’s denial conflicts with these authorities and fails to 
address the manifest injustice inflicted on the Relator and the affected children, 
who remain left without an adequate remedy for an appeal.

CONCLUSION AND PRAYER 
The trial court’s sua sponte consolidation order of April 11, 2025, is not 
merely erroneous—it is procedurally indefensible. By consolidating Relator’s 
SAPCR with a stalled divorce case without notice, hearing, or resolution of a 
pending Rule 12 motion and objection, the court flouted due process and Texas 
Family Code § 153.002’s mandate to prioritize children’s best interests. The 
pending Rule 12 motion challenged the Real Party’s counsel’s authority, yet the 
court and Real Party proceeded as if no question existed, risking the validity of 
every subsequent action. This illogic is akin to building a house on a contested 
foundation, inviting collapse.   
Relator prays that this Court grant en banc reconsideration, withdraw or 
otherwise vacate the panel’s denial, and issue mandamus relief compelling the 
Respondent to vacate the consolidation order. Such relief will restore procedural 
fairness, protect constitutional rights, and ensure the children’s best interests are 
not sacrificed to judicial expediency.

Current issues 
 
Currently, there are several issues that remain unaddressed that need to be resolved: 
1. The entire case foundation is fraudulent due to Petitioner’s pleadings. 
2. The undersigned has sought relief from this situation since March 14, 2024, 
when the original orders issued on January 16, 2024, which removed the 
undersigned from his home without the required findings, were leveraged into 
a settlement agreement that was not consented to by all of the parties and did 
not serve the best interests of the children. 
3. COOPER L. CARTER’s authority remains in question, and her inactivity 
combined with the ambiguity surrounding her representation must be 
addressed. 
4. The undersigned has been forced to live in transient housing and incur 
extraordinary damages to his business operations due to the Petitioners 
fraudulent allegations which were never supported by evidence. 
5. The children in this matter continue to suffer ongoing and irreparable harm 
from being separated from their father unjustifiably. 
6. There is no child support set up for the children. 
Informal service 
 
Furthermore, the court continues to issue notices informally through the court 
coordinator, which is improper.

service if the email address is on file with the EFM. Texas courts have consistently held that 
electronic service must be made through the EFM when the recipient's email address is 
registered there. The undersigned’s email is registered with the EFM. 
Conclusion 
 
Because the undersigned has an email on file with the EFM, there is no court order 
requiring alternative service, and there is no agreement waiving formal service, any notice of 
court proceedings not in compliance with rule 21a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure is 
improper.  
 
Furthermore, because there are several issues that remain unaddressed, such as COOPER 
CARTER’S authority, the ongoing mandamus proceedings, the ongoing irreparable harm to the 
children, and the facially void orders which have caused detrimental effects to the undersigned, 
the risk of these issues creating future delays remains high. 
 
The undersigned is prepared to challenge any adverse actions taken against him in the 
face of these issues and will seek relief until this matter is resolved in accordance with the 
principles of fairness and justice. The undersigned requests that the court stay all future 
proceedings until the above matters are resolved.

ARGUMENT 
A. Mandamus Standard
Mandamus relief is warranted when the trial court clearly abused its 
discretion, and the Relator (“Mr. Myers”), has no adequate appellate remedy. In re 
Coppola, 535 S.W.3d 506, 508 (Tex. 2017) (orig. proceeding) (per curiam). “A 
trial court clearly abuses its discretion if ‘it reaches a decision so arbitrary and 
unreasonable as to amount to a clear and prejudicial error of law' [or if it clearly 
fails] to analyze or apply the law correctly ․” Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 
839–40 (Tex. 2006) (orig. proceeding) (quoting Johnson v. Fourth Court of 
Appeals, 700 S.W.2d 916, 917 (Tex. 1985), disapproved of on other grounds by In 
re Columbia Med. Ctr. of Las Colinas, Subsidiary, L.P., 290 S.W.3d 204 (Tex. 
2009)). In any event, as shown in the next section, appeal is no remedy at all under 
these urgent circumstances. 
B. Consolidation and EX-Parte Procedure
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 174(a) permits consolidation of actions that 
involve common questions of law or fact. (APP 6.1) See also Lone Star Ford, Inc. v. 
McCormick, 838 S.W.2d 734, 737 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1992, writ 
denied). A trial court cannot arbitrarily consolidate cases in a manner that 
prejudices one of the parties. Even when consolidation is permissible in principle, 
the court must balance judicial convenience against any risk of unfair prejudice or

confusion, and it must respect the parties’ right to be heard on the issue. Crestway 
Care Ctr., Inc. v. Berchelmann, 945 S.W.2d 872, 874 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 
1997, orig. proceeding) (en banc). Consolidation decisions are reviewed for abuse 
of discretion, and “a trial court may abuse its discretion by … consolidating cases 
when the consolidation results in prejudice to the complaining party.” (citing Lone 
Star Ford, 838 S.W.2d at 738)  
In other words, when deciding whether to consolidate, the trial court must 
balance the judicial economy and convenience that may be gained by the 
consolidation against the risk of an unfair outcome because of prejudice. See Dal-
Briar, 833 S.W.2d at 615. Even if the cases share common questions of law and 
fact, an abuse of discretion may be found if the consolidation results in 
prejudice to the complaining party. Lone Star Ford, Inc., 838 S.W.2d at 738. 
Here, that is precisely what occurred. Mr. Myers has three concurrent 
mandamuses now before this court, and cause number 02-25-00164-CV, (“the 
TRO/SAPCR mandamus”) sought emergency relief in March 2025. (MR 8.2) The 
court’s procedural handling of his Application for Temporary Restraining Order

rules.

irreparable injury will occur before notice can be given. Even when an ex parte 
TRO is justified, TRCP 680 requires the order to be narrowly time-limited (14 
days) and promptly set for hearing on a temporary injunction. (APP 7) Here, Mr. 
Myers followed the rules by giving notice to the opposing party and coordinating 
with the Court for a presentation of his TRO. (MR 12.1-12.9) Tarrant County Local

Notably, on March 27, 2025, the Court (through its coordinator) insisted that 
Mr. Myers appear in person to present the TRO and inform opposing counsel of the 
scheduled time. The coordinator wrote:  
“This order needs to be presented in person. Likewise, you need to inform opposing 
counsel of the date and time you intend to present this order to the court.” (MR 12.9) 
Mr. Myers promptly complied. He emailed Ms. Allison on March 27 
confirming that he had informed the opposing counsel of the intended presentation 
at 9:00 a.m. the following day and that he would update both the Court and 
opposing party if anything changed. (MR 12.9) 
After receiving no response from either the opposing counsel or real party in

in Parker County and is unable to attend. However, I will be available by cell phone regarding 
this matter if the Judge would like to speak to me regarding the Emergency TRO. Please 
contact our office to patch me in for any calls that Judge would like to have.” (MR 12.20) 
and most critically, the opposing counsel went on to say: 
“Additionally, this case already is pending in the 322nd for a divorce proceeding 
regarding property and children matters. We will be consolidating the case and walking it 
through the 322nd for signature next week.” (MR 12.20) 
The following morning, Mr. Myers made an appearance, as confirmed by the 
coordinator.  
“Mr. Myers appeared before me to schedule the hearing for the TRO; my apologies I did 
not realize this was that same case.  We can go ahead and set the TRO with us, but most 
likely the case will be transferred prior to the hearing date and the case needs to be 
transferred prior to that date. Mr. Myers will be emailing with dates available for the

This was followed by the following email: 
“Additionally, since there is an objection to the consolidation, y’all will need to reach out 
to request how to proceed

threshold matters should have came second to the best interests of the children. See 
Tex. Fam. Code 153.002. (APP 5) 
That statement – “I did not realize this was that same case” (MR 12.24)  – is a 
stunning acknowledgment of a procedural lapse. It indicates that the Court failed to 
connect the dots that Mr. Myers’ new case concerning the child was related to the 
ongoing divorce case. As a result, instead of promptly hearing Mr. Myers TRO on 
its merits, the Court stalled and immediately contemplated moving the case away, 
leaving Mr. Myers’ emergency request in limbo. The only individuals who 
followed proper procedure here were the undersigned and the court coordinator, 
non-licensed individuals. (MR 12.24)  
In summary, the procedure leading up to Respondent’s abuse of discretion 
was an abuse of discretion itself, warranting the “TRO/SAPCR Mandamus” that 
was denied per curiam without any substance. (APP 4) 
It was made very clear by the 233rd court that the consolidation motion filed 
by the opposing party on March 20, 2025, was filed in the incorrect court. (MR 5) 
(MR 12.17) This was used against Mr. Myers at the 11th hour to prevent the TRO 
hearing, as shown above. The forward-looking consolidation motion that was used 
to justify denying Mr. Myers his day in court was filed by RODERICK D. MARX, 
a non-party in either the SAPCR suit or the divorce matter on April 3, 2025. (MR

Shortly thereafter, the opposing counsel emailed Mr. Myers stating: 
“This is to inform you that I will be walking through the attached Motion for 
Consolidation and Proposed Order tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m. in the 322nd for 
signature.” (MR 12.31) 
Mr. Myers promptly replied, stating: 
“I've already objected. 
You have no legal authority to do so until you address my objection filed and 
served to you.” (MR 12.32) 
This procedural gamesmanship is the exact reason why the undersigned opened a 
new SAPCR, as it has left the divorce to languish outside of one-sided attempts to 
pursue relief, as clearly pointed out in his pleadings. There has been no meaningful 
discussion on the merits of this matter with the opposing side and no attempt to 
prosecute outside of the latest stunt to block emergency relief. (MR 1.1) From 
there, Mr. Myers filed a NOTICE OF INTENT TO SEEK MANDAMUS RELIEF 
in the 233rd (MR 14) and began preparing his first mandamus brief, which was 
submitted to this court on April 10, 2024.

C. ABUSE OF DISCRETION
Immediately after submitting his first mandamus petition, Mr. Myers was 
served with an ORDER GRANTING CONSOLIDATION. (MR 15) This motion, 
which was used as a barrier to relief, was granted sua sponte by the same court 
who just declined to hear an emergency TRO before it. 
The record leaves no doubt that Respondent’s decision to consolidate the 
cases without notice or a hearing was a gross departure from the fair administration 
of justice. It is difficult to imagine a more textbook abuse of discretion: a contested 
motion was granted sua sponte, with no opportunity for the opposing party to be 
heard. This is not a close call or a minor procedural wrinkle. The facts speak for 
themselves – equity, due process, and basic procedural fairness were all denied in 
one fell swoop. The only question is whether they will continue to be ignored. 
Texas courts have held that a trial court clearly abuses its discretion by 
granting a contested motion sua sponte without providing notice or a hearing. In 
D.A. Buckner Constr., Inc. v. Hobson, for example, the trial judge entered an order
(imposing sanctions) even though the affected party had no notice or opportunity to 
be heard. The court of appeals declared that order void and emphatically stated: 
“Respondent’s order was without notice or hearing. Under these circumstances, the 
trial court’s order is void, and mandamus will lie to vacate such an order.” Such is 
the case here. Therefore, the law should apply equally.

C. ABUSE OF DISCRETION

Immediately after submitting his first mandamus petition, Mr. Myers was
served with an ORDER GRANTING CONSOLIDATION. (MR 15) This motion,
which was used as a barrier to relief, was granted sua sponte by the same court
who just declined to hear an emergency TRO before it.

The record leaves no doubt that Respondent’s decision to consolidate the
cases without notice or a hearing was a gross departure from the fair administration
of justice. It is difficult to imagine a more textbook abuse of discretion: a contested
motion was granted sua sponte, with no opportunity for the opposing party to be
heard. This is not a close call or a minor procedural wrinkle. The facts speak for
themselves — equity, due process, and basic procedural fairness were all denied in
one fell swoop. The only question is whether they will continue to be ignored.

D. NO ADEQUATE REMEDY 
In determining whether an appeal is an adequate remedy, courts have 
weighed the benefits over the detriments. In re BP Prods. N. Am., Inc., 244 S.W.3d 
840, 845 (Tex.2008) (orig.proceeding).  A party establishes that no adequate 
appellate remedy exists by showing it is in real danger of losing its substantial 
rights. Perry v. Del Rio, 66 S.W.3d 239, 257 (Tex.2001) (orig.proceeding). As 
repeatedly stated throughout these proceedings, Relator has been deprived of the 
most fundamental rights one can have: the right to possess and protect his home, 
and the right to care for, maintain contact with, and make decisions regarding his 
minor children. These rights are not abstract — they are protected by the U.S. 
Constitution, the Texas Constitution, and longstanding precedent. 
E. ONGOING AND IRREPARABLE HARM 
The Texas Supreme Court has repeatedly reaffirmed that “a parent’s rights to 
the care, custody, and control of their children are constitutional in nature and must 
be afforded heightened protection.” In re C.J.C., 603 S.W.3d 804, 809 (Tex. 2020). 
Likewise, property rights — including the right to remain in and possess one’s 
home — are protected under Article I, Section 19 of the Texas Constitution and the 
Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. See also University of Tex. Med. 
Branch v. Than, 901 S.W.2d 926, 930 (Tex. 1995)

When such rights are denied without valid order, hearing, or opportunity to 
be heard — as occurred here — the violation is not merely procedural: it is a 
constitutional injury, and one that warrants immediate mandamus relief. For all 
reasons incorporated herein, Mandamus should be issued, as deprivation is 
ongoing, and will occur until justice is rightfully served. 
Relator has clearly established the Respondent’s consolidation was both 
procedurally improper, and prejudicial. For all reasons incorporated herein, the 
court should uphold Texas precedent, and issue mandamus relief to restore justice 
to these proceedings. 
CONCLUSION 
With a prima facie showing of systemic abuse laid bare across the trilogy of 
mandamus petitions now before this Court, it is no longer credible to characterize 
the lower court’s conduct as isolated error. Two of the three heads of this 
procedural dragon—embodied by the 233rd, the 322nd, and this very Court—have 
already rendered per curiam denials, offering no explanation in the face of 
documented, unrebutted misconduct. The record in each petition stands 
unopposed. No adversary response has been filed. No evidentiary challenge has 
been made. The silence against Relator’s claims is not merely strategic—it is 
telling. A dangerous precedent is being forged in silence. This court must act.

PRAYER 
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Relator CHARLES DUSTIN 
MYERS respectfully prays that this Honorable Court: 
1. Issue a writ of mandamus compelling the Hon. Kenneth Newell, Judge of
the 233rd District Court, to vacate the April 2025 consolidation order, as it
was entered sua sponte on a contested motion;
2. Take judicial notice of the procedural irregularities and record-supported
adversity faced by Relator throughout these proceedings, including the
refusal to hear his emergency TRO while simultaneously granting relief to
the opposing party;
3. Grant all other relief to which Relator may be justly entitled, at law or in
equity, in light of the extraordinary circumstances and ongoing deprivation
of due process.
Relator has before this Court three petitions for writ of mandamus. Two have
already been denied per curiam without explanation—perhaps the result of routine 
disregard for pro se filings. But on rehearing, this Court is urged to evaluate this 
petition in conjunction with its sister mandamuses to fully grasp the depth of 
systemic abuse, procedural evasion, and judicial inconsistency present in the courts 
below.

Re: Original Petition in Suit Affecting Parent-Child Relationship (“SAPCR”) – Request to 
File as Separate Case and Set Immediate Hearing (In the Interest of [M.M.] and [C.M.], 
minor children; related to Cause No. 322-744263-23, In re Marriage of Myers) 
Dear Mr. Wilder and Honorable Court: 
Please accept for filing the enclosed Original SAPCR concerning the above-referenced 
children. This SAPCR is intentionally filed as a new, separate case, rather than under the 
existing divorce cause, due to unique procedural defects in that divorce proceeding that have left 
the children in legal and physical limbo. Immediate intervention is required to protect the 
children’s best interests. Below, I outline the compelling reasons – supported by law and the 
record – why this SAPCR must proceed separately and be set for an emergency hearing at 
once, instead of being merged into the stalled divorce case. 
A. Failure of Opposing Party to Prosecute
1. The divorce Petitioner has wholly failed to prosecute the divorce, leaving it in
procedural limbo. Over a year has passed with no meaningful activity toward a final resolution. 
Notably, after the divorce case was removed to federal court and later remanded, Petitioner 
never filed the required certified Order of Remand or gave notice of remand as mandated by 
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 237a. Rule 237a obligates the removing party to promptly file the 
federal remand order with the state clerk and notify all parties, after which any defendant has 15 
days to answer. Petitioner’s omission of this required step has left the state court record 
incomplete and the case procedurally suspended. Indeed, due to Petitioner’s inaction (and her

Re: Original Petition in Suit Affecting Parent-Child Relationship (““SAPCR”’) — Request to
File as Separate Case and Set Immediate Hearing (In the Interest of [M.M.] and [C.M.],
minor children; related to Cause No. 322-744263-23, In re Marriage of Myers)

Dear Mr. Wilder and Honorable Court:

Please accept for filing the enclosed Original SAPCR concerning the above-referenced
children. This SAPCR is intentionally filed as a new, separate case, rather than under the
existing divorce cause, due to unique procedural defects in that divorce proceeding that have left
the children in legal and physical limbo. Immediate intervention is required to protect the
children’s best interests. Below, I outline the compelling reasons — supported by law and the
record — why this SAPCR must proceed separately and be set for an emergency hearing at

once, instead of being merged into the stalled divorce case.
A. Failure of Opposing Party to Prosecute

1. The divorce Petitioner has wholly failed to prosecute the divorce, leaving it in
procedural limbo. Over a year has passed with no meaningful activity toward a final resolution.
Notably, after the divorce case was removed to federal court and later remanded, Petitioner
never filed the required certified Order of Remand or gave notice of remand as mandated by
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 237a. Rule 237a obligates the removing party to promptly file the
federal remand order with the state clerk and notify all parties, after which any defendant has 15
days to answer. Petitioner’s omission of this required step has left the state court record

incomplete and the case procedurally suspended. Indeed, due to Petitioner’s inaction (and her

M.2260

=== PAGE 237 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
counsel’s apparent inability to e-file; see Point 8 below), no remand notice was ever filed, so 
the divorce court has not resumed jurisdiction in any practical sense. 
2. In addition, Petitioner has ignored the Texas Supreme Court’s time standards for
timely disposition of cases. A divorce case is expected to be resolved within 12 months, yet 
Petitioner has made no effort to advance it. She has not set a trial or even a status conference; she 
has allowed critical deadlines to lapse. This lack of diligence violates the duty to prosecute one’s 
claims and warrants dismissal for want of prosecution. In fact, Respondent has been forced to 
file a Motion to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution (pending before the Court) detailing 
Petitioner’s complete failure to move the case forward. This also remains un-responded to. 
Petitioner’s inaction has left the family with no active forum to address urgent child-related 
issues. Therefore, a separate SAPCR is necessary to provide a functioning vehicle for relief. 
The children cannot wait for the Petitioner’s indifference or strategic delay to abate. 
B. Failure to Oppose Any Relief (Legal Concession)
3. Throughout the divorce case, Petitioner has not opposed or responded to any of
Respondent’s filings, motions, or claims for relief. She and her counsel have remained silent in 
the face of serious allegations and requests, effectively conceding the merits of those issues 
under Texas law. Respondent has raised grave claims of fraud, perjury, deception, and child 
neglect against Petitioner in his pleadings, yet Petitioner’s counsel has filed no response or 
defense to these claims. Respondent also served discovery and Requests for Admissions which 
went completely unanswered, resulting in deemed admissions. He even filed a motion to 
compel discovery, which Petitioner again did not oppose, though unfortunately no hearing has 
yet been held. Moreover, when Respondent moved for other interim relief (including return to 
the family home and expanded access to the children), Petitioner filed no opposition. By her

inaction, Petitioner has implicitly admitted the validity of Respondent’s factual assertions and 
the justness of his requests.  
4. Texas law is clear that a party who fails to respond to motions or claims effectively
waives any objection and accepts the movant’s evidence as true. For example, in the 
summary judgment context, if a nonmovant files no response, the court may accept the movant’s 
asserted facts as uncontroverted and render judgment if entitlement is shown; issues not timely 
raised in a written response are waived; see Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c). The same principle applies 
here: Petitioner’s total failure to contest Respondent’s filings is tantamount to a legal concession 
of those matters. In other words, failure to make timely and specific objections results in waiver 
of the objections. See Clark v. Trailways, Inc., 774 S.W.2d 644, 647 (Tex. 1989), cert. denied, 
493 U.S. 1074, 110 S.Ct. 1122, 107 L.Ed.2d 1028 (1990); Hartford Accident and Indem. Co. v. 
McCardell, 369 S.W.2d 331, 335 (Tex. 1963); Srite v. Owens-Illinois, Inc., 870 S.W.2d 556, 565 
(Tex.App. — Houston [1st Dist.] 1993), revised on other grounds, 897 S.W.2d 765). Courts have 
recognized that a party’s failure to respond indicates a belief that the motion has merit.  
5. Petitioner’s silence speaks volumes. She has never disputed that Respondent should be
allowed to return home or see his children – in fact, she has not opposed any relief requested. 
This silence should be treated as acquiescence. Accordingly, there is no reason to keep the 
children waiting in the paralytic divorce case when no one is even arguing against the relief 
Respondent seeks in this SAPCR. The SAPCR can and should proceed on the uncontroverted 
facts in Respondent’s filings.

6. Every day that passes with the children separated from their father is a day of
irreparable harm. The undisputed evidence is that the children are suffering due to 
Respondent’s forced absence from the home. In the months since he was excluded, the children’s 
well-being has precipitously declined: they have fallen behind in school, missed critical medical 
and dental appointments, and have been emotionally traumatized by the sudden and prolonged 
separation from their father. No party—not even Petitioner—has asserted that the children would 
be anything but better off if their father could return to care for them. No one has argued against 
Respondent’s return to the home or his involvement in the children’s daily life. It is axiomatic 
that the best interest of the children is the paramount concern in any case affecting the parent-
child relationship. See Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002 (mandating that “[t]he best interest of the 
child shall always be the primary consideration of the court in determining the issues of 
conservatorship and possession of and access to the child”); Lenz v. Lenz, 79 S.W.3d 10, 14 
(Tex. 2002) (emphasizing that courts must place “predominant emphasis” on what best serves the 
children's welfare, particularly focusing on stability, emotional and educational needs, and 
maintaining frequent contact with fit parents). 
7. The Texas Legislature explicitly prioritized children’s best interests in all
conservatorship and possession determinations: “The best interest of the child shall always be 
the primary consideration of the court in determining the issues of conservatorship and 
possession of and access to the child.” Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002. Texas Supreme Court 
jurisprudence confirms and expands upon this legislative directive, instructing courts to consider 
stability, educational continuity, emotional health, and ongoing relationships with fit parents in 
their best-interest analysis. See Lenz, 79 S.W.3d at 14–15 (holding courts must evaluate what

will best serve the child’s overall welfare, ensuring a stable and emotionally supportive 
environment and maintaining meaningful and frequent parental contact). 
8. Here, it is unquestionably in the children's best interests to have their loving father
back in their daily lives without further delay. Texas public policy explicitly states that children 
should have frequent and continuing contact with parents who have demonstrated the ability to 
act in their best interest. See Tex. Fam. Code § 153.001(a) (declaring the public policy of 
Texas to ensure frequent contact and shared duties between parents and children following 
separation); Lenz, 79 S.W.3d at 14–15 (affirming that Texas policy favors maintaining 
frequent and meaningful parental involvement in a child's life). 
9. Respondent has demonstrated throughout these proceedings that he is a caring, fit
parent whose presence provides the children with stability, support for their education and health, 
and emotional security. By contrast, the children’s current situation—living apart from 
Respondent for no substantiated reason—is destabilizing and harmful. Texas courts recognize the 
urgency of child custody matters and have repeatedly underscored that “justice demands a 
speedy resolution of child custody and child support issues.” In re Tex. Dep’t of Fam. & 
Protective Servs., 210 S.W.3d 609, 613 (Tex. 2006) (orig. proceeding) (quoting Proffer v. 
Yates, 734 S.W.2d 673, 674 (Tex. 1987)). Simply put, the children’s needs cannot wait on 
procedural formalities or a dormant divorce case. Their welfare requires this SAPCR to be heard

will best serve the child’s overall welfare, ensuring a stable and emotionally supportive

environment and maintaining meaningful and frequent parental contact).

8. Here, it is unquestionably in the children's best interests to have their loving father
back in their daily lives without further delay. Texas public policy explicitly states that children
should have frequent and continuing contact with parents who have demonstrated the ability to
act in their best interest. See Tex. Fam. Code § 153.001(a) (declaring the public policy of
Texas to ensure frequent contact and shared duties between parents and children following
separation); Lenz, 79 S.W.3d at 14-15 (affirming that Texas policy favors maintaining

frequent and meaningful parental involvement in a child's life).

9. Respondent has demonstrated throughout these proceedings that he is a caring, fit
parent whose presence provides the children with stability, support for their education and health,
and emotional security. By contrast, the children’s current situation—living apart from
Respondent for no substantiated reason—is destabilizing and harmful. Texas courts recognize the
urgency of child custody matters and have repeatedly underscored that “‘justice demands a
speedy resolution of child custody and child support issues.” In re Tex. Dep’t of Fam. &
Protective Servs., 210 S.W.3d 609, 613 (Tex. 2006) (orig. proceeding) (quoting Proffer v.
Yates, 734 S.W.2d 673, 674 (Tex. 1987)). Simply put, the children’s needs cannot wait on
procedural formalities or a dormant divorce case. Their welfare requires this SAPCR to be heard

doing so. Therefore, the Court must accept this SAPCR and schedule an immediate hearing to 
serve the children's best interests without further delay. See Lenz, 79 S.W.3d at 14–15 (holding 
courts must prioritize swift judicial actions in custody matters, protecting the best interests of 
children). 
D. Fraud and Perjury Render the Prior Orders Void
10. The orders entered in the divorce case that currently keep Respondent out of the home
and away from the children were obtained through fraud, misrepresentation, and even 
perjury. Because those orders were procured by wrongful means, they are void ab initio and 
cannot be permitted to stand in the way of this SAPCR. Texas law does not tolerate court orders 
obtained by trickery or false pretenses. Notably, the temporary orders in the divorce (signed 
January 16, 2024 and later on March 14, 2024) were presented to the Court as “agreed” orders, 
yet Respondent never agreed to them and never signed them. In fact, Respondent had 
expressly opposed the relief in those orders. The “agreement” was a fiction created by 
Petitioner’s counsel. The record reflects that Petitioner’s counsel drafted and submitted those 
orders without Respondent’s consent or signature, and which reference a hearing not found on 
the docket. This is a textbook example of a fraud on the court. A judgment or order entered as 
“agreed” when one party actually objected is void. The Texas Supreme Court’s holding in 
Burnaman v. Heaton is directly on point: when a trial court knows a party does not consent to a 
purported agreed judgment, it must refuse to sign it; any judgment rendered under such 
circumstances “is void.” Burnaman v. Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 (Tex. 1951). 
11. Here, the court was misled – it was never disclosed that Respondent vehemently
disagreed. Without such consent the judgment is void. The law will not give effect to a 
“party’s consent” that was never actually given. Moreover, the way those orders were obtained

was rife with material falsehoods. In her filings, Petitioner knowingly made false statements to 
the Court to justify excluding Respondent from the home. For example, in her Application for 
Protective Order and supporting affidavit, Petitioner grossly misrepresented the facts, painting 
Respondent as a danger without evidence. She alleged incidents that never occurred or twisted 
mundane events into false claims of “family violence.” These misrepresentations were later 
exposed, and Petitioner has never attempted to prove them in any evidentiary hearing. 
Petitioner’s intent was plainly to deceive the Court into granting her sole occupancy of the home 
and custody of the children. Indeed, Respondent’s pending Motion to Dismiss details how 
Petitioner “knowingly made and presented fraudulent claims to the Court regarding 
Respondent’s property, with the intent to deprive him of his interest in his home”, and how 
she acted with intent that “these false claims be given the same legal effect as valid court orders, 
misleading the Court and causing Respondent to be wrongfully deprived of his home and 
livelihood.” 
12. These strong findings, which stand uncontroverted, show that the prior orders were
procured by fraud and deception. Under longstanding Texas precedent, any order obtained by 
extrinsic fraud (fraud that effectively prevents a fair presentation of the case) is void and a 
nullity. See King Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman, 118 S.W.3d 742, 751–52 (Tex. 2003) (judgment 
obtained by fraud can be set aside; only extrinsic fraud – such as keeping a party away from 
court or concealing critical facts – justifies relief).  
13. Here, Petitioner’s fraud was extrinsic in that it kept Respondent from participating
fully (the “agreed” order ploy) and kept the Court from learning the true facts. A litigant who 
lies to gain advantage in a court order subverts the process; the resulting order lacks integrity 
and is void.

14. In sum, the prior temporary orders that ousted Respondent were built on a
foundation of fraud. They should carry no weight and pose no obstacle to granting relief in this 
new SAPCR. This Court not only has the authority to declare such orders void, it has a duty to 
do so in order to prevent manifest injusticec. See Burnaman, 240 S.W.2d at 291. By proceeding 
with a fresh SAPCR, the Court can consider the issues regarding the children de novo, on truthful 
evidence, untainted by the false premises of the earlier orders. Equity regards as done that which 
ought to have been done – the Court should restore Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, 
(Petitioner in the new cause) to his rightful place in the home and children’s lives, as if the 
fraudulent orders had never been entered. 
E. Restoring the True Status Quo of the Family
15. Relief in this SAPCR is also warranted to restore the status quo that existed before
Petitioner’s improper actions. The “last actual, peaceable status quo” in this family was 
Respondent living in the home with the children, as a present and active father. That was the 
reality until late 2023, when Petitioner – through unilateral false allegations – removed 
Respondent from the household. Texas law holds that the purpose of temporary orders and 
injunctive relief is to maintain or restore the status quo pending trial. See In re Shifflet, 462 
S.W.3d 528, 537 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2015, orig. proceeding) (courts aim to restore 
the last peaceable status quo pending final trial). 
16. Here, the true status quo ante was the intact family unit with Respondent present.
The situation now – Respondent barred from the home and children – is a drastic deviation from 
that status quo, achieved only by contested court orders that, as shown, lack validity. Every day 
that Respondent is kept out is a day the family’s natural equilibrium is disturbed further.

Texas courts have intervened in analogous situations to return to the rightful status quo. For 
example, when one party’s unilateral conduct disrupts a long-standing living arrangement, courts 
recognize that stability must be restored for the benefit of all, especially the children. See Smith 
v. McDaniel, 842 S.W.2d 7, 12 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1992, no writ) (courts should preserve or
restore the conditions that existed prior to the controversy to protect the children’s routine and 
sense of security). Here, restoring the status quo means allowing Respondent back into his 
home and parenting role immediately. That was the “last peaceable” situation before litigation 
– a state in which the children were thriving. Notably, the findings in the temporary orders
hearing (held without Respondent) even indicate there were no findings of any imminent harm if 
Respondent were present; the exclusion was based solely on Petitioner’s requested relief, not on 
proven misconduct by Respondent.  
17. Thus, there is no safety-based reason to maintain the current deviation from the norm.
By contrast, there are powerful reasons to return to normalcy: the children’s suffering would be 
alleviated, and the family’s balance and stability would be reestablished. 
18. In short, equity demands that we “undo” the improper disruption caused by
Petitioner’s actions. This SAPCR allows the Court to do exactly that – to realign temporary 
orders with reality and justice. In re Shifflet instructs that the last peaceable status quo should 
be restored pending trial. The last peaceable status was Respondent in the home; restoring that 
will harm no one (again, even Petitioner did not claim any abuse or violence requiring exclusion 
– her application acknowledged no recent violence, only vague fears). Maintaining the current
situation, by contrast, gravely harms the children and prejudices Respondent’s relationship with 
them. Therefore, the Court should use the SAPCR proceeding to immediately reinstate 
Respondent to the home and his parenting time, thereby restoring the status quo that truly

this Court can and should correct now. 
F. The Court’s Duty to Act Without Delay for the Children’s Welfare
19. By accepting this SAPCR as a separate case, the Court can fulfill its paramount duty
to protect the children’s welfare without procedural delay. Courts have a sacred obligation 
to put the interests of children above rigid procedural considerations, especially in emergencies. 
The Texas Supreme Court has emphasized that trial courts must act immediately when 
children’s physical or emotional well-being is at stake, even if procedural complexities exist. 
In In re Tex. Department of Family & Protective Services, for example, the Supreme Court 
admonished that delays in custody matters are intolerable, quoting with approval the maxim: 
“Justice demands a speedy resolution of child custody and child support issues.” 210 S.W.3d 
609, 613 (Tex. 2006). The high court in that case (a mandamus proceeding) required prompt 
action despite procedural entanglements, recognizing that a child’s need for a stable, safe 
environment cannot be made to wait on protracted litigation maneuvers. 
20. Similarly, in Elizondo v. Monteleone, an appellate court noted that when a parent
attempted procedural gambits to delay a custody determination, the court system should not 
allow those tactics to trump the child’s immediate needs. Elizondo v. Monteleone, 96 S.W.3d 705, 
708 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2002, no pet.) (courts will not permit jurisdictional technicalities 
to delay emergency relief in a parent-child case). [(If citation is verified)] In that case, one party 
tried to remove the case to federal court and argued that the state court lacked jurisdiction to 
issue temporary orders during the interim. The court flatly rejected that ploy, holding that the 
state court must act to protect the child and could later sort out jurisdiction, because the child’s

welfare was paramount. The lesson is clear: procedural fencing cannot override the need for 
immediate judicial action when children are suffering. 
21. Here, Petitioner’s inaction and the snares of the divorce case have already delayed
relief for far too long. The children have been without their father for several critical months of 
their development. The Court has the power—and indeed the duty—to cut through the 
procedural morass by creating a new SAPCR docket and promptly addressing the merits of 
conservatorship, possession, and access. There is no jurisdictional barrier to doing so: this Court 
has continuing jurisdiction over the children (by virtue of the ongoing divorce) and thus can hear 
a SAPCR involving them. Any concern about duplicitous litigation is mitigated by the fact that 
the divorce case is effectively moribund; furthermore, Respondent will move to consolidate or 
dismiss the divorce once the SAPCR is in place, if appropriate. What cannot be allowed is more 
delay that leaves the children in a fractured situation. Our Courts are courts of equity as well 
as law, especially in family matters. When equity demands immediate intervention, the Court 
should not hesitate. As the Austin Court of Appeals observed, “when the jurisdiction of the court 
has been properly invoked in matters affecting minor children, the court’s primary consideration 
is the best interest of the children, and the court may enter any order deemed necessary to 
protect and conserve the welfare of the child.” Elizondo, 96 S.W.3d at 708 (citing Tex. Fam. 
Code § 105.001 on temporary orders for a child). In other words, once the Court is aware of a 
child in need, it must act, and act swiftly.

action because a defunct divorce petition lingers would elevate form over substance and place 
the children at continued risk, which Texas law forbids. 
23. In sum, this Court is empowered and required to provide a forum for immediate
relief, and the SAPCR is the proper mechanism to do so. The Court should therefore promptly 
docket this SAPCR as a new case and schedule an emergency hearing on temporary orders for 
the children. 
G. Protective-Order Application Confirms Respondent’s Joint Ownership of the Home
24. Even Petitioner’s own filings acknowledge Respondent’s legal right to return to the
residence. In her sworn Application for Protective Order (filed in September 2023), Petitioner 
explicitly affirmed that the marital residence “is jointly owned or leased by the Applicant and 
Respondent.” 
25. This judicial admission is significant. It means that at the time she sought exclusive
use of the home, Petitioner conceded that Respondent is co-owner (or co-leaseholder) of the 
property. There is no dispute, therefore, that Respondent has an equal property interest and 
legal right to occupy the home. Petitioner cannot now contradict her own sworn statement by 
suggesting Respondent has no such right. 
26. Why is this important? Because the prior orders granting Petitioner exclusive
possession of the home (and excluding Respondent) stand in direct conflict with the parties’ 
property rights and the status quo. Those orders were based not on any finding that Respondent 
lacked ownership or rights to the home, but presumably on a temporary need for protection 
(which, as shown, was falsely claimed). With the exposure of Petitioner’s allegations as false, 
there remains no lawful basis to keep Respondent out of a home that he owns jointly. Texas

25. This judicial admission is significant. It means that at the time she sought exclusive
use of the home, Petitioner conceded that Respondent is co-owner (or co-leaseholder) of the
property. There is no dispute, therefore, that Respondent has an equal property interest and
legal right to occupy the home. Petitioner cannot now contradict her own sworn statement by

suggesting Respondent has no such right.

26. Why is this important? Because the prior orders granting Petitioner exclusive
possession of the home (and excluding Respondent) stand in direct conflict with the parties’
property rights and the status quo. Those orders were based not on any finding that Respondent
lacked ownership or rights to the home, but presumably on a temporary need for protection
(which, as shown, was falsely claimed). With the exposure of Petitioner’s allegations as false,

there remains no lawful basis to keep Respondent out of a home that he owns jointly. Texas

Family Code § 153.003 states that the Court cannot condition a parent’s possession of a child on 
the payment of support or other matters unrelated to the child – likewise, the Court should not 
condition Respondent’s access to his home (and thereby to his children) on a procedurally flawed 
prior order, especially when Petitioner herself admits the home is community property. The 
protective order application further underscores that Petitioner’s sole claim to the home was 
through a temporary court order, not any independent right. When the predicate for that 
temporary order (alleged family violence) is unproven and disputed, the underlying property 
rights must prevail. 
27. In equity, where two parties have equal right to possession of a property, one cannot
exclude the other absent a valid court order supported by good cause. Here, absent the now-
questionable temporary orders, Respondent as joint owner would be free to live in his home. The 
Court should thus give weight to Petitioner’s admission of joint ownership and recognize 
Respondent’s unabated property right. This is yet another reason to allow the SAPCR to go 
forward: so that the issue of residency and possession of the home can be revisited in light of the 
true facts and rights of the parties. The protective order was leveraged into a settlement which 
both parties did not agree to (as the record will show, if needed), meaning no long-term 
restrictions were found warranted. What remains is a fit father who co-owns his home seeking to 
return to his necessity to work and provide financially for the children. Petitioner’s own 
pleadings remove any doubt about his entitlement. Accordingly, the Clerk and Court should not 
hesitate to facilitate Respondent’s return via new temporary orders in this SAPCR, as even 
Petitioner’s sworn statements support Respondent’s position.

H. Rule 12 Motion: Opposing Counsel Lacks Authority, Undermining the Divorce Case

=== PAGE 249 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Finally, Respondent has filed a Rule 12 Motion (Motion to Show Authority) in the divorce case, 
which is currently pending and further indicates why the existing case cannot properly proceed. 
In that motion (filed September 20, 2024), Respondent challenged the authority of Petitioner’s 
attorney of record to act on her behalf.  
28. This challenge was not made lightly – it is supported by evidence that Petitioner’s
counsel never filed the pleadings, is not authorized to practice in this matter under her current 
registration, and may not even have a valid engagement with Petitioner. Notably, since that 
motion was filed, Petitioner’s counsel has failed to respond to it or otherwise prove her 
authority. Rule 12 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provides that an attorney challenged by 
such a motion must appear and show authority to act for the client, or else be struck from the 
case. Petitioner’s counsel has not met this burden. Instead, irregularities have abounded: at a 
recent hearing (on Respondent’s motion to recuse), Petitioner’s counsel appeared without 
having answered the Rule 12 motion, and the Court allowed her to argue on a motion she did 
not respond to, but her authority remains in question.. Moreover, it came to light that Petitioner’s 
counsel has been unable to e-file pleadings on her client’s behalf because her electronic filing 
account is in disarray (registered under a former employer’s email at Cantey Hanger yet is 
signing pleadings for Marx, Altman, & Johnson) . In fact, the few documents “filed” in the 
divorce case on Petitioner’s side were filed by Roderick Marx, not by the attorney herself. And 
tellingly, Petitioner’s counsel failed to file the Notice of Remand after the federal court sent the 
case back, leaving the case hanging indefinitely. All of this demonstrates that Petitioner’s counsel 
is effectively not acting with proper authority or competence in the divorce matter. 
29. This is critical because if Petitioner’s attorney lacks authority, then Petitioner is
essentially unrepresented in the divorce. Her pleadings (including the Original Petition for

Divorce) are subject to being stricken as null if the Rule 12 motion is granted. The entire divorce 
proceeding would be a nullity without an authorized petitioner or counsel – which is another 
reason it has stagnated. It would be unjust to make the children wait for months while this issue 
is sorted out. By contrast, in a new SAPCR, Petitioner can secure proper counsel or proceed pro 
se, but the Rule 12 quagmire in the divorce case can be sidestepped for now to get the children 
relief. The pending Rule 12 motion underscores that the divorce case is on unstable footing. It 
is procedurally snarled by questions of representation. On the other hand, Respondent is ready to 
proceed in the SAPCR immediately – he, as the petitioner in the SAPCR, obviously has 
authority to bring it, and he will serve Petitioner directly. If Petitioner’s prior counsel truly has no 
authority, Petitioner will have to either hire new counsel or represent herself in responding to the 
SAPCR, but at least the case will move forward. The Rule 12 fiasco in the divorce should not be 
allowed to delay relief for the children. Equity again favors moving to a forum (the SAPCR)

cloud over Petitioner’s representation. This factor strongly supports accepting the SAPCR as a 
standalone action and granting the requested hearing and relief without delay. 
I. Conclusion
31. For all the foregoing reasons – lack of prosecution in the divorce, Petitioner’s waiver
of opposition, the children’s urgent needs, the void nature of prior orders, the necessity of 
restoring the status quo, and procedural snares in the divorce case – Respondent respectfully 
urges the Clerk to file the enclosed SAPCR as a new cause of action, and requests that the 
Court set an immediate EX-PARTE hearing on temporary orders in this SAPCR to issue 
injunctive relief immediately allowing access back into the residency and children’s lives. 
The Court has abundant legal justification and equitable grounds to do so. Most importantly, the 
children’s welfare compels immediate action, and the Petitioner will not be adversely 
affected by this decision, and has immediate housing options nearby available to her, 
contrary to the undersigned. Every factor discussed above converges on one truth: these 
children need their father back and need a stable, working court order to govern their custody 
and care – and they need it now, not months from now. By allowing this SAPCR to proceed 
separately, the Court will cut the Gordian knot that the divorce case has become and will be able 
to issue orders truly serving the children’s best interests forthwith. 
32. Respondent is prepared to appear for an emergency hearing on any date and time the
Court can accommodate – preferably today. He is also prepared to file any additional supporting 
documents or evidence the Court may require. All necessary filing fees for this SAPCR are being 
paid, and service of process will be promptly effected on the opposing party. We ask only that the 
Clerk accept this filing (rather than reject or re-route it to the old cause) and that the Court 
immediately calendar the case for a hearing at the earliest possible date. If there are any

NO. 233-765358-25 
IN THE 233RD DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THE 233RD DISTRICT COURT: 
COMES NOW, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, Petitioner pro se, and files this Rule 12 
Motion to Show Authority pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12, and respectfully shows 
the Court as follows: 
1. There is a general presumption that an attorney is acting with authority; however, that
presumption is rebuttable. Breceda v. Whi, 187 S.W.3d 148, 152 (Tex. App.--El Paso 2006, no 
pet.). If evidence or circumstances cast doubt on the attorney’s authority, the presumption gives 
way and the attorney must prove actual authority. For example, an attorney who conducted a trial 
is presumed authorized to pursue an appeal, but that presumption can be rebutted with contrary 
evidence. Here, the unusual facts surrounding Ms. Carter’s involvement thoroughly rebut any 
presumption of her authority to represent the Respondent named in this matter, Morgan Michelle 
Myers, as detailed below.

I. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12 – Attorney Must Show Authority
A. Carter’s Lack of Authority Indicia
2. A party in a suit or proceeding pending in a court of this state may, by sworn written
motion stating that he believes the suit or proceeding is being prosecuted or defended without 
authority, cause the attorney to be cited to appear before the court and show his authority to act. 
The notice of the motion shall be served upon the challenged attorney at least ten days before the 
hearing on the motion. At the hearing on the motion, the burden of proof shall be upon the 
challenged attorney to show sufficient authority to prosecute or defend the suit on behalf of the 
other party. Tex. R. Civ. P. 
3. Multiple red flags call into question whether Carter is authorized – or even genuinely
acting – as Ms. Myers’s counsel, justifying relief under Rule 12. Petitioner respectfully requests 
that the court requires RODERICK D. MARX and COOPER L. CARTER to appear and show 
their authority to represent MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS in this matter to clear up the 
ambiguity surrounding their representation. 
B. Pleadings Filed by Proxy
4. Every filing attributed to Carter in this case was filed through another attorney, Roderick
Marx, rather than by Carter herself. Mr. Marx is the founding partner of the MAJ firm Carter 
formerly worked for, and he submitted documents “on her behalf” through the electronic filing 
manager. In effect, Carter has not personally prosecuted or defended anything – someone else is 
handling the filings. This raises serious doubts about whether Carter is acting as counsel or whether 
Mrs. Myers’s case is being carried (or neglected) by others without a clear designation. An attorney 
of record should be the one signing filings or at least directly supervising and endorsing them; if

manager. In effect, Carter has not personally prosecuted or defended anything — someone else is
handling the filings. This raises serious doubts about whether Carter is acting as counsel or whether
Mrs. Myers’s case is being carried (or neglected) by others without a clear designation. An attorney

of record should be the one signing filings or at least directly supervising and endorsing them; if

not, the court and opposing party cannot even be sure the attorney whose name is on the pleadings 
is truly involved. Such proxy filings strongly indicate that Carter may lack authority or engagement 
– if she had authority, one would expect her direct participation. Rule 12 is meant to prevent exactly
this sort of scenario where a suit might be conducted by someone without clear authorization. 
C. Employment/Firm Misrepresentation
5. Carter’s own public statements conflict with the representations made to the court about
her role. While her pleadings continued to identify her as “Cooper Carter, Marx Altman & 
Johnson” (with a MAJ email address), her initial response in the instant case was filed by Roderick 
D Marx, signed by Cooper Carter with the Marx, Altman & Johnson letterhead, and then claimed 
that Cooper L. Carter was retained in her individual capacity. Further: 
i. Carter’s public Facebook profile claims that she is no longer employed with Marx,
Altman, & Johnson. 
ii. Carter’s public LinkedIn profile claims that she is no longer employed with Marx,
Altman, & Johnson, and that she currently is employed at Cantey and Hanger, LLP. 
iii. Carter’s Electronic Filing Manager is registered under ccarter@canteyhangar.com.
This level of ambiguity is unnecessary and could be deliberate. In fact, Texas law requires attorneys 
to keep their State Bar profile updated with current employment information (Tex. Gov’t Code 
§ 81.115), which currently reflects her employment with Marx, Altman & Johnson.  So the
question remains: why would Carter update her Texas State Bar profile to reflect her current 
employer but leave her social media and LinkedIn outdated?

6. Carter’s complete failure to prosecute the divorce case for an extended period also
undercuts any claim of active authority. An attorney who is truly acting with a client’s authorization 
is expected to pursue the client’s interests diligently – e.g. respond to motions, appear at hearings, 
move the case forward. Carter, however, has been conspicuously silent. She has not plead any 
defense for her client, has not participated in any discovery.  
7. Carter’s abrupt appearance in this suit—after months of silence in the divorce case—
mirrors the same confusion and procedural uncertainty that plagued the divorce action. This re-
emergence appears tactical, not substantive, and should not obstruct the SAPCR’s merits-based 
progression. She has not mentioned anything about the children, their status, or how the current 
situation is what’s best for them.  
8. Carter’s only notable action in the last six months related to her client has been to seek
consolidation of the SAPCR with the dormant divorce – essentially tethering the active custody 
matter to a paralyzed divorce case which would further prejudice the children and delay the relief 
sought. 
II. Conflicts of Interest and Duty of Candor
9. Misrepresenting one’s role or affiliation can also create conflicts of interest and
breaches of the duty of candor. If an attorney signs pleadings stating it was “necessary to retain 
their legal services” while filing under a firm’s name, it muddles who was retained – the individual 
lawyer or the firm. This ambiguity can prejudice the client’s interests and the opposing party’s 
understanding of the representation. 
10. For example, in the case at hand the answer explicitly stated, “It was necessary for
Morgan [Michelle] Myers to secure the services of COOPER L. CARTER, a licensed attorney, to

prepare and defend this suit.”.  Yet, the filing was styled as coming from “Marx Altman & 
Johnson” with Carter as the attorney. If Mrs. Carter was operating as a solo practitioner at that 
point, the pleading arguably misled the court about who had been hired. This kind of 
misrepresentation may violate the lawyer’s candor toward the tribunal (e.g. Tex. Disc. R. 3.03 
or its equivalents) since it obscures a material fact – the lawyer’s true status. Courts have held that 
lawyers must not omit facts necessary to keep statements from being misleading. Failing to clarify 
that the attorney is no longer with the named firm, it could be seen as an omission that makes the 
filing as a whole misleading. 
III. Unauthorized Filings and “Ghost” Representation
12. Having documents filed by another attorney who has not formally appeared is another
problematic practice. In proper procedure, every pleading or motion must be signed by an 
attorney of record – i.e. a lawyer who has made an appearance in the case. Texas is clear: “Every 
pleading of a party represented by an attorney shall be signed by at least one attorney of record 
in his individual name.” If Attorney A is counsel of record, it is improper for Attorney B (who 
has not appeared in the case) to file documents on A’s behalf without disclosure or court 
permission.  
13. In the example above, the e-filing system’s certificate shows “Roderick Marx on
behalf of Cooper Carter” as the filer, neither of which have formally appeared. This kind of 
“ghost filing” blurs who is responsible for the document. Courts frown upon undisclosed 
involvement of attorneys because it can circumvent accountability and confuse the record. At 
best, it is an irregular practice; at worst, it could be seen as misrepresentation to the court. Here, 
given the same circumstances exist in the divorce case which has been abandoned, Petitioner 
believes the situation leans more towards misrepresentation.

14. Procedurally, if an attorney who is not counsel of record submits a filing, the court
may treat that filing as nullity or require it to be redone. No appearance means no authority to 
act. From an ethical standpoint, using another lawyer to file pleadings without notice may 
implicate rules against aiding in rule violations. Lawyers are forbidden from assisting or 
inducing others to violate the rules (see Tex. Disc. R. 8.04(a)(1). If Attorney A knows they 
should appear officially but instead has Attorney B file a document to evade a procedural 
requirement, both attorneys tread on thin ice. They could be seen as trying to circumvent the 
rules of the tribunal. At a minimum, this lack of transparency undermines trust. The proper 
course would have been for the second attorney to file a notice of appearance (if joining the case) 
or for the original attorney to personally sign and file the pleading. Having someone “cover” a 
filing without formal acknowledgment is not a recognized practice. In short, any attorney 
involved in a case needs to either be of record or stay behind the scenes entirely. But if an 
attorney actually files or signs on behalf of the attorney of record, that person effectively steps 
into the role of counsel without the court’s knowledge, which is improper. It is better to err on 
the side of disclosure – either by formal association of that attorney or by avoiding involvement 
in filing. 
15. As pointed out, the Petitioner believes that this is occurring because Carter’s EFM
account is setup under her prior employer’s email address. So why not change it to reflect the 
correct address and file your own pleadings? Lastly, these same issues have been present in the 
divorce matter, and although Carter was served with a Rule 12 motion in that case on September 
20, 2024, she has yet to clear up this issue.  
IV. CONCLUSION AND PRAYER

court an EMERGENCY MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER to be
issued immediately and without prior notice to the Respondent, MORGAN MICHELLE
MYERS ("Mother"), for the safety and welfare of their two minor children M.E.M. and
C.R.M., the parties’ biological children. The Respondent has been informed of this

request for a TRO as well as her attorney, COOPER L. CARTER. Petitioner has received

M.2302 M.2302

=== PAGE 279 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
no response from either individual. Swift injunctive relief is needed to safeguard the well-
being of the children – including immediate medical needs, schooling needs, financial 
needs, and emotional needs that the Petitioner has the ability, desire, and duty to satisfy. 
The Respondent has disrupted the stable living environment enjoyed by the 
children up until the Petitioner's unlawful exclusion on March 6, 2024. They have been 
left without a Father for over thirteen months without any legal justification and are now 
being raised by their elderly great-grandparents in place of their Father. 
The forthcoming and undisputed facts uncover the true intent behind the 
Respondent's actions and clearly demonstrate the need for the Petitioner's immediate re-
entry into their lives. 
I. STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION
This Court has jurisdiction, and the authority grants the requested relief because 
no valid existing orders bar such action. The only prior orders affecting the parties were 
issued in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County, but those orders are void and of no 
legal effect. Under Texas Family Code § 201.013(b), an associate judge's order does not 
become final unless and until the referring district court judge signs the order. 
Moreover, the orders claim that all parties agree to the terms of the order despite 
the Petitioner's signature being absent. In the prior proceedings (Cause Nos. 322-744263-
23 in the 322nd District Court), an associate judge signed a "temporary" order on March 
14, 2024 that purported to be an agreement between the parties. Critically, no district 
judge of the 322nd District Court ever signed or adopted that order, as required by law. 
TEX. FAM. CODE Sec. 201.013. Given this fact, the orders have no legal effect and

should be declared void by this court, or in the alternative, voidable, and vacated without 
delay. There is effectively no valid court order currently governing the parties' residence 
or conservatorship rights. This Court may therefore proceed to protect the children's 
welfare and the parties' rights as justice requires, unimpeded by the defective 322nd 
District Court order. 
Furthermore, this court has jurisdiction because the Respondent cannot argue that 
the related cause number retains dominated jurisdiction. Texas law does allow a court to 
lose dominant jurisdiction if the party with the first suit proceeded in bad faith or the suit 
is not actively pursued. Both apply here, as demonstrated below. The first suit was 
unquestionably brought in bad faith, and the case hasn't been actively pursued for over 
six months by the opposition, leaving the children in procedural limbo and their needs 
unaddressed. 
II. STATEMENT OF FACTS
1. On December 12, 2023, Petitioner discovered over 6,500 text messages
exchanged between the Respondent and an individual named DAMEN GAULT 
KAZLAUSKAS by checking the usage history on the joint AT&T account owned by the 
Respondent's grandmother and paid for by the Petitioner, who had access to the account. 
(these records are voluminous and will be provided at hearing) 
2. On December 14, 2023, in response to this discovery, the Respondent made
plans to visit the residence of an individual named DANIEL KENNETH 
BRANTHOOVER, her stepfather.

October 18, 2024.

52. On November 1, 2024, Justice E. Lee Gabriel was assigned to hear the recusal

motion.

53. On November 4, 2024, Petitioner filed a PRE-TRIAL MOTION IN LIMINE.

57. On December 12, 2024, the Petitioner filed a NOTICE OF REMOVAL with
the 322nd District Court, and removed the case to the Northern District of Texas. 
58. On December 14, 2024, the case was REMANDED by the Northern District
of Texas for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

irreparable injury on both Petitioner and the children. Irreparable harm means an injury 
that cannot be adequately compensated for money damages or corrected later. That is 
exactly the case here.

65. Petitioner is being deprived of the irreplaceable experience of parenting his
children during their formative years. No amount of monetary compensation or later 
visitation can make up for the lost time, missed milestones, and emotional bonding that 
has been denied for over a year. Courts have recognized that interference with custodial 
or visitation rights constitutes irreparable harm, as time lost with one's child is gone 
forever. The children are likewise losing the benefit of a father's love, guidance, and daily 
care – a harm that is unquestionably irreparable. If this wrongful separation continues, the 
risk increases that the parent-child bond could be permanently damaged. Reunification 
becomes harder as more time passes; thus the urgency is extreme. 
66. The children have been suffering confusion, instability, and emotional distress
due to the sudden absence of Petitioner and the drastic changes imposed by Respondent. 
They went from having both parents in their daily life to seeing only one parent, with no 
satisfactory explanation. Respondents' insertion of a new father-figure (Mr. Kazlauskas) 
has exacerbated their confusion and anxiety. This kind of emotional turmoil in young 
children can lead to long-term psychological issues – a classic irreparable injury, as the 
court cannot later repair the trauma inflicted on a child's sense of security. Restoring 
Petitioner's presence is needed now to begin healing the damage and to reassure the 
children that their father has not abandoned them. The more time that passes, the deeper 
the potential harm to the children's mental health. 
67. Petitioner's fundamental right to maintain his familial relationship with his
children (protected by the U.S. and Texas Constitutions) is being violated. Such a 
violation is inherently irreparable. Deprivation of one's home – being ousted without 
cause – is also a profound personal harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law.

Petitioner has effectively been made a stranger to his own family and property based on 
false pretenses. If the Court does not act, the Petitioner will continue to suffer intangible 
harms such as loss of income, anguish, and the erosion of his role as a father, none of 
which can be quantified or compensated later. 
IV. THE RESPONDENT'S MISCONDUCT
Perjury and Aggravated Perjury (Tex. Penal Code §§ 37.02–.03) 
68. Texas law makes it a crime to make false statements under oath. Perjury
occurs when a person, with intent to deceive, makes a false statement under oath in a 
proceeding where an oath is required. 
69. If the false statement is made in connection with an "official proceeding" and
is material, it becomes Aggravated Perjury, a third-degree felony. In civil cases, 
knowingly submitting false affidavits or testimony can also constitute perjury and be 
treated as a fraud upon the court. Courts have recognized that false sworn statements in 
family law matters are serious misconduct, undermining the judicial process and 
potentially warranting sanctions or even criminal referral (e.g., Skepnek v. Mynatt, 8 
S.W.3d 377, 381 (Tex. App. – El Paso 1999) (attorney sanctioned $30,000 for filing false 
affidavit). 
70. Here, Respondent swore to multiple false statements under oath, meeting all
elements of perjury and aggravated perjury. For example:

71. On December 18, 2023, Respondent filed a sworn "Affidavit of Inability to
Pay" court costs, claiming she had only $20 in her bank account. This statement was 
knowingly false. Just two days prior, Respondent had transferred $1,576.00 in marital 
funds to herself, as confirmed by text messages with her relative (Dan Branthoover) on 
December 16. She then appeared in court swearing she was penniless and could not 
afford the $400 filing fee. In that same affidavit, Respondent also lied that she alone paid 
certain expenses (two car loans and $800 rent plus utilities), when in fact Petitioner had 
been paying those bills; he continued to pay for the vehicles Respondent claimed to 
finance on her own. Bank statements and financial records will clearly establish this fact 
on the merits. Respondent's counsel has never refuted these facts. Thus, Respondent 
made multiple false statements under oath, meeting Penal Code § 37.02. Because these 
affidavits were filed in court proceedings and were material to the case (securing a fee 
waiver and influencing the court's actions), they also qualify as aggravated perjury under 
§ 37.03. Each false statement was material to issues before the court (Respondent's
financial status and credibility), satisfying the materiality requirement. 
False Statements in Protective Order Filings 
72. Respondent submitted false sworn statements in her applications for
protective orders. Texas Family Code § 82.009 requires that an application for a 
temporary ex parte protective order "contain a detailed description of the facts" of alleged 
family violence and be sworn as true by the applicant. Respondent sought an ex parte 
protective order on or about Dec. 14, 2023, claiming abuse, yet on Dec. 22, 2023, she 
was photographed laughing and playing with the children alongside Petitioner – conduct 
wholly inconsistent with someone in fear of imminent harm. In fact, that same day, she

had applied for a second protective order against the Petitioner with similar allegations. 
No credible evidence of family violence was ever presented in thirteen months of 
litigation but has been used as a barrier from accessing the home where the Petitioner is 
needed. 
73. The contextual evidence of falsity (her normal familial behavior with
Petitioner the same day she sought Protection) defeated her sworn claims of "fear" or 
violence and display that they were indeed fabricated. At the very least, her contradictory 
sworn assertions – e.g. claiming on Dec. 18 to have an "active" protective order based on 
family violence (to justify a divorce waiver) when in truth none existed – demonstrate a 
reckless disregard for the truth under oath. 
74. These false protective order filings were not isolated incidents but part of a
calculated strategy to remove Petitioner from the family home and children's lives. The 
timing of these filings—immediately after the discovery of Respondent's extramarital 
relationship with Mr. Kazlauskas—reveals their true purpose: not to protect against 
genuine violence, but to preemptively silence Petitioner and prevent him from exposing 
Respondent's infidelity and financial misconduct. By falsely claiming fear while 
simultaneously engaging in normal family activities with Petitioner, Respondent 
demonstrated the fabricated nature of her allegations. 
75. The pattern of deception is unmistakable: Respondent drained the family bank
account on December 15-16, filed false indigency claims on December 18, falsely 
claimed an existing protective order in her divorce petition that same day, then filed yet 
another protective order application on December 22—all while continuing to interact

premeditated plan to use the legal system as a weapon against Petitioner rather than as the 
shield of protection it was designed to be. 
Controlling Law 
76. False testimony or affidavits in a civil proceeding can warrant severe
consequences. While the proper remedy for "intrinsic" fraud (false statements on issues 
litigated at trial) is often a new trial or sanctions rather than voiding a judgment, courts do 
not hesitate to act on clear perjury. Texas courts have inherent authority to address fraud 
on the court, and criminal prosecution for aggravated perjury is a possibility for egregious 
lies under oath. Indeed, aggravated perjury in court proceedings is a felony punishable by 
2–10 years' imprisonment (Tex. Penal Code § 37.03(b)). 
77. That is precisely what has occurred in this case, and Respondent should face
some consequences for her actions, but Petitioner believes that prolonged incarceration 
would not be in the best interests of his children, but that some form of legal repercussion 
is necessary to deter similar behavior in the future. She has made no effort to defend 
these claims, no effort to prosecute her case, and the Petitioner prays that this court 
realize the severity of this situation on those effected most: the children. 
V. BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILDREN

79. Here, this statutory mandate was grossly violated by the Respondent and her
purported counsel, who have suddenly become active in the litigation here despite 
remaining silent for over eight months in the parallel case destined for dismissal. 
80. Indeed, the instant case reveals a Mother with an agenda to erase the parent
the children relied on the most from their lives despite a valid legal reason, and has 
disregarded their livelihood in the process. 
81. Respondent's conduct constitutes a blatant violation of the "best interest"
standard mandated by Texas Family Code §§ 153.001 and 153.002. Texas law declares it 
the public policy of this state to assure that children have frequent and continuing contact 
with parents who act in the child's best interest, to provide a safe and stable environment 
for the child, and to encourage both parents to share in raising the child. Moreover, the 
best interest of the child must always be the court's primary consideration in matters of 
conservatorship and access. Respondent has flagrantly defied these principles by 
prioritizing her extramarital relationship with Mr. Damen Kazlauskas over the emotional, 
psychological, and familial stability of her own children. 
Orchestrated Campaign of Deception at the Family's Expense 
82. The evidence reveals a disturbing pattern: Respondent orchestrated a
comprehensive campaign of deception that sacrificed her children's emotional well-being 
and family stability to pursue her extramarital relationship. This was not a series of 
isolated incidents but a calculated strategy that unfolded in precise sequence:

84. Second, upon discovery of this relationship, she immediately sought
assistance from Mr. Branthoover to draft legal documents; 
85. Third, she drained the family's financial resources ($1,576) that were intended
for the children's Christmas gifts; 
86. Fourth, she filed false protective order applications and a fraudulent indigency

damage in Respondent's effort to reconstruct her life with Mr. Kazlauskas, who she now

while she was still actively living with Petitioner and the children.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
wreaks emotional havoc on the children. They are left in a state of confusion—believing 
their family has been permanently fractured when in fact the legal marriage remains 
intact. By intentionally misrepresenting such a fundamental truth, Respondent has shown 
a willingness to confuse and emotionally harm her children to justify her own choices, in 
direct contravention of her duty to prioritize the children's emotional well-being. 
Prioritizing an Extramarital Relationship Over Family 
91. Compounding the harm, Respondent is openly celebrating a relationship with
Mr. Kazlauskas – a man with whom she entered an extramarital relationship while still 
married to Petitioner. She has flaunted this relationship and positioned Mr. Kazlauskas as 
a replacement father figure to the children, celebrating milestones with him that should be 
reserved for family. In doing so, Respondent elevates her personal relationship over her 
children's need for stability and continuity with their real father. This behavior sends the 
children a disturbing message: that their father's role in their lives is interchangeable or 
unimportant. Such a message is detrimental to the children's best interests, as it 
undermines their sense of security, identity, and trust in their family structure and the 
close relationship that they have shared with their father throughout their lives. 
Active Alienation and Erasure of the Father 
92. Respondent has gone to alarming lengths to minimize and erase Petitioner's
presence in the children's lives. She has introduced Mr. Kazlauskas to the children as if 
he were a new parent, while simultaneously telling the children that Petitioner (their 
father) is no longer in their lives. This calculated act of alienation strikes at the very heart

wreaks emotional havoc on the children. They are left in a state of confusion—believing
their family has been permanently fractured when in fact the legal marriage remains

intact. By intentionally misrepresenting such a fundamental truth, Respondent has shown
a willingness to confuse and emotionally harm her children to justify her own choices, in

direct contravention of her duty to prioritize the children's emotional well-being.

Prioritizing an Extramarital Relationship Over Family

91. Compounding the harm, Respondent is openly celebrating a relationship with
Mr. Kazlauskas — a man with whom she entered an extramarital relationship while still
married to Petitioner. She has flaunted this relationship and positioned Mr. Kazlauskas as
a replacement father figure to the children, celebrating milestones with him that should be
reserved for family. In doing so, Respondent elevates her personal relationship over her
children's need for stability and continuity with their real father. This behavior sends the
children a disturbing message: that their father's role in their lives is interchangeable or
unimportant. Such a message is detrimental to the children's best interests, as it
undermines their sense of security, identity, and trust in their family structure and the

close relationship that they have shared with their father throughout their lives.

92. Respondent has gone to alarming lengths to minimize and erase Petitioner's

of Texas public policy, which seeks to ensure children maintain frequent and continuing 
contact with both parents. 
93. Instead of fostering the father–child relationship, Respondent has deliberately
attempted to sever it. The children are being taught through Respondent's words and 
actions that their father has effectively disappeared and been substituted by a stranger, 
causing profound emotional damage and confusing the children about who their father is. 
This behavior is not only cruel; it is directly contrary to the children's best interests and 
Texas's clear directives that children benefit from the love and involvement of both 
parents. 
93. The children's current living situation—being raised primarily by elderly
great-grandparents rather than their capable and willing father—further demonstrates 
how Respondent's personal agenda has superseded the children's needs. Rather than 
allowing Petitioner to fulfill his parental role and provide daily care and support to the 
children, Respondent has relegated this responsibility to extended family members, 
depriving the children of their father's presence, guidance, and care during crucial 
developmental years. 
94. Respondent's systematic use of false protective orders, perjured testimony,
and procedural manipulation has created a legal fiction that has kept Petitioner from his 
children for over thirteen months. This separation was not based on any legitimate safety 
concern or the children's best interests, but solely on Respondent's desire to reconstruct 
her family unit with Mr. Kazlauskas at the center—effectively erasing Petitioner from the 
children's lives to accommodate her new relationship.

95. The harm to the children from this prolonged, unjustified separation from their
father cannot be overstated. Research consistently shows that children benefit from the 
active involvement of both parents, and that unnecessary disruption of the parent-child 
bond can cause lasting psychological damage. By prioritizing her personal relationship 
over her children's need for both parents, Respondent has demonstrated a fundamental 
misalignment with the "best interest" standard that Texas law demands be the "primary 
consideration" in all matters affecting children. 
96. Despite the Respondent’s egregious actions, the Petitioner wishes her no ill
will as she is the mother of his Children and only seeks an amicable path forward that 
suits their best interests. As of now, the Children need their father, and this situation 
engineered by the Respondent shows that her fitness as a parent has been called into 
question, and her priorities are not in the correct place. Petitioner vows his return to the 
family home will only bring much needed stability to his children and will be in their best 
interests for their day-to-day livelihood.

MR 7.27
The children are suffering daily from their father being prevented
access to the marital home. The Respondent has prevented access
since March 6, 2024, knowing the Petitioner's need for the residence to work.
This has left the children without the care of either parent for the majority
of the time, and are being told that the divorce has been finalized
and that their father is a bad person.
Prior to the Respondent's removal, the Children were cared for both emotionally and financially by the Petitioner. The Respondent
knowingly and willingly sabotaged this relationship to further her own agenda with a separate relationship.
The emotional well-being and stability of the children have been destroyed, and their stable life has been dismantled
by the Respondent in bad faith. There exists no legal basis for the current situation to persist,
and the children are already showing signs of distress, emotional trauma, and are beginning to struggle academically.
The children need the Petitioner's stable, nurturing care during this difficult time, and they will soon lose all access to their Father who will be homless given the circumstances.
The Petitioner has been fighting for over a year to get back into his residence to no avail. The Respondent has refused to participate, and 
continues to prioritize her new relationship over the children. Notice would only spark more deceptive legal actions from the Respondent to try and subvert justice.

possession of:  
 The Petitioner 
 The following person:  _________________________________________________ 
(See Texas Family Code 105.001(c)(1-2))
 Respondent is excluded from possession of or access to the child(ren) until notice can be 
served and a hearing can be held.
 Respondent’s possession of or access to the child(ren) is limited as follows until notice 
can be served and a hearing can be held: 
  Respondent is excluded from unsupervised possession of the child(ren). 
Possession of the child(ren) shall be supervised by:  
 Any person approved in writing by Petitioner 
 A person approved by the Court: ___________________________________ 
 Respondent is excluded from overnight visits with the child(ren). Any day visits shall 
begin no earlier than ___________ a.m. and shall end no later than ____________ p.m. 
 Respondent may not allow the child(ren) to have any contact with the following 
person(s): 
______________________________________________________________________ 
 Respondent may not engage in the following acts during any periods of possession 
or access: 
______________________________________________________________________ 
______________________________________________________________________ 
______________________________________________________________________ 
3. This restraining order is effective immediately and will continue in full force and effect until it
expires by its terms within a time period determined by the Court (not to exceed 14 days),
unless within that time frame the order is extended for good cause shown, or unless the
Respondent consents that it may be extended for a longer period. See Texas Rule of Civil Procedure
680. 
This restraining order expires on the following date: _______________________________. 
THE VIOLATION OF A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER IS PUNISHABLE BY 
CONTEMPT AND THE ORDER IS SUBJECT TO AND ENFORCEABLE UNDER CHAPTER 
157 OF THE TEXAS FAMILY CODE. See Texas Family Code 105.001(f).   
Petitioner will be able to surprise the children by picking them up from school, and they will finally be reuinted with their father, 
something that they anticipate and desperately need. The Respondent has shown no ability to act in the children's best interests.

Notice of Temporary EX-Parte TRO

To: Cooper Carter <coopercarter@majadmin.com>
Ms. Carter,
Pursuant to Tarrant County Local Rule 3.30(c)  , this letter provides notice that I intend to present an Emergency Ex
Parte Application for Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) seeking immediate relief in the interest of my children’s well-
being and to prevent irreparable harm to my property, family relationships, and ability to earn a living.
The TRO will NOT request exclusive temporary use of the marital residence but that if your client has issue, she has
alternative housing and has used possession of the residence to damage my livelihood and restrict my parenting time.
The application will include verified evidence supporting the necessity of immediate relief, including:
Verified communications acknowledging my need for the home to work
Records of financial losses from displacement (Airbnb receipts, business losses, etc.)
Evidence of your client disposing of or concealing my personal property
Proof that the children have been left unsupervised overnight by your client on multiple occasions.
Documentation from the school showing excessive absences and academic concerns regarding Mara.
Text evidence between myself and the multiple AIRBNB hosts showcasing the difficulty faced in setting up
operations outside of the reliable setup of the house.
Photographs and texts contradicting claims made in previous pleadings
Dental neglect of my youngest daughter (photos of untreated cavities)
Financial documents showing I paid all vehicle and rent obligations, contrary to your client’s claims
Text messages between myself and the grandparents of your client showing we can be amicable during this
situation and put the children first.
Photo evidence showing the only way I have to communicate with my daughters is via an online game, ROBLOX,
due to your client preventing communications.
My criminal record showing that I have never been convicted of a violent crime.
The current temporary orders which are facially void and can be collaterally attacked in any court at any time.
Again, there is absolutely zero reason to have me barred from the residence and strip the children of their parents. It
contradicts the lodestone of the Family Code which is in the best interests of the children. 
This is the more logical solution. If we pursued this route in the beginning, we'd already be divorced and the children's
financial stability wouldn't have been sacrificed. There is no risk of danger. There is no risk of harm to the children. There
is only the possibility of recovery. That is in their best interests.
There is no legal reason your client has to want me out of the house other than just that. She cannot unilaterally decide
that I agree to everything and then do as she pleases with my personal belongings and neglect the children in multiple
areas.
Your argument that I agreed to the orders in place falls flat on its face for many reasons which will not be repeated here.
I am providing this notice strictly to comply with Local Rule 11(e). I will proceed to present the application to the Court
without further delay due to the nature of the harm and urgency involved.
If you wish to discuss these matters, I'm happy to do so - otherwise I will inform the court that you do not agree to the
orders upon submission.
This situation cannot continue, and the alternatives that are available must be pursued to uphold the best interests of the
children before any further damage to their well-being is sustained.
Respectfully,
Charles Dustin Myers

Cooper,
Petitioner (your client) filed the original divorce petition in December 2023 in the 322nd District Court (Cause No. 322-
744263-23). In that petition, she alleged false claims of family violence and sought a waiver of the 60-day waiting
period for divorce, ostensibly to expedite temporary relief by labeling me as an abuser and claiming she had an active
order of protection against me at the time of filing. 
On February 1, 2024, a temporary orders hearing was held before an Associate Judge. The parties (through counsel)
announced an apparent agreement on temporary custody and other matters. The associate judge signed an “Associate
Judge’s Report for Temporary Orders”, titled as “Agreed Temporary Orders.” Importantly, this report did not itself
constitute a signed court order; instead, it outlined the agreed terms and directed further action before any order would
be final. Specifically, the report stated that Respondent's attorney (Dan Bacalis) would prepare a formal temporary
orders document, which would be prepared from 20 days from the date of signing, which would have been February
22nd, 2024. It also required that both attorneys were to approve it to form within 5 days (have 5 days to approve
the order), and that if no agreement on form was reached, a motion to sign would need to be filed within 30 days.
The report noted that the parties’ personal approval was not required for entry of the order, implying the attorneys’ sign-off
or a court motion would suffice. No district judge signed an order at that time – the associate judge’s report was
essentially a recommendation to be formalized in a written order.  
Immediately after the Feb 1 hearing, Respondent lost confidence in his attorney’s actions and fired his attorney.
Believing that the “agreement” did not reflect the child’s best interests or was entered under false pretenses (due to
Petitioner’s unfounded allegations), Respondent promptly withdrew his consent to the announced terms. On February
5, 2024, before any temporary order was signed by the court, Respondent (now pro se) filed an Emergency Motion to
Reconsider and Vacate Temporary Orders. This motion put the court on notice that Respondent no longer consented to
the supposed agreed terms and that he objected to any temporary order being entered as announced.  
Despite this, the reconsideration was denied and no findings were ever entered. In fact, the order explicitly ordered
Respondent to sign the orders to which he did not agree in violation of his own directives.
Texas law is clear that an associate judge’s report or proposed order is not a final, enforceable court order
unless and until it is adopted and signed by the referring court. Under the Family Code, an associate judge may
conduct hearings and recommend orders, but those recommendations remain subject to approval by the district court
judge. Section 201.011 of the Texas Family Code provides that an associate judge’s report “may contain the associate
judge’s findings, conclusions, or recommendations and may be in the form of a proposed order”. In other words, the
associate judge’s report (even if titled “Temporary Orders”) is essentially a draft or advisory decision; it does not itself
carry the force of a court order until the proper procedures are completed.  
Family Code § 201.013 unambiguously outlines how and when an associate judge’s proposal becomes an order of the
court. If a party timely requests a de novo hearing by the referring judge, the associate judge’s proposed order may be
enforced in the interim (except for certain matters) pending that hearing. However, if no timely request for a de novo
hearing is filed, the statute states that “the proposed order or judgment of the associate judge becomes the
order or judgment of the referring court only on the referring court’s signing the proposed order or judgment.”
Thus, absent a de novo appeal, an associate judge’s recommendation must be signed by the district judge to have any
legal effect. Until the judge signs it, it is merely a proposed order, not an actual court order.  
Because the February 1, 2024 temporary orders were never signed or adopted by the court, Respondent was (and is)
under no legal obligation to follow them, and neither party could properly enforce those terms through contempt or other
remedies. A party cannot be held in contempt for violating a non-existent court order. Here, the “Agreed Temporary
Orders” are, at most, an agreement between the parties that was not entered as a judgment. When Respondent withdrew
his agreement (as discussed below), even that contractual underpinning fell apart.  The Family Code’s requirements were
not met, and thus the purported temporary orders are void ab initio due to lack of rendition or entry by the referring
court.  
The stage is thus set for this Court to intervene, because as of now, there is no operative temporary order governing
the child’s conservatorship or possession.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Because the February 1, 2024 temporary orders were never properly entered as a court order (and would have been
invalid if entered without consent - which is clearly the case here), they are void and can be attacked in this proceeding.
Generally, once a court renders a final judgment, parties are constrained to challenge that judgment on direct appeal or in
the original case; collateral attacks on final judgments are disfavored. However, only a void judgment is subject to
collateral attack in a separate proceeding. Browning v. Prostok, 165 S.W.3d 336, 346 (Tex. 2005) (“Browning v.
Placke, 698 S.W.2d 362, 363 (Tex. 1985)”)
In this SAPCR, Respondent is effectively collaterally attacking the temporary orders from the divorce case by asserting
their invalidity. Such a collateral challenge is permissible here because those orders are void. As the Texas Supreme
Court has explained, “Only a void judgment may be collaterally attacked.” Id.
Accordingly, Respondent asks this Court to formally declare that the March 26, 2024 “Agreed Temporary Orders” (and
any interlocutory rulings associated with them) in Cause No. 322-744263-23 are void, of no effect, and not binding on
the parties. This declaration will remove any doubt or argument by Petitioner that those terms still govern the parties’
rights. It will also foreclose any attempt to enforce or rely on those non-orders (for example, in claims of violation or in
arguing res judicata). The Court has the authority in equity and under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (Tex. Civ.
Prac. & Rem. Code chapter 37) to declare the rights and status of the parties vis-à-vis that prior proceeding – particularly
given that the SAPCR directly concerns the child who was also at issue in the divorce temporary orders. Granting such
relief is appropriate to prevent confusion and multiplicative litigation. Once the prior “orders” are declared void, this Court
can proceed to issue fresh temporary orders for the child without any conflict or cloud from the divorce case.  
In sum, the prior temporary orders are a legal nullity and this Court should treat them as such. The Court’s order declaring
them void will simply recognize the reality that, due to the procedural faults and lack of consent, those orders never had
legal existence. This clarification is critical to move forward in protecting the child’s welfare, as discussed next.  
Immediate Emergency Relief Is Necessary to Protect the Child’s Best Interest 
Every day that passes without a valid temporary order is a day of potential harm or uncertainty for the child. The
current situation – a divorce case stuck in limbo with no operative orders, and parents in dispute – is untenable for a
child’s well-being. The child has effectively been living under an informal or contested arrangement since February 2024.
Petitioner has acted as though she has primary custody under the (void) temporary orders, while Respondent has been
sidelined and denied the normal possession or decision-making that a proper order (or a true agreement) would have
provided him. This dynamic, fueled by Petitioner’s unproven allegations of family violence, has caused significant stress
and instability for the child. Respondent fears that Petitioner is leveraging the appearance of an order to restrict his
contact with the child and to make unilateral decisions that are not in the child’s best interest. Meanwhile, the divorce
proceeding has not moved forward to a final resolution – over 12 months have elapsed since the March hearing, with no
trial setting in sight. This stalemate directly affects the child: there is no clear court-sanctioned framework for
conservatorship, visitation, or support, and your client has only introduced chaos into their lives.
This Court, now handling the SAPCR, has both the authority and the duty to step in and provide stability. Under Tex. Fam.
Code § 105.001, “the court may make a temporary order, including the modification of a prior temporary order, for
the safety and welfare of the child,” including orders for temporary conservatorship and possession.
The Family Code specifically empowers courts to act expeditiously to protect a child: if there is immediate danger to the
child’s physical or emotional health, the court can even issue temporary orders without notice (such as a temporary
restraining order) to address the emergency. Here, Respondent asserts that the child’s emotional welfare is indeed in
jeopardy. The lack of a valid order has enabled Petitioner to marginalize Respondent’s role in the child’s life, purportedly
under the guise of the void temporary orders. Petitioner’s false accusations of violence – never tested or proven in court –
have created a pretext for her to limit Respondent’s access. Consequently, the child is being unjustly deprived of time and
a relationship with Respondent, who has been a loving father with no history of abuse. This scenario is precisely what
emergency temporary orders are designed to prevent. The Court should not allow a procedural quagmire to result in a
child effectively losing a parent or receiving inferior care.  
Most importantly, the “best interest of the child” is the paramount consideration in any conservatorship or
possession decision. See 153.002 TEX. FAM. CODE.
All Texas courts must ensure that their orders first and foremost serve the child’s best interest. By that standard,
continuing under the shadow of void orders and parental discord is plainly not in this child’s best interest. Instead, the
child’s best interest calls for fresh, valid temporary orders that set forth clear, fair, and safe arrangements for custody and
visitation while the parents’ disputes are resolved. The Court should craft these orders based on current evidence and the
child’s needs – not based on an outdated and unconsented plan from February. The Family Code’s public policy (Tex.
Fam. Code § 153.001) favors frequent, continuing contact with fit parents and stable environments free of violence or
abuse. Here, Respondent is ready, willing, and able to care for the child and poses no danger, and he simply seeks a
normal custody schedule that allows the child to have both parents in his life. Petitioner’s unsupported claims of family

Because the February 1, 2024 temporary orders were never properly entered as a court order (and would have been
invalid if entered without consent - which is clearly the case here), they are void and can be attacked in this proceeding.
Generally, once a court renders a final judgment, parties are constrained to challenge that judgment on direct appeal or in
the original case; collateral attacks on final judgments are disfavored. However, only a void judgment is subject to
collateral attack in a separate proceeding. Browning v. Prostok, 165 S.W.3d 336, 346 (Tex. 2005) (“Browning v.
Placke, 698 S.W.2d 362, 363 (Tex. 1985)”)

In this SAPCR, Respondent is effectively collaterally attacking the temporary orders from the divorce case by asserting
their invalidity. Such a collateral challenge is permissible here because those orders are void. As the Texas Supreme
Court has explained, “Only a void judgment may be collaterally attacked.” Id.

Accordingly, Respondent asks this Court to formally declare that the March 26, 2024 “Agreed Temporary Orders” (and
any interlocutory rulings associated with them) in Cause No. 322-744263-23 are void, of no effect, and not binding on
the parties. This declaration will remove any doubt or argument by Petitioner that those terms still govern the parties’
rights. It will also foreclose any attempt to enforce or rely on those non-orders (for example, in claims of violation or in
arguing res judicata). The Court has the authority in equity and under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (Tex. Civ.
Prac. & Rem. Code chapter 37) to declare the rights and status of the parties vis-a-vis that prior proceeding — particularly
given that the SAPCR directly concerns the child who was also at issue in the divorce temporary orders. Granting such
relief is appropriate to prevent confusion and multiplicative litigation. Once the prior “orders” are declared void, this Court
can proceed to issue fresh temporary orders for the child without any conflict or cloud from the divorce case.

In sum, the prior temporary orders are a legal nullity and this Court should treat them as such. The Court’s order declaring
them void will simply recognize the reality that, due to the procedural faults and lack of consent, those orders never had
legal existence. This clarification is critical to move forward in protecting the child’s welfare, as discussed next.

violence (made to gain a litigation advantage) should not dictate the child’s reality any longer, especially since those
claims have not been substantiated in any court hearing.  
Why your consolidation motion and response are insufficient, and will fail, or be
met with mandamus if granted (after reconsideration)
 Normally, even without continuing exclusive jurisdiction, a prior pending suit would require the new suit to be consolidated
or abated (as discussed above with § 6.407 and dominant jurisdiction). The mother (divorce petitioner) could argue that
the original court “has jurisdiction” over the children by virtue of the pending divorce, so the SAPCR should not proceed
separately. However, the void nature of the prior temporary orders is a game-changer. If those orders are void, then
the original case has not effectively adjudicated anything regarding the children’s current custody or support. The SAPCR
petitioner can contend that because the prior orders are null, there is no valid existing order or active management of the
children’s case, and the new court is free to act in the children’s best interests. This is the EXACT argument made. In
effect, the argument is that the divorce case’s jurisdiction over the children lapsed into dormancy or “dormant jurisdiction”
due to your failure to prosecute the case.
It’s important to distinguish jurisdiction from orders. The continuing jurisdiction doctrine would typically prevent a
different court from issuing orders if a final order existed or if another court was actively handling the case. But here the
SAPCR is filed in the same county as the divorce. There is no risk of two different counties competing; it’s an internal
issue. The SAPCR effectively asks the court to take up a new cause number and to recognize that the old cause has
stalled and its orders are void.  
EVEN IF the void argument fails, there is another nuance to this area of law. Despite the lack of a final order, the
pending divorce still technically invokes the court’s jurisdiction over the children. Typically, the proper course is to revive or
dismiss the dormant divorce, rather than maintain a wholly separate SAPCR on the side. Texas courts adhere to the
principle that the first suit filed (here, the divorce) should dominate; a later-filed suit concerning the same subject (the
children) can be abated to prevent conflicting rulings. In fact, in In re Shifflet, for example, a party attempted parallel
litigation regarding child custody, and the court emphasized that modifications must be filed in the court with jurisdiction
over the original case
The only exception to the one-court rule is narrow. Texas law does allow a court to lose dominant jurisdiction if the
party with the first suit proceeded in bad faith or the suit is not actively pursued. Both apply here. The first suit was
unquestionably brought in bad faith, as the declaration of an active protective order being in effect against the
Respondent was an intentional fabrication designed to provide your client with an advantage. Despite this, the
Texas legislature should have prevented the first hearing from ever happening, because 6.405b of the Texas Family
Code required your client to present the alleged order to the court BEFORE ANY HEARING. 
CONCLUSION 
Thus, the SAPCR is appropriately before the court, and the only argument you made in your Response fails. The court
denied my attempt to open this separate suit, requiring me to file a 17 page argument as to why the case should be
accepted, and then it was.
So your response effectively mirrors the first denial from the court, which amounts to no response being filed at all.
It is clear you are not representing your client in a manner to uphold the law or the best interests of the children, but to
only appear when needed to obstruct the much needed justice that the children need and deserve.
This is my position.

Ms. Wierzbicki, Mr. Carter,
Thank you for the update. However, I must respectfully object to the assertion that this is a mandatory consolidation.
Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 174(a), consolidation is discretionary and not automatic where doing so would cause
delay, injustice, or prejudice to a party. Additionally, the Texas Supreme Court in Curtis v. Gibbs, 511 S.W.2d 263 (Tex.
1974) expressly carved out exceptions to dominant jurisdiction where:
The original case was filed in bad faith,
The case isn't been prosecuted;
Equity and justice require an independent forum.
All three conditions are present here. The SAPCR was filed in good faith after the 322nd case became procedurally
stalled and legally defective—with no Notice of Remand, no evidentiary rulings on the children, and pending dispositive
motions including unopposed requests for dismissal. 
It would be prejudicial to the children to consolidate a case that had no ability to proceed.
Thank you.
Respectfully,
Charles Dustin Myers
Pro Se Petitioner

Friends on other side,
The Emergency EX-PARTE TRO has been filed and accepted by the court and is awaiting the judge's review. 
If a hearing is required, I will CC Cooper in the email correspondence.
If a hearing is not required, I will serve each of you with a copy of the TRO and proposed order in accordance with the
rules no later than seven days prior to the hearing.
The TRO has the following provisions:
* Respondent is PROHIBITED from preventing Petitioner from entering the matrimonial residence located at 6641
Anne Ct, Watauga, TX 76148.
* Respondent is PROHIBITED from disturbing the peace of the minor children named in this suit.
* Petitioner and Respondent are PROHIBITED from acting without candor towards all members of the household
in the presence of the children.
* Respondent is PROHIBITED from bringing the children in the presence of DAMEN GAULT KAZLAUSKAS.
* Respondent is PROHIBITED from taking the children outside of Tarrant County, Texas.
These provisions, if granted, will be in effect until a full hearing is held no later than 14 days after the order is signed by
the judge.
Once the notice of hearing is served on all parties, I will be filing a motion for pre-trial conference to discuss the Rule 12
motion filed and served last week to ensure those issues are resolved prior to trial. 
At the hearing, the relief I am seeking is to convert the provisions from the TRO into temporary injunctions which will be
the exact same but will ask for them to remain until further order of the court and reset the status quo to March 6, 2024,
which was the last peaceful time enjoyed by all parties prior to the Respondent's unlawful lockout.
If a continuance is needed in order to get your affairs in order for the Rule 12 conference, please reach out as I have no
problem signing an agreed continuance if more time is needed.
I am not seeking sanctions at this time.
If granted, I believe the preceding details suit the best interests of Mara and Caroline, preserves their emotional and
financial well-being, allows myself to repair the substantial damage caused from the prior thirteen months, promotes an
amicable co-parenting relationship, and most importantly upholds Texas Law in ensuring that children have continuous,
frequent access to both parents and that parents are encouraged to work together during and after divorce because
doing so is in their best interests.
I'm not looking to punish, hurt, or ruin anyone. I'm simply looking to do what's best for the kids and start working together
to finish this so we can all move on with our lives.
If you have any suggestions, modifications, or alternative solutions, please feel free to reach out and let me know, or
schedule a time and place to meet in person that best meets your schedule.
Respectfully,

Good Evening,
I have received communication from opposing party who is pro se that he will be walking through an Emergency TRO.
Our office has a hearing scheduled for tomorrow morning in Parker County and is unable to attend. However, I will be
available by cell phone regarding this matter if the Judge would like to speak to me regarding the Emergency TRO.
Please contact our office to patch me in for any calls that Judge would like to have.
Additionally, this case already is pending in the 322nd for a divorce proceeding regarding property and children matters.
We will be consolidating the case and walking it through the 322nd for signature next week.
Thank you,

Court staff,
Ms. Carter’s recent correspondence is improper for several reasons, and appears to be an attempt to delay or interfere
with proceedings in which she has otherwise failed to meaningfully participate in. The following reasons support this
statement:
1. An objection to consolidation is already on file and remains unopposed. It cites controlling Texas precedent. Any
suggestion that consolidation is agreed upon or inevitable is misleading. Instead, she should properly file with the court
why the consolidation is improper or at the very least argue against Petitioner's position.
2. Ms. Carter has not fulfilled her obligation under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 237a to file a Notice of Remand. Until
she does, she is prohibited from proceeding or filing anything in the 322nd District Court as they currently do not have
jurisdiction over this matter until this obligation is fulfilled.
3. Her authority to represent the Respondent remains under challenge pursuant to a Rule 12 motion filed September 20,
2024. No hearing has been held, no written statement of authority has been filed, and no ruling has been made. Until
resolved, Rule 12 bars her from participating in either proceeding.
4. Ms. Carter has not prosecuted the case in the 322nd District Court in over eight months. This inaction has prejudiced
the Petitioner and delayed resolution of urgent matters affecting the children.
5. She has failed to file any objections, responsive pleadings, or legal arguments opposing the relief requested—including
the Emergency TRO now pending.
6. Rather than reaching out to Petitioner to resolve any scheduling conflict, Ms. Carter improperly attempted to influence
the court by email. This violates the spirit of cooperation required by the rules, particularly where her participation is
procedurally barred.
7. Ms. Carter’s conduct appears designed to delay relief and subvert the best interest of the children, despite her failure to
oppose the requested relief in any meaningful way.
8. She has been provided with full notice of the Emergency TRO, the proposed order, supporting exhibits, and the time
and location of presentment. She has no legal basis to subvert Petitioner's due process rights.
In summary, Ms. Carter has not provided anything of substance in either Court, has not prosecuted the case, has not
argued on behalf of her client, or followed proper procedure.
Simply labeling the opposition as pro se and claiming that the consolidation will be filed without disclosing the above facts
is dishonest and should not be permitted as it will only cause further unnecessary delays to the relief being sought without
any substance being provided.
Again, all of these points have been argued in both courts, and it is her duty as counsel to handle these matters in
accordance with Texas Law.
These matters should be handled between the parties - not attempt to influence court staff after hours.
The reason we are here in the first place is due to the above unanswered facts. Ms. Carter has had ample time to file an
objection, response, or counter argument, but has chosen not to do so.
It would've been far more appropriate for Ms. Carter to have reached out to me directly to discuss scheduling conflicts.
Prior to the latest email, there was no indication Ms. Carter intended to participate at all despite being provided with all
relevant materials.

Good morning,
Mr. Myers appeared before me to schedule the hearing for the TRO; my apologies I did not realize this was that
same case.  We can go ahead and set the TRO with us, but most likely the case will be transferred prior to the
hearing date and the case needs to be transferred prior to that date.
Mr. Myers will be emailing with dates available for the hearing.

same case. We can go ahead and set the TRO with us, but most likely the case will be transferred prior to the
hearing date and the case needs to be transferred prior to that date.

Mr. Myers will be emailing with dates available for the hearing.

Thank you,

Cooper,
I've already objected.
You have no legal authority to do so until you address my objection filed and served to you.
Furthermore, you have not sent the Notice required by rule 237a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and have not
shown you authority to represent the Petitioner in this matter.
Finally, you claimed to have been retained in your individual capacity yet are claiming Marx Altman and Johnson is filing
pleadings on your behalf, and Roderick D. Marx is not a party in this suit nor has he made a formal appearance.
You're well aware of these obligations, and any order resulting from this motion will be challenged via the proper legal
proceedings.
You cannot continue to disregard the rules of procedure, fail to respond to motions or evidence served to you, and
continue to expect favors from the bench in leu of you performing your duties as a licensed attorneys.
You are put on notice that if any such motion is presented to the court in the face of the above facts or the unanswered
objection already served to you, I will move for your disqualification immediately and will provide the Texas OAG with your
information and detailed misconduct as well as the State Bar of Texas.
Further, you have not provided or served a copy of the proposed order which you intend to present, which is required.
This conversation will be filed and made apart of the official court record. 
Respectfully submitted,
Charles Myers

This Motion to Consolidate the above lawsuits is brought by MORGAN MYERS, who

These lawsuits involve common questions of law or of fact as the parties have a
current divorce case pending in the 322nd Judicial District Court, Cause No. 322-744263-23.
2.
It would serve the convenience of the Court, litigants, and counsel and would

MORGAN MYERS prays that the Court grant the Motion to Consolidate and consolidate 
these lawsuits under the older and lower cause number.

MORGAN MYERS prays that the Court grant the Motion to Consolidate and consolidate
these lawsuits under the older and lower cause number.

Respectfully submitted,

Cooper,
I've already objected.
You have no legal authority to do so until you address my objection filed and served to you.

Furthermore, you have not sent the Notice required by rule 237a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and have not
shown you authority to represent the Petitioner in this matter.

Finally, you claimed to have been retained in your individual capacity yet are claiming Marx Altman and Johnson is filing

pleadings on your behalf, and Roderick D. Marx is not a party in this suit nor has he made a formal appearance.

You're well aware of these obligations, and any order resulting from this motion will be challenged via the proper legal
proceedings.

You cannot continue to disregard the rules of procedure, fail to respond to motions or evidence served to you, and
continue to expect favors from the bench in leu of you performing your duties as a licensed attorneys.

You are put on notice that if any such motion is presented to the court in the face of the above facts or the unanswered
objection already served to you, | will move for your disqualification immediately and will provide the Texas OAG with your
information and detailed misconduct as well as the State Bar of Texas.

Further, you have not provided or served a copy of the proposed order which you intend to present, which is required.
This conversation will be filed and made apart of the official court record.

Respectfully submitted,

Charles Myers

NO. 233-765358-25 
IN THE 233RD DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT: 
I. INTRODUCTION
There comes a time in the journey of life when a man finds himself standing 
in the same muddy footprints he left as a child, gazing up at the same towering 
courthouse steps, and feeling that same sinking sensation in his chest. It’s a peculiar 
thing, this cycle of disappointment—to have lived it once as a bewildered child and 
then again as a rule-abiding adult. The faces change, the dates on the calendar 
advance, but the feeling remains as familiar as an old, worn book. 
Petitioner comes before this Court not with anger burning in his chest, nor 
with vindictiveness poisoning his pen, but rather with that quiet, heavy 
disappointment that settles in a person’s bones when they’ve done everything by

the book only to find the book itself has been shelved away, forgotten by those 
sworn to read from it.  
Petitioner followed the rules. He honored the procedures. He placed his faith 
in a system that promised justice would flow like water, clear and unobstructed, to 
those who seek it properly. He lived under the façade of facially void orders, and 
sustained extraordinary damages that were all caused intentionally by one person: 
the Respondent, who has sat in complete silence as this breakdown has continued 
to occur. 
Yet here stands Petitioner, a father twice removed—once from his home 
and once from his children—knocking on the courthouse door with papers properly 
filed, only to be told that the door shall remain closed because someone else might, 
at some future date, file papers at another door entirely. If this strikes the Court as 
a curious interpretation of justice, then we find ourselves in rare agreement. 
Mark Twain once observed that “the difference between the almost right word and 
the right word is really a large matter—it’s the difference between the lightning bug 
and the lightning.” In matters of law and children’s welfare, the difference between 
almost justice and actual justice is equally vast—it’s the difference between 
children thriving and children suffering, between a father’s presence and his 
absence, between following the law and merely gesturing toward it.  
The Petitioner is now in an extraordinary circumstance. On one hand, he 
must seek mandamus relief respectfully compelling this Court to fulfill its

and the lightning.” In matters of law and children’s welfare, the difference between
almost justice and actual justice is equally vast—it’s the difference between
children thriving and children suffering, between a father’s presence and his
absence, between following the law and merely gesturing toward it.

The Petitioner is now in an extraordinary circumstance. On one hand, he

must seek mandamus relief respectfully compelling this Court to fulfill its

ministerial duty to hear and rule on Petitioner’s properly filed emergency TRO, 
which this Court refused to hear on March 28, 2025. The refusal came not from any 
defect in the filing itself, but solely from representations made by opposing counsel 
regarding a future filing in another court which she abandoned—a procedural 
sleight of hand that has left children in distress and a father without an adequate 
remedy for an appeal. 
On the other hand, the Petitioner must prohibit the 322nd District Court from 
setting a matter for a hearing that cannot bear a valid result through a concurrent 
Writ of Prohibition. The proper procedure wasn’t followed, and cannot be 
overlooked in the face of an emergency. 
In essence, a procedurally improper forward-looking consolidation motion 
to be filed in a different court was used to block a properly filed emergency TRO 
before this court. The court cannot rule on a case not before it, and mandamus is 
the proper remedy here if this court refuses to act. Given the extraordinary 
circumstances of this matter, and given there has been no response or opposition to 
the relief being requested, the court should grant the emergency TRO 
immediately through a written order delivered to all the parties via the 
electronic filing manager, set the matter for a hearing 14 days from the signing of 
the order, and require a written response from the opposing party no later than 7 
days prior to the hearing.

Despite the circumstances of this case, Petitioner feels that settlement will 
and could be a possibility in the future, but the priority remains to rebuild the status 
quo of the children that has been destroyed and regain the ability to provide for his 
children financially while damages are assessed and attended to. Petitioner is at the 
very least entitled to this immediate relief.  He is not asking this court for anything 
more than what it has the discretion to do and what the law demands that it must do 
given the circumstances. This intent to file mandamus is filed out of respect and 
serves as a notice to all parties of record of my position on this matter. 
Such absurdity should end with an order from this court in Petitioner’s 
favor, and in support thereof, he shows the following unopposed facts: 
II. STATEMENT OF FACTS
1. On January 24, 2025, after more than 11 months of inaction, Petitioner
filed a Motion to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution. The divorce case no 
substantive action from Respondent since April 2024, a legal ghost ship drifting 
without direction or purpose. That motion wasn’t attempted to be set for hearing 
until September of 2024, only after the Petitioner exhausted all efforts seeking 
relief throughout the Texas Judiciary without any participation from the opposing 
side. 
2. On March 19, 2025, driven by mounting concerns about the children’s
welfare and learning that the 322nd District Court did not have continuous, 
exclusive jurisdiction over the children in this matter, Petitioner filed a new

SAPCR in this Court (Cause No. 233-765358-25) seeking emergency relief for 
the children. The very next day, March 20, 2025, Ms. Carter suddenly reappeared 
like a character presumed missing in the second act, filing an answer to the 
SAPCR petition in this Court and thereby submitting to this Court’s jurisdiction 
by filing a response rather than a motion to abate. 
3. On March 21, 2025, Petitioner filed a verified Rule 12 motion
challenging Ms. Carter’s authority to represent Respondent in this matter—the 
second such challenge, met with the same resounding silence as the first. 
4. On March 25, 2025, Petitioner filed an Objection to Consolidation and
an Ex-Parte Emergency Motion for TRO. Two days later, on March 27, 2025, 
Petitioner contacted the court coordinator, requested a date and time to present the 
motion, and served the documents to the opposing party with the intent to present 
on March 28, 2025, at 9:00 A.M. before the Associate Judge of this Court. On that 
fateful morning of March 28, 2025, Petitioner drove to the courthouse, paid for 
parking, met with the coordinator, communicated with opposing counsel, and 
secured a hearing date of April 10, 2025. Petitioner then proceeded to the 
Associate Judge’s courtroom to present the TRO. 
5. Before Petitioner could present his case—before he could speak a single
word about his children’s welfare—he was told that Ms. Carter would be filing a 
motion to consolidate in the 322nd District Court, that his motion was improperly 
before the court, and that the Associate Judge refused to hear the motion. It was a

curious thing, this refusal. Ms. Carter wasn’t even present in the courtroom, yet 
her words carried more weight than Petitioner’s physical presence, his properly 
filed papers, and most importantly, the urgent needs of his children. She stopped 
the proceedings with nothing more than word of mouth for the incorrect motion. 
A true showcasing of disregard for the process, and the children. 
6. On April 2, 2025, Petitioner filed a Pre-Objection to Motion to
Consolidate in the 322nd District Court. Ms. Carter’s motion to consolidate wasn’t 
filed with the 322nd District Court until April 3, 2025—six days after she used its 
mere possibility to prevent this Court from hearing Petitioner’s emergency 
motion. Her motion disregarded Petitioner’s pre-objection entirely, as if it were 
invisible ink on the page. 
7. On April 4, 2025, unable to acquire a ruling due to Petitioner’s
objection, Ms. Carter attempted to set the motion for a hearing before the 322nd 
District Court. That same day, Petitioner filed a Pre-Objection to Motion to 
Transfer in this Court, given that a motion to transfer must come before any 
attempt at consolidation. Ms. Carter, who had been so urgently concerned about 
consolidation when it served to block Petitioner’s emergency hearing, suddenly 
claimed to be unavailable until late April—causing significant delays that could 
have been avoided had this Court simply heard the motion before it on March 28, 
2025.

8. Throughout this period of procedural maneuvering, the children have
been subjected to psychological manipulation and medical neglect. They have 
been removed from Petitioner’s care and placed with elderly great-grandparents 
on a daily basis, and are being gaslighted into a false belief that the divorce is 
finalized. Petitioner’s eldest child’s academic performance has plummeted, and 
both children have become emotionally estranged from both parents. Petitioner 
has suffered approximately $110,500 in verifiable financial damages due to being 
locked out of his home and business, and it grows each day. But the financial toll 
pales in comparison to the emotional cost of watching Petitioner’s children suffer 
while the courts exchange procedurally incorrect volleys over his head.  
III. ARGUMENT
A. The Court's Ministerial Duty
9. It is well-established Texas law that a trial court has a ministerial
duty—not a discretionary duty—to consider and rule upon motions properly filed 
and pending before it. In re Sheppard, 193 S.W.3d 181, 183 (Tex. App.—Houston 
[1st Dist.] 2006, orig. proceeding); In re Chavez, 62 S.W.3d 225, 228 (Tex. 
App.—Amarillo 2001, orig. proceeding). The Texas Supreme Court has 
consistently held that while a court has discretion in how it rules on a motion, it 
has no discretion to refuse to rule at all. In re Blakeney, 254 S.W.3d 659, 661 
(Tex. App.—Texarkana 2008, orig. proceeding) ("When a motion is properly

consistently held that while a court has discretion in how it rules on a motion, it
has no discretion to refuse to rule at all. In re Blakeney, 254 S.W.3d 659, 661

motion is a ministerial act, and mandamus may issue to compel the trial judge to 
act."). 
10. This principle is not merely a procedural nicety but a fundamental
cornerstone of our judicial system. When a court refuses to hear a properly filed 
motion, it effectively denies access to justice itself. As the Texas courts have 
repeatedly emphasized, "A trial court's refusal to rule on a pending motion within 
a reasonable amount of time constitutes a clear abuse of discretion." In re Bonds, 
57 S.W.3d 456, 457 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2001, orig. proceeding). This 
abuse is magnified exponentially when the motion concerns the welfare of 
children and seeks emergency relief. 
11. The Court's refusal to hear Petitioner's properly filed emergency TRO
on March 28, 2025, constitutes a clear failure to perform a ministerial duty. This 
failure is particularly concerning given that: 
a) The motion was properly filed and noticed for hearing and the parties agreed
on a date and time set for April 10th, 2025; 
b) Petitioner communicated with court staff, physically appeared at the
courthouse ready to present the motion and was told he could present his 
motion; 
c) The motion concerned the immediate welfare of children; and
d) The refusal was based solely on representations about a future filing in
another court that had not yet occurred.

B. Clear Abuse of Discretion
12. A writ of mandamus is appropriate when a trial court clearly abuses its
discretion and there is no adequate remedy by appeal. In re Prudential Ins. Co. of 
Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 135-36 (Tex. 2004); Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 
840 (Tex. 1992). An abuse if discretion is clearly established from point one 
below, and supported by points two through eight: 
i. First, it refused to perform its ministerial duty to hear and
rule on a properly filed motion based solely on representations 
about a future filing in another court. It’s as if a doctor refused to 
treat a bleeding patient because another doctor might, at some 
future date, claim the patient should be treated at a different 
hospital. 
ii. Second, it failed to recognize that by answering the
SAPCR petition in this Court, Respondent submitted to this 
Court’s jurisdiction and should have instead filed a motion to abate 
or should have moved to transfer the case. The law doesn’t allow 
for half-measures of jurisdiction. 
iii. Third, it failed to recognize that this Court maintained
jurisdiction until any transfer was completed pursuant to Texas 
Family Code § 155.005(d) as no final order has been rendered in 
the 322nd District Court. Jurisdiction isn’t a hot potato to be

iv. Fourth, it failed to recognize that the proper procedure
for consolidation of cases in different courts requires a motion to 
transfer to be filed and granted before any motion to consolidate 
can be considered, pursuant to Texas Family Code §§ 155.201 and 
6.407. The law provides a sequence, a proper order of operations, 
that cannot be reversed or circumvented without creating 
procedural delay, which is what the emergency TRO sought to 
prevent from occurring. 
v. Fifth, it allowed opposing counsel to circumvent proper
legal procedure by influencing this Court’s decision without being

vii. Seventh, it failed to recognize that the Associate
Judge’s orders in the divorce case were never properly adopted by 
the referring District Court as required by Texas Family Code § 
201.013(b). An unadopted order is like an unsigned check—it may 
look official, but it carries no legal weight, yet it has been used to 
bar the Petitioner from his residence, business, and children, and 
impose a disruptive and chaotic schedule upon the children. 
viii. Eighth, and perhaps most troublingly, it disregarded
the children’s best interests in favor of procedural considerations, 
contrary to Texas Family Code § 153.002 and has languished for 
over a year due to the opposition’s failure to prosecute. 
12. The law is clear that in matters involving children, their welfare must

Petitioner’s children are suffering immediate and ongoing harm while procedural 
issues remain unresolved. In re Texas Dep’t of Family & Protective Servs., 255 
S.W.3d 613, 615 (Tex. 2008) (granting emergency relief where children’s welfare 
was at immediate risk). Petitioner’s children are being alienated from him, 
causing long-term psychological damage that cannot be undone by a favorable 
ruling months or years in the future. In re Scheller, 325 S.W.3d 640, 643 (Tex. 
2010) (recognizing that interference with the parent-child relationship can 
constitute irreparable harm). 
14. The improper procedural maneuvers by opposing counsel are causing
significant delays that cannot be remedied through the normal appellate process. 
Each day that passes is another day the children suffer, another day their academic 
performance declines, another day they become more emotionally estranged in a 
situation that the law should’ve prevented from existing to begin with. 
15. Temporary orders in family law cases are generally not appealable,
leaving Petitioner in a procedural trap with no exit. Waiting for a final judgment 
to appeal would allow the improper procedural tactics to succeed, causing 
irreparable harm to Petitioner and his children. 
16. Void orders are being enforced against Petitioner, causing ongoing
harm that cannot be adequately remedied by appeal. In re Sw. Bell Tel. Co., 35 
S.W.3d 602, 605 (Tex. 2000). Petitioner is caught in a procedural echo

with no effective remedy, as both courts have effectively denied him access to the 
judicial system. In re Team Rocket, L.P., 256 S.W.3d 257, 262 (Tex. 2008).  
D. Opposing Counsel’s Contradictory Behavior
17. Cooper L. Carter’s contradictory behavior warrants particular
attention, like a character in a novel whose actions never quite align with their 
words: She zealously defended her client by filing an answer to the SAPCR in this 
Court, thereby submitting to this Court’s jurisdiction, only to then influence this 
Court to refuse to hear Petitioner’s properly filed motion by representing that she 
would file a motion to consolidate in the 322nd Court, which would be moot by 
statute. 
18. She had abandoned the divorce case for nearly a year, filing nothing
since April 24, 2024, only to suddenly reappear precisely when I sought 
emergency relief for the children—like a firefighter who ignores a smoldering 
house for months, only to rush in when someone else calls for help. She failed to 
respond to a Rule 12 motion challenging her authority to represent 
the Respondent, her silence speaking volumes about the nature of her 
representation. She subsequently filed an improper motion to consolidate in the 
322nd Court without first filing the required motion to transfer, putting the 
procedural cart before the horse. She is now claiming unavailability until late 
April in the 322nd Court, creating unnecessary delay after using the urgency of 
consolidation to block Petitioner’s emergency hearing.

19. This pattern demonstrates a tactical attempt to manipulate both courts’
dockets to prevent me from obtaining a timely hearing on Petitioner’s properly 
filed emergency motion. It’s a shell game played with the children’s welfare as 
the prize. This Court should not allow itself to be used as an instrument in such 
procedural gamesmanship, particularly when it involves a failure to perform a 
ministerial duty required by law and when children’s welfare is at stake. 
IV. CONCLUSION
This Court’s refusal to hear Petitioner’s properly filed motion constitutes a 
failure to perform a ministerial duty for which there is no adequate remedy 
by appeal. The proper legal procedure requires a motion to transfer to be 
filed and granted before any motion to consolidate can be considered, and by 
answering the SAPCR petition in this Court, Respondent submitted to this 
Court’s jurisdiction. 
The children who are the subject of this proceeding are suffering 
immediate and ongoing harm while procedural issues remain unresolved. Each 
day that passes without addressing the emergency concerns raised in Petitioner’s 
TRO is a day of certain damage to the children’s psychological well-being and 
development. 
Petitioner once heard it said that the true measure of a society is found in 
how it treats its most vulnerable members. By that measure, the procedural 
labyrinth that has prevented this Court from hearing Petitioner’s emergency

motion speaks volumes about how far we have strayed from the ideal of justice. 
The children— innocent, vulnerable, and deserving of the Court’s protection—
have instead become collateral damage in a game of procedural chess. 
Petitioner provides this petition not out of anger or vindictiveness, but out 
of that quiet, heavy disappointment that settles in a person’s bones when they’ve 
done everything by the book only to find the book itself has been shelved away. 
Petitioner followed the rules. He reiterates that he honored the procedures. He 
placed his faith in a system that promised justice would flow like water, clear and 
unobstructed, to those who seek it properly. 
Petitioner asks this Court to remember that behind every case number, 
behind every filing, behind every procedural rule, there are often real children 
with real lives that continue whether the courts act or not. Time doesn’t stop for 
them while adults sort out procedural disagreements. They grow, they hurt, they 
form memories and impressions that will shape them for a lifetime. 
As Mark Twain might have observed, the difference between justice 
served and justice delayed is the difference between a father’s presence and his 
absence, between children thriving and children suffering, between following the 
law and merely gesturing toward it.
