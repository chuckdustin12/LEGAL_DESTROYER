Cooper,
I've already objected.
You have no legal authority to do so until you address my objection filed and served to you.
Furthermore, you have not sent the Notice required by rule 237a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and have not
shown you authority to represent the Petitioner in this matter.
Finally, you claimed to have been retained in your individual capacity yet are claiming Marx Altman and Johnson is filing
pleadings on your behalf, and Roderick D. Marx is not a party in this suit nor has he made a formal appearance.
You're well aware of these obligations, and any order resulting from this motion will be challenged via the proper legal
proceedings.
You cannot continue to disregard the rules of procedure, fail to respond to motions or evidence served to you, and
continue to expect favors from the bench in leu of you performing your duties as a licensed attorneys.
You are put on notice that if any such motion is presented to the court in the face of the above facts or the unanswered
objection already served to you, I will move for your disqualification immediately and will provide the Texas OAG with your
information and detailed misconduct as well as the State Bar of Texas.
Further, you have not provided or served a copy of the proposed order which you intend to present, which is required.
This conversation will be filed and made apart of the official court record. 
Respectfully submitted,
Charles Myers
