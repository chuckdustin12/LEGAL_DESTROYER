MOTION TO ABATE
Background
This matter is currently set for trial on June 20, 2023.  On February 23, 2023, the 13th Court 
of Appeals in Corpus Christi issued an opinion in 13-21-00167-CV, Stephen Pruski v. Texas 
Windstorm Insurance Association, addressing an issue of first impression in the state of Texas, an 
issue that directly impacts this court’s jurisdiction. 
Defendant TWIA is a quasi-governmental entity created by the Texas Legislature in 1971 
to be the windstorm insurer of last resort for Texas’ fourteen coastal counties and parts of Harris 
County.  In 2011, the Texas legislature passed House Bill No. 3 (“HB3”), which was signed by 
Governor Perry on July 19, 2011, and became effective September 28, 2011.  HB3 revised Chapter 
2210 of the Texas Insurance Code, which governs the operation of TWIA.    
Among the many changes to Chapter 2210 is the requirement that an action brought in state 
court for a denied claim be presided over by a judge appointed by the Multi-District Litigation

I. MOTION TO ABATE
Background

This matter is currently set for trial on June 20, 2023. On February 23, 2023, the 13" Court
of Appeals in Corpus Christi issued an opinion in 13-21-00167-CV, Stephen Pruski v. Texas
Windstorm Insurance Association, addressing an issue of first impression in the state of Texas, an
issue that directly impacts this court’s jurisdiction.

Defendant TWIA is a quasi-governmental entity created by the Texas Legislature in 1971
to be the windstorm insurer of last resort for Texas’ fourteen coastal counties and parts of Harris
County. In 2011, the Texas legislature passed House Bill No. 3 (“HB3”), which was signed by
Governor Perry on July 19, 2011, and became effective September 28, 2011. HB3 revised Chapter
2210 of the Texas Insurance Code, which governs the operation of TWIA.

Among the many changes to Chapter 2210 is the requirement that an action brought in state
court for a denied claim be presided over by a judge appointed by the Multi-District Litigation

Panel.  Tex. Ins. Code, §2210.575(e), attached as Exhibit A.  The statute further requires that the 
appointed judge be an active judge who is a resident of the county in which the loss occurred or of 
a first-tier coastal county (such as Galveston County) or a second tier coastal county adjacent to 
the county in which the loss occurred.  Id.  While the judge of this court meets the latter 
requirement, he does not meet the former requirement as he was not appointed by the MDL panel.  
In Pruski, a Motion for Summary was granted in favor of TWIA, dismissing the suit.  
Plaintiff appealed to the 13th Court of Appeals on several grounds, one of which was that the trial 
court failed to meet the statutory requirements for presiding over the matter.  The Court of Appeals 
noted the significance of the argument: 
Pruski challenges the presiding judge’s authority to preside over this TWIA suit because 
the judge was never appointed by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (MDL 
Panel) in accordance with § 2210.575(e) of the insurance code. See TEX. INS. CODE 
ANN. § 2210.575(e). This is an issue of first impression and one which requires us to 
analyze the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association Act (the TWIA Act) to determine 
whether § 2210.575(e) imposes a judicial exclusivity. 
See Opinion, attached as Ex. B., at 3.  The Court went on to note that the MDL had not yet had 
the opportunity to address the assignment of judges in cases against TWIA under the statute.  Id. 
at 3-4. 
The parties disputed the effect of the presiding judge not being appointed by the MDL 
panel.  Was the error, if it was error, waivable or not?  The Court ultimately held that section 
2210.575(e) of the Texas Insurance Code is mandatory and requires the MDL Panel to appoint the 
presiding judge in every case against TWIA, regardless of whether multidistrict litigation is 
involved.  Because the presiding judge in the case was not appointed by the MDL Panel but was 
assigned in the usual course upon the filing of a new lawsuit, the judge lacked “judicial authority” 
to preside over the case.  The Court concluded that the trial court’s ultimate judgment was therefore 
“void” and not waivable.  Id. at 13.

The potential impact of this ruling is significant and far-reaching.  If it stands, then it could 
be argued that the opinion effectively nullifies every order in numerous pending cases against 
TWIA, and it nullifies the judgments in hundreds of other past cases litigated since 2011.  It further 
renders void prospectively any ruling made by any judge not appointed by the MDL panel, 
including rulings and judgments from this Court.  It certainly provides the losing party in the trial 
of this matter the opportunity to complain after the judgment is entered that such judgment is void.  
While the effect of the opinion is mandatory in those counties within the 13th Court of Appeals’ 
district, it has precedential value in the other counties as it is the only decision regarding this issue 
in the state of Texas.   
TWIA filed a Motion for En Banc Reconsideration of the 13th Court of Appeals’ decision 
in Pruski.  Attached as Exhibit C.  It has been granted and the parties are in the briefing stage. 
However, a decision is not expected by the time this matter is called for trial during the April 
docket.   
II.
MOTION TO ABATE/MOTION FOR CONTINUANCE
Defendant moves for entry of an order abating this matter until there is a final resolution 
of whether this Court has jurisdiction over this matter.  Defendant is concerned that, if the Pruski 
decision is allowed to stand, any judgment arising from a trial will be void, and these parties’ and 
this Court’s resources will have been expended for naught. 
If this Court is not inclined to abate this matter until an indefinite date, then Defendant 
requests a continuance of at least six months at which time this issue can be revisited, if necessary.

Pro se appellant Stephen Pruski sued appellee Texas Windstorm Insurance 
Association (TWIA) complaining that appellee “improperly denied portions of [his] claim 
for damages from Hurricane Harvey.” See TEX. INS. CODE ANN. §§ 2210.001–.705. TWIA 
filed a traditional motion for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. By four 
issues, Pruski argues that the trial court (1) “failed to meet requirements of [the] statute 
for [a] presiding judge,” (2) denied Pruski “reasonable access to all information relevant” 
to the case, (3) improperly excluded Pruski’s “evidentiary filings in opposition to statutory 
language,” and (4) abused its discretion in granting TWIA’s motion for summary judgment. 
We reverse and remand. 
I. 
BACKGROUND 
Pruski’s condominium was damaged when Hurricane Harvey struck Corpus Christi 
in August 2017. Pruski’s property was insured under a hail and windstorm policy with 
TWIA, and Pruski filed a claim with TWIA under the policy on August 28, 2017. Following 
another rainstorm which purportedly caused damage to recently repaired areas, Pruski 
filed an additional claim with TWIA on December 12, 2017. TWIA issued its notice 
accepting coverage in part for both claims. However, TWIA declined coverage for the 
reported damages to the drywall on the perimeter walls and ceilings. Pruski served TWIA 
with a timely notice of intent to sue and subsequently filed suit, seeking recovery for the 
damages denied by TWIA. See id. § 2210.575(a). 
Pruski thereafter filed a motion for traditional summary judgment, which the trial 
court denied. Pruski then filed a motion for recusal, questioning the judge’s impartiality 
under Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 18b. Pruski’s motion additionally cited to

for damages from Hurricane Harvey.” See TEX. INS. CODE ANN. §§ 2210.001—.705. TWIA
filed a traditional motion for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. By four
issues, Pruski argues that the trial court (1) “failed to meet requirements of [the] statute
for [a] presiding judge,” (2) denied Pruski “reasonable access to all information relevant”
to the case, (3) improperly excluded Pruski’s “evidentiary filings in opposition to statutory
language,” and (4) abused its discretion in granting TWIA’s motion for summary judgment.
We reverse and remand.

I. BACKGROUND

Pruski’s condominium was damaged when Hurricane Harvey struck Corpus Christi
in August 2017. Pruski’s property was insured under a hail and windstorm policy with
TWIA, and Pruski filed a claim with TWIA under the policy on August 28, 2017. Following
another rainstorm which purportedly caused damage to recently repaired areas, Pruski
filed an additional claim with TWIA on December 12, 2017. TWIA issued its notice
accepting coverage in part for both claims. However, TWIA declined coverage for the
reported damages to the drywall on the perimeter walls and ceilings. Pruski served TWIA
with a timely notice of intent to sue and subsequently filed suit, seeking recovery for the
damages denied by TWIA. See id. § 2210.575(a).

Pruski thereafter filed a motion for traditional summary judgment, which the trial
court denied. Pruski then filed a motion for recusal, questioning the judge’s impartiality

under Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 18b. Pruski’s motion additionally cited to

§ 2210.575(e) of the Texas Insurance Code as the “statute that is the genesis of this 
motion.”2 See id. § 2210.575(e) (setting forth requirements for the appointment of a judge 
over TWIA Act suits). A judge assigned by the regional administrative judge to consider 
Pruski’s motion denied the motion. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 18a(g). 
On March 10, 2021, TWIA filed a traditional summary judgment motion, arguing 
that “[a]s a matter of law, no coverage is owed” because Pruski’s “insurance policy only 
covers personal property and certain personal property that becomes affixed to his 
condominium”—which does not include drywall composing perimeter walls. The trial court 
granted TWIA’s motion for summary judgment and ordered that Pruski recover nothing 
from TWIA. This appeal followed. 
II. 
DISCUSSION 
By his first issue, which we find dispositive, see TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1, Pruski 
challenges the presiding judge’s authority to preside over this TWIA suit because the 
judge was never appointed by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (MDL Panel) in 
accordance with § 2210.575(e) of the insurance code. See TEX. INS. CODE ANN. 
§ 2210.575(e). This is an issue of first impression and one which requires us to analyze 
the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association Act (the TWIA Act) to determine whether 
§ 2210.575(e) imposes a judicial exclusivity. See TEX. INS. CODE ANN. §§ 2210.001–.705; 
see also TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. §§ 74.161–.164 (Court Administration Act, Subchapter H, 
“Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation”); see generally In re Tex. Windstorm Ins. Ass’n. 
 
2 TWIA acknowledges in its brief that “[t]he real substance of Pruski’s motion to recuse was that 
the presiding judge should have been appointed by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ([MDL 
Panel]), as contemplated in [§ 2210.]575(e) of the TWIA Act.” See TEX. INS. CODE ANN. § 2210.575(e).

In our determination of whether to depart from the ubiquitous meaning of “shall”—
specifically, to decide whether the Legislature’s use of “shall” constituted a conferment of 
exclusive judicial authority—we are confronted with a glaring omission in the statute: 
Section 2210.575 contains no guidance regarding the procedure necessary to initiate 
MDL Panel assignment. See generally TEX. INS. CODE ANN. § 2210.575 (setting forth a 
claimant’s notice requirements, establishing TWIA’s right to seek alternative dispute 
resolution, and requiring a court to abate “an action against [TWIA] . . . until the notice of 
intent to bring an action has been provided and, if requested by the association, the 
dispute has been submitted to alternative dispute resolution, in accordance with this 
section”). In contrast to Rule 13.3 proceedings, which places the onus on a party or court 
to request MDL Panel-intervention before appointment is considered and ordered, 
§ 2210.575 contains no such triggering provision. Compare TEX. R. JUD. ADMIN. 13.3 with 
TEX. INS. CODE ANN. § 2210.575(e). Section 2210.575(e) simply appears to necessitate—
without instruction as to how it is to be effectuated or by whom—that the MDL Panel must 
appoint a judge in TWIA Act filings. See TEX. INS. CODE ANN. § 2210.575(e); In re Tex. 
Windstorm Ins. Ass’n. Harvey Litig., No. 19-0472, at *1 (concluding that a “plain reading” 
of § 2210.575 requires that the MDL Panel appoint a judge in TWIA Act proceedings and 
explicitly “forecloses the assignment” of judges otherwise authorized to preside under 
Rule 13.6(a)). It is in partial consideration of this statutory silence that TWIA advances its 
interpretation of the provision as one akin to a venue challenge—i.e., waived if not timely 
asserted and otherwise unobstructive on a court’s authority to preside over a cause or 
render judgment.

Section 2210.575 contains no guidance regarding the procedure necessary to initiate
MDL Panel assignment. See generally TEX. INS. CODE ANN. § 2210.575 (setting forth a
claimant’s notice requirements, establishing TWIA’s right to seek alternative dispute
resolution, and requiring a court to abate “an action against [TWIA] . . . until the notice of
intent to bring an action has been provided and, if requested by the association, the
dispute has been submitted to alternative dispute resolution, in accordance with this
section”). In contrast to Rule 13.3 proceedings, which places the onus on a party or court
to request MDL Panel-intervention before appointment is considered and ordered,
§ 2210.575 contains no such triggering provision. Compare TEX. R. JUD. ADMIN. 13.3 with
TEX. INS. CODE ANN. § 2210.575(e). Section 2210.575(e) simply appears to necessitate—
without instruction as to how it is to be effectuated or by wnom—that the MDL Panel must
appoint a judge in TWIA Act filings. See TEX. INS. CODE ANN. § 2210.575(e); In re Tex.
Windstorm Ins. Ass’n. Harvey Litig., No. 19-0472, at *1 (concluding that a “plain reading”
of § 2210.575 requires that the MDL Panel appoint a judge in TWIA Act proceedings and
explicitly “forecloses the assignment” of judges otherwise authorized to preside under
Rule 13.6(a)). It is in partial consideration of this statutory silence that TWIA advances its
interpretation of the provision as one akin to a venue challenge—i.e., waived if not timely
asserted and otherwise unobstructive on a court’s authority to preside over a cause or

render judgment.

For reasons explored infra, it would be in contravention to the statute’s objectives 
and legislative history for us to conclude that § 2210.575(e) does not carry a mandatory 
prescription. The legislature has broad authority to restrict a courts’ jurisdictional purview, 
and legislative limitations to a trial court’s judicial authority “need not be express.” S.C. v. 
M.B., 650 S.W.3d 428, 436 (Tex. 2022); see, e.g., In re Champion Indus. Sales, LLC, 398 
S.W.3d 812, 820–21 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi–Edinburg 2012, orig. proceeding) 
(concluding, in an application of Rule 13.6 on a non-TWIA Act proceeding, that “although 
the 333rd District Court is a court of general jurisdiction by virtue of the statutes that 
created it, when the 333rd District Court is acting pursuant to the MDL panel’s designation 
as a pretrial court under MDL rules and legislation, by reference to those rules, it is not a 
court of general jurisdiction”). Moreover, the presumption that courts of general 
jurisdiction have subject matter jurisdiction over a matter, unless a showing can be made 
to the contrary, “does not apply to actions grounded in statute rather than the common 
law.” In re Champion Indus. Sales, 398 S.W.3d at 820. It is against this backdrop, that we 
analyze the history and purpose of § 2210.575. See S.C., 650 S.W.3d at 436; see also

the statute’s assignment requirement, we reject TWIA’s contention that Pruski’s failure to 
timely file a request for appointment constituted a waiver of his complaint. 
Having concluded such provision is mandatory and restrictive of a judge’s authority 
to preside over TWIA Act suits, we must also conclude the presiding judge was without 
authority to render judgment in this cause. See generally Dubai Petroleum Co. v. Kazi, 
12 S.W.3d 71, 74–75 (Tex. 2000) (“A judgment may properly be rendered against a party 
only if the court has authority to adjudicate the type of controversy involved in the action.”) 
(cleaned up). The judgment is therefore void. See In re D.S., 602 S.W.3d at 512 (“A 
judgment is void, rather than voidable, when it is apparent that the court rendering 
judgment had no jurisdiction over the parties or property, no jurisdiction over the subject 
matter, no jurisdiction to enter the particular judgment, or no capacity to act.”) (cleaned 
up); cf. Comm’n for Law. Discipline v. Schaefer, 364 S.W.3d 831, 836 (Tex. 2012) (per

We reverse the trial court’s judgment and remand with instructions to vacate and

I. Introduction

This is an appeal of an ordinary summary judgment in an insurance coverage
action against TWIA. But the ruling issued in this case is anything but ordinary.
On February 23, 2023, a panel of this Court consisting of Justices Silva, Longoria,
and Pefia (the “Panel”) issued an Opinion that effectively invalidates every
judgment and ruling in nearly every case involving TWIA since September 28,
2011. The Panel held that section 2210.575(e) of the Texas Insurance Code
requires the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation (“MDL Panel’) to appoint the

September 2011), the judge lacked “judicial authority” to preside over the case and
the court’s ultimate judgment is therefore “void.” Op. at 13 (attached).

The Panel’s ruling is extraordinary because it nullifies orders issued in

cases, the Panel’s ruling will give one or both parties the ability avoid any prior 
rulings and get a “do-over” because the court’s actions are all null and void. And 
the Panel’s ruling is contrary to well-established law in Texas, including authority 
from this Court, holding that the error, if any, in the manner of appointing the 
presiding judge renders the judgment voidable at most. This Court should 
reconsider this case en banc to align this Court’s decisions and prevent the 
uncertainty and confusion that will follow from the Panel’s Opinion.

(the “TWIA Act”). See id., Subchapter L-1. Under the TWIA Act, most disputes

appraisal, while disputes over coverage of a loss may be resolved through 
litigation, subject to limitations, after certain statutory prerequisites are met. See id.

case “shall be presided over by a judge appointed by the judicial panel on 
multidistrict litigation designated under Section 74.161, Government Code.” Id.

This case is the same. Plaintiff-Appellant Stephen Pruski (“Pruski”) filed 
suit against TWIA in Nueces County on June 22, 2020, complaining that TWIA 
did not pay for some water damage to his condominium in Port Aransas. CR 1. The 
case was assigned to the 117th District Court, Hon. Sandra Watts presiding, and 
despite knowing of the MDL-appointment provision, Pruski did not object and 
filed a motion for summary judgment, asking Judge Watts to decide the merits of 
the case in his favor. CR 577.3 Judge Watts denied Pruski’s motion and later 
granted summary judgment for TWIA. CR 924, 1382.  
After Pruski’s summary judgment strategy failed, he moved to recuse Judge 
Watts, claiming she was biased and unqualified. CR 1048. Pruski’s arguments did 
not suggest any bias or lack of qualification; it was based on the simple fact that 
Judge Watts was not appointed by the MDL Panel. CR 1049-50. Judge Watts was 
the presiding judge in the proper district, and she was qualified for appointment

(Hon. Carlos Valdez) denied it. CR 1083, 1084.  
On appeal of the final summary judgment, Pruski argued, among other 
things, that Judge Watts was not “qualified” to preside over this case because she 
was not appointed by the MDL Panel. Pruski Br. at 17-19. TWIA argued in 
response that Judge Watts was qualified under the law, and under the criteria in 
section 2210.575(e), and that Pruski waived any complaint that Judge Watts was 
not appointed by the MDL Panel by failing to request that the MDL Panel appoint 
a different judge and failing to object to Judge Watts deciding the case until after 
she denied his motion for summary judgment. TWIA Br. at 8-12.

parties and subject-matter, and of whether Judge Watts was qualified to preside in 
that court, the Panel held that Judge Watts lacked “judicial authority” to preside 
over the case because the cause of action is statutory, and under mandatory

III. 
The Panel’s Opinion is contrary to clearly established law.  
The Panel’s holding that the trial court’s judgment is void is contrary to 
established Texas law. Under Texas law, there are two ways a judgment could be 
rendered void. First, a judgment may be void “when it is apparent that the court 
rendering the judgment had no jurisdiction of the parties, no jurisdiction of the 
subject matter, no jurisdiction to enter the judgment, or no capacity to act as a 
court.” Mapco, Inc. v. Forrest, 795 S.W.2d 700, 703 (Tex. 1990). Second, a 
judgment may be void if the presiding judge was not qualified to serve as a judge 
or was constitutionally or statutorily disqualified from serving as a judge in the 
case. Tesco Am., Inc. v. Strong Indus., Inc., 221 S.W.3d 550, 555 (Tex. 2006); 
Wilson v. State, 977 S.W.2d 379, 380 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998); Davis v. State, 956 
S.W.2d 555, 559 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997). Absent one of these circumstances, 
errors of law or procedure only render the judgment voidable and subject to 
possible reversal on appeal—not void. Davis, 956 S.W.2d at 559; Mapco, 795 
S.W.2d at 703.  
None of these circumstances are present here. The court below—the 117th 
District Court of Nueces County, a court of general jurisdiction—had jurisdiction 
over the subject matter and the parties; the presiding judge—Hon. Sandra Watts—
was the duly elected and sworn judge presiding in that court; and there is no 
evidence or allegation that Judge Watts was constitutionally or statutorily

disqualified. Therefore, under controlling Texas law, the judgment could not be 
“void,” as the Panel held.  
A. 
The trial court had jurisdiction.  
As noted above, there has been no showing that the 117th District Court of 
Nueces County somehow lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter of this case, 
lacked jurisdiction over the parties, or lacked the capacity to act as a court. In fact, 
under the TWIA Act, Pruski was required to file his case in the district court of 
Nueces County because the property in question is in Nueces County. See TEX. 
INS. CODE § 2210.575(e) (suit must be filed “in a district court in the county in 
which the loss that is the subject of the coverage denial occurred”).  
To find that the judgment here is “void,” the Panel suggests that the 
Legislature intended to limit the district court’s jurisdiction. See Op. at 10-12. The 
Panel cited legislative history on the 2011 amendments to the TWIA Act (the 
amendments that added section 2210.575(e)), which indicates that the Legislature 
intended to limit litigation against TWIA and encourage more uniform claims 
handling. Id. These points are accurate, but it is unclear how they support the

disqualified. Therefore, under controlling Texas law, the judgment could not be
“void,” as the Panel held.

A. The trial court had jurisdiction.

As noted above, there has been no showing that the 117th District Court of
Nueces County somehow lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter of this case,
lacked jurisdiction over the parties, or lacked the capacity to act as a court. In fact,
under the TWIA Act, Pruski was required to file his case in the district court of
Nueces County because the property in question is in Nueces County. See TEX.
INS. CODE § 2210.575(e) (suit must be filed “in a district court in the county in
which the loss that is the subject of the coverage denial occurred”).

To find that the judgment here is “void,” the Panel suggests that the
Legislature intended to limit the district court’s jurisdiction. See Op. at 10-12. The
Panel cited legislative history on the 2011 amendments to the TWIA Act (the
amendments that added section 2210.575(e)), which indicates that the Legislature
intended to limit litigation against TWIA and encourage more uniform claims
handling. Jd. These points are accurate, but it is unclear how they support the
conclusion that the Legislature intended for the MDL-appointment provision to
limit the district court’s jurisdiction. There is simply nothing in the statute or the

legislative history to support that conclusion.

The cases cited by the Panel also do not support that conclusion. The 
principal case the Panel relied upon was S.C. v. M.B., 650 S.W.3d 428 (Tex. 2022). 
See Op. at 10, 12. In S.C., the Texas Supreme Court considered whether a 
provision in the Texas Family Code creating a statutory right of action for dividing 
marital property after a divorce decree has become final was exclusive and 
displaced similar remedies available for partitioning property under the Texas 
Property Code. 650 S.W.3d at 434. One of the parties argued that the Family Code 
remedy was exclusive and conferred exclusive jurisdiction on the original divorce 
court over such matters, while the other argued that the Family Code provision 
merely provided an alternative remedy to traditional partition under the Property 
Code. Id. at 435.  
In rejecting the argument that the Family Code provision was exclusive and 
jurisdictional, the Texas Supreme Court stated:  
The legislature has broad authority to displace existing remedies and 
to restrict district courts’ subject-matter jurisdiction. Such limitations 
need not be express, but “[w]e resist classifying a provision as 
jurisdictional absent clear legislative intent to that effect.” 
Crosstex Energy Servs., L.P. v. Pro Plus, Inc., 430 S.W.3d 384, 391 
(Tex. 2014). Absent a compelling showing to the contrary, we 
presume that remedies remain intact and that the jurisdiction of a 
district court—our state’s sole court of general jurisdiction—
remains undisturbed. See, e.g., Tex. Const. art. V, § 8; In re Oncor 
Elec. Delivery Co., 630 S.W.3d 40, 44 (Tex. 2021). As the U.S. 
Supreme Court recently put it, “[w]here multiple plausible 
interpretations exist—only one of which is jurisdictional—it is 
difficult to make the case that the jurisdictional reading is clear.”

To satisfy the clear-statement rule, the jurisdictional condition 
must be just that: clear.” Id. at 1499. 
Id. at 436 (bold emphasis added). Because the statute did not expressly provide that 
the Family Code remedy was exclusive, or that the divorce court shall have 
exclusive jurisdiction, and the overall legal context did not clearly and necessarily 
imply that the Legislature intended to create a jurisdictional limitation, the Texas 
Supreme Court held it was not. Id. at 437-52. 
The key holding in S.C. is that a statutory provision will not be read to create 
a jurisdictional limitation, even if that is a reasonable interpretation of the statute, 
unless it is clearly what the Legislature intended. But the Panel Opinion glosses 
over the language highlighted above and finds merely that it “stands to reason” that 
the Legislature would intend to create a jurisdictional limitation with the MDL-

op.)—a case applying the same version of the TWIA Act at issue here. In Park, 
TWIA argued that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the plaintiff’s claims 
against it because the TWIA Act’s remedies are “exclusive,” and the TWIA Act 
prohibits litigation of claims where TWIA accepted coverage. Id. at *1, 6. This 
Court rejected TWIA’s jurisdictional argument because the statute “do[es] not state 
that a trial court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over a claim raised against TWIA 
outside of the purview of the statute, nor do[es it] imply that a trial court lacks 
subject matter jurisdiction over a claim properly raised under the statute but 
deficient on the merits.” Id. at *6. The statutory limitation of liability, this Court 
held, “concerns only immunity from liability, which does not implicate subject 
matter jurisdiction.” Id. If an exclusive remedies provision that calls for an extra-
judicial process and remedy does not implicate subject matter jurisdiction in the 
absence of express language, it logically follows that neither does the MDL-
appointment provision.

court still had jurisdiction and should retain the case because it was a district court 
with general jurisdiction. Id. at 818. This Court disagreed, noting that the MDL 
procedure was specially created by the Legislature to manage the pretrial process 
in related cases involving common questions of fact, and that once the silica-
related claims were dropped, the case was no longer subject to the MDL court’s 
special jurisdiction. Id. at 818-21. The Court explained that “although the 333rd 
District Court is a court of general jurisdiction by virtue of the statutes that created 
it, when the 333rd District Court is acting pursuant to the MDL panel’s designation 
as a pretrial court under MDL rules and legislation, by reference to those rules, it is 
not a court of general jurisdiction.” Id. at 821.  
The Panel Opinion suggests, based on language in Champion Indus., that the 
117th District Court was not a court of general jurisdiction here because Pruski’s 
claim against TWIA is statutory. See Op. at 10 (emphasizing that district courts are 
not presumed to have jurisdiction over claims “grounded in statute rather than 
common law”). That is unsupported. First, no Texas court has ever held that 
district courts cease to be courts of general jurisdiction when a statutory cause of 
action is asserted, and that is all that is involved here: Pruski filed a lawsuit against 
TWIA in the 117th District Court asserting a statutory claim against TWIA. CR 1.

such limitation is involved here. Park, 2019 WL 1831771, at *6. In fact, the statute 
required Pruski to file his case in a district court in Nueces County because that is 
where the insured property is located. See TEX. INS. CODE § 2210.575(e) (suit must 
be filed “in a district court in the county in which the loss that is the subject of the

impose jurisdictional limitations, there is no such limitation here.

No evidence supports the conclusion that Judge Watts was not qualified or

Watts lacked “judicial authority,” and that her judgment is therefore “void,” 
because she was not appointed by the MDL Panel. See Op. at 10-13. In other

Second, the adverse effects of the Panel’s ruling could be far-reaching. The 
Panel held that no judge has authority to preside over a case involving TWIA 
unless that judge was appointed by the MDL Panel, and any rulings or judgments 
issued by any other judge are void. Op. at 12-13. The statute on which the Panel’s 
holding is based went into effect on September 28, 2011. Since then, over six 
hundred cases have been litigated under the statute, and several appeals have been 
decided,5 and in none of them was the trial judge appointed by the MDL Panel. 
The trial judge in each case was simply assigned in the usual course. Under the 
Panel’s Opinion, every ruling and judgment in those cases is now null and void and 
may be subject to collateral attack. 
Moreover, dozens of other TWIA cases are currently pending, and those 
cases have been thrown into disarray by the Panel’s Opinion. Because the 
presiding judges in those cases (with the exception of the Hurricane Harvey MDL 
pretrial judge) were not appointed by the MDL Panel but were assigned in the 
usual course, the courts’ judicial authority in all of those cases is now in doubt, and

Second, the adverse effects of the Panel’s ruling could be far-reaching. The
Panel held that no judge has authority to preside over a case involving TWIA
unless that judge was appointed by the MDL Panel, and any rulings or judgments
issued by any other judge are void. Op. at 12-13. The statute on which the Panel’s
holding is based went into effect on September 28, 2011. Since then, over six
hundred cases have been litigated under the statute, and several appeals have been
decided, and in none of them was the trial judge appointed by the MDL Panel.
The trial judge in each case was simply assigned in the usual course. Under the
Panel’s Opinion, every ruling and judgment in those cases is now null and void and
may be subject to collateral attack.

Moreover, dozens of other TWIA cases are currently pending, and those
cases have been thrown into disarray by the Panel’s Opinion. Because the
presiding judges in those cases (with the exception of the Hurricane Harvey MDL
pretrial judge) were not appointed by the MDL Panel but were assigned in the

usual course, the courts’ judicial authority in all of those cases is now in doubt, and

Pro se appellant Stephen Pruski sued appellee Texas Windstorm Insurance 
Association (TWIA) complaining that appellee “improperly denied portions of [his] claim 
for damages from Hurricane Harvey.” See TEX. INS. CODE ANN. §§ 2210.001–.705. TWIA 
filed a traditional motion for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. By four 
issues, Pruski argues that the trial court (1) “failed to meet requirements of [the] statute 
for [a] presiding judge,” (2) denied Pruski “reasonable access to all information relevant” 
to the case, (3) improperly excluded Pruski’s “evidentiary filings in opposition to statutory 
language,” and (4) abused its discretion in granting TWIA’s motion for summary judgment. 
We reverse and remand.

BACKGROUND 
Pruski’s condominium was damaged when Hurricane Harvey struck Corpus Christi 
in August 2017. Pruski’s property was insured under a hail and windstorm policy with 
TWIA, and Pruski filed a claim with TWIA under the policy on August 28, 2017. Following 
another rainstorm which purportedly caused damage to recently repaired areas, Pruski 
filed an additional claim with TWIA on December 12, 2017. TWIA issued its notice 
accepting coverage in part for both claims. However, TWIA declined coverage for the 
reported damages to the drywall on the perimeter walls and ceilings. Pruski served TWIA 
with a timely notice of intent to sue and subsequently filed suit, seeking recovery for the 
damages denied by TWIA. See id. § 2210.575(a).

Pruski’s condominium was damaged when Hurricane Harvey struck Corpus Christi
in August 2017. Pruski’s property was insured under a hail and windstorm policy with
TWIA, and Pruski filed a claim with TWIA under the policy on August 28, 2017. Following

damages denied by TWIA. See id. § 2210.575(a).

Pruski thereafter filed a motion for traditional summary judgment, which the trial
court denied. Pruski then filed a motion for recusal, questioning the judge’s impartiality

under Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 18b. Pruski’s motion additionally cited to

§ 2210.575(e) of the Texas Insurance Code as the “statute that is the genesis of this 
motion.”2 See id. § 2210.575(e) (setting forth requirements for the appointment of a judge 
over TWIA Act suits). A judge assigned by the regional administrative judge to consider 
Pruski’s motion denied the motion. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 18a(g). 
On March 10, 2021, TWIA filed a traditional summary judgment motion, arguing 
that “[a]s a matter of law, no coverage is owed” because Pruski’s “insurance policy only 
covers personal property and certain personal property that becomes affixed to his 
condominium”—which does not include drywall composing perimeter walls. The trial court 
granted TWIA’s motion for summary judgment and ordered that Pruski recover nothing 
from TWIA. This appeal followed. 
II. 
DISCUSSION 
By his first issue, which we find dispositive, see TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1, Pruski 
challenges the presiding judge’s authority to preside over this TWIA suit because the 
judge was never appointed by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (MDL Panel) in 
accordance with § 2210.575(e) of the insurance code. See TEX. INS. CODE ANN. 
§ 2210.575(e). This is an issue of first impression and one which requires us to analyze 
the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association Act (the TWIA Act) to determine whether 
§ 2210.575(e) imposes a judicial exclusivity. See TEX. INS. CODE ANN. §§ 2210.001–.705; 
see also TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. §§ 74.161–.164 (Court Administration Act, Subchapter H, 
“Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation”); see generally In re Tex. Windstorm Ins. Ass’n. 
 
2 TWIA acknowledges in its brief that “[t]he real substance of Pruski’s motion to recuse was that 
the presiding judge should have been appointed by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ([MDL 
Panel]), as contemplated in [§ 2210.]575(e) of the TWIA Act.” See TEX. INS. CODE ANN. § 2210.575(e).

judge appointed by the [MDL Panel] designated under [§] 74.161, Government Code.”3 
TEX. INS. CODE ANN. § 2210.575(e). 
The MDL Panel consists of five members designated by the Texas Supreme Court, 
and all actions by the MDL Panel require a concurrence from three of the five members. 
TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 74.161(a), (b). The MDL Panel operates in accordance with the 
rules of practice and procedures adopted by the supreme court. Id. § 74.163(a); see 
generally TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 74.021 (“The supreme court has supervisory and 
administrative control over the judicial branch and is responsible for the orderly and 
efficient administration of justice.”). One such rule—Rule of Judicial Administration 13—
was promulgated by the Texas Supreme Court in 2003, codified, and imposes a judicial 
exclusivity where applicable. TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. §§ 74.024, 74.163(b); see TEX. R. 
JUD. ADMIN. 13.1(a), (b)(1); cf. TEX. CONST. art. V, § 11 (“[T]he District Judges may 
exchange districts, or hold courts for each other when they may deem it expedient, and 
shall do so when required by law.”); TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 74.094(a); TEX. R. CIV. P. 
330(h). Rule 13 sets forth the procedures necessary for the MDL Panel “to transfer 
‘related’ cases (i.e.[,] cases involving common questions of fact) from different trial courts

In our determination of whether to depart from the ubiquitous meaning of “shall”—
specifically, to decide whether the Legislature’s use of “shall” constituted a conferment of 
exclusive judicial authority—we are confronted with a glaring omission in the statute: 
Section 2210.575 contains no guidance regarding the procedure necessary to initiate 
MDL Panel assignment. See generally TEX. INS. CODE ANN. § 2210.575 (setting forth a 
claimant’s notice requirements, establishing TWIA’s right to seek alternative dispute 
resolution, and requiring a court to abate “an action against [TWIA] . . . until the notice of 
intent to bring an action has been provided and, if requested by the association, the 
dispute has been submitted to alternative dispute resolution, in accordance with this 
section”). In contrast to Rule 13.3 proceedings, which places the onus on a party or court 
to request MDL Panel-intervention before appointment is considered and ordered, 
§ 2210.575 contains no such triggering provision. Compare TEX. R. JUD. ADMIN. 13.3 with 
TEX. INS. CODE ANN. § 2210.575(e). Section 2210.575(e) simply appears to necessitate—
without instruction as to how it is to be effectuated or by whom—that the MDL Panel must 
appoint a judge in TWIA Act filings. See TEX. INS. CODE ANN. § 2210.575(e); In re Tex. 
Windstorm Ins. Ass’n. Harvey Litig., No. 19-0472, at *1 (concluding that a “plain reading” 
of § 2210.575 requires that the MDL Panel appoint a judge in TWIA Act proceedings and 
explicitly “forecloses the assignment” of judges otherwise authorized to preside under 
Rule 13.6(a)). It is in partial consideration of this statutory silence that TWIA advances its 
interpretation of the provision as one akin to a venue challenge—i.e., waived if not timely 
asserted and otherwise unobstructive on a court’s authority to preside over a cause or 
render judgment.

the statute’s assignment requirement, we reject TWIA’s contention that Pruski’s failure to 
timely file a request for appointment constituted a waiver of his complaint. 
Having concluded such provision is mandatory and restrictive of a judge’s authority 
to preside over TWIA Act suits, we must also conclude the presiding judge was without 
authority to render judgment in this cause. See generally Dubai Petroleum Co. v. Kazi, 
12 S.W.3d 71, 74–75 (Tex. 2000) (“A judgment may properly be rendered against a party 
only if the court has authority to adjudicate the type of controversy involved in the action.”) 
(cleaned up). The judgment is therefore void. See In re D.S., 602 S.W.3d at 512 (“A 
judgment is void, rather than voidable, when it is apparent that the court rendering 
judgment had no jurisdiction over the parties or property, no jurisdiction over the subject 
matter, no jurisdiction to enter the particular judgment, or no capacity to act.”) (cleaned

We reverse the trial court’s judgment and remand with instructions to vacate and 
set aside the judgment and to conduct further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 
See TEX. R. APP. P. 43.2(d); see, e.g., San Patricio County v. Nueces County, 492 S.W.3d 
476, 488 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi–Edinburg 2016, pet. denied) (reversing “the 
judgment of the trial court rendered on the merits of the case” and remanding “with 
instructions to vacate and set aside that judgment and to transfer the case” to the 
appropriate county).

the statute’s assignment requirement, we reject TWIA’s contention that Pruski’s failure to
timely file a request for appointment constituted a waiver of his complaint.

Having concluded such provision is mandatory and restrictive of a judge’s authority
to preside over TWIA Act suits, we must also conclude the presiding judge was without
authority to render judgment in this cause. See generally Dubai Petroleum Co. v. Kazi,
12 S.W.3d 71, 74-75 (Tex. 2000) (“A judgment may properly be rendered against a party
only if the court has authority to adjudicate the type of controversy involved in the action.”)
(cleaned up). The judgment is therefore void. See /n re D.S., 602 S.W.3d at 512 (“A
judgment is void, rather than voidable, when it is apparent that the court rendering
judgment had no jurisdiction over the parties or property, no jurisdiction over the subject
matter, no jurisdiction to enter the particular judgment, or no capacity to act.”) (cleaned
up); cf. Comm'n for Law. Discipline v. Schaefer, 364 S.W.3d 831, 836 (Tex. 2012) (per
curiam) (“[JJudgments of disqualified trial judges are void.”). We sustain Pruski’s first
issue.

lll. CONCLUSION

We reverse the trial court’s judgment and remand with instructions to vacate and
set aside the judgment and to conduct further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
See TEX. R. APP. P. 43.2(d); see, e.g., San Patricio County v. Nueces County, 492 S.W.3d
476, 488 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi-Edinburg 2016, pet. denied) (reversing “the
judgment of the trial court rendered on the merits of the case” and remanding “with
instructions to vacate and set aside that judgment and to transfer the case” to the

appropriate county).
