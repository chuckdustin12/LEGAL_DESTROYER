I. INTRODUCTION
Relator intends to invoke this Court’s original jurisdiction in three 
closely related mandamus proceedings arising from overlapping family law 
cases in Tarrant County. The three issues central to this dispute involve 
facially void temporary orders, the refusal to hear an emergency TRO, and 
the granting of the opposing party’s consolidation motion sua sponte in the 
face of an objection.  All three matters are legally and procedurally 
interdependent yet hinge on each-other to effectuate resolution. To provide 
context, the three mandamus matters are: 
1. No. 02-25-00164-CV (“TRO Mandamus”)
Issue Presented: Whether the 233rd District Court erred in refusing to 
adjudicate an emergency request for temporary relief in a SAPCR 
properly filed before it on March 28, 2025. 
Procedural Posture: Denied per curiam on April 11, 2025; rehearing 
Brief Posture: The TRO mandamus proceeding raises core legal issues 
concerning a trial court’s ministerial duty to rule on properly filed 
motions, the abuse of discretion in refusing to hear an emergency TRO 
based on a future, unfiled consolidation motion, and the denial of due 
process by refusing to rule on the matter before it. 
2. No. 02-25-00166-CV (“Void-Order Mandamus”)
Issue Presented: Whether temporary orders issued by the 322nd District 
Court on March 14, 2024, are void ab initio for want of consent. (MR 
17.1) 
Procedural Posture: Pending decision before this Court.

Relator intends to invoke this Court’s original jurisdiction in three
closely related mandamus proceedings arising from overlapping family law
cases in Tarrant County. The three issues central to this dispute involve
facially void temporary orders, the refusal to hear an emergency TRO, and
the granting of the opposing party’s consolidation motion sua sponte in the
face of an objection. All three matters are legally and procedurally
interdependent yet hinge on each-other to effectuate resolution. To provide

context, the three mandamus matters are:

1. No. 02-25-00164-CV (“TRO Mandamus’’)

Issue Presented: Whether the 233rd District Court erred in refusing to
adjudicate an emergency request for temporary relief ina SAPCR
properly filed before it on March 28, 2025.

Procedural Posture: Denied per curiam on April 11, 2025; rehearing

Brief Posture: The TRO mandamus proceeding raises core legal issues
concerning a trial court’s ministerial duty to rule on properly filed
motions, the abuse of discretion in refusing to hear an emergency TRO
based on a future, unfiled consolidation motion, and the denial of due
process by refusing to rule on the matter before it.

2. No. 02-25-00166-CV (“Void-Order Mandamus’’)
Issue Presented: Whether temporary orders issued by the 322nd District
Court on March 14, 2024, are void ab initio for want of consent. (MR

Brief Posture: Showcases a total breakdown of procedure between 
January 16th, 2024’s “kick-out” order (MR 6.1) and March 14th, 2024’s 
one-sided consent judgement. (MR. 17.38) 
3. Forthcoming Petition – To Be Filed By April 16, 2025 (“Consolidation
Mandamus”)
Issue Presented: Whether the sua sponte granting of Real Party’s 
consolidation motion without addressing the objection, notice, or holding 
a hearing caused further prejudice to the Relator.
Relief Anticipated: A writ of mandamus vacating the consolidation 
order on grounds that it was entered without notice, without hearing, and 
in the face of Relator’s standing objection to consolidate, and a pending 
rule 12 motion. 
II. BACKGROUND SUMMARY
Between December 14, 2023, and December 22, 2023, Real Party in 
Interest, Morgan Myers, attempted to get an emergency ex-parte order of 
protection from the court below (MR 2.7), initiated an eviction proceeding 
(MR 19.15), converted $1,576 of joint-marital assets to a family member on 
her way to receive help in preparing divorce paperwork (MR 19.14), initiated 
a protective order suit, (MR  19.15), and filed for divorce claiming that an 
active order of protection existed against the undersigned. (MR 2.7) 
This frenzy of frivolous lawsuits was designed to acquire an advantage 
in the divorce proceedings, which ultimately succeeded on January 16, 2024.

(MR 6.1). Spinning a narrative of the need for protection, Real Party leveraged 
this initial award to her advantage and was able to delay the proceedings 
further on January 22 by acquiring her legal representative three minutes prior 
to the hearing. (MR 7), eventually leading to settlement and a non-suit of her 
allegations (MR 8.3), which became the orders of the court on March 14, 
2024, and were rendered as an agreement without Mr. Myers’ consent. (MR. 
17.38) The remainder of the litigation amounted to a one-sided effort by the 
undersigned to seek relief while the opposing party sat in silence and 
abandoned their case. (MR 1) 
After eleven months of silence, the Real Party became active again 
only after the SAPCR was opened by Mr. Myers, who was prevented from 
presenting his emergency TRO at the 11th hour, resulting in no order, and 
the emergency still ongoing.
Shortly 
after 
the 
initial 
mandamus 
was 
filed on April 10, 
2025, the Honorable Kenneth Newell sua sponte consolidated the 
cases without notice by granting Real Party’s motion in the face of 
an objection, and without a hearing to discuss the pertinent issues. 
The undersigned is prepared to litigate these matters, and the necessity 
to stay these proceedings is essential to preserve the rights of the parties and 
prevent further irreparable harm from occurring in the interim.

III. NECESSITY FOR STAY
Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 52.10 Authorizes a Stay to 
Preserve the Status Quo. Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 52.10(b) 
empowers this Court to “stay the underlying proceedings pending mandamus 
review”. A stay is warranted here to “preserve important substantive and 
procedural rights from impairment or loss” which here, is exactly the 
situation calling for such a remedy.  
The procedural posture of this case combined by the lack of 
participation by the opposing side and lack of input from the courts below 
throughout presents a truly unique situation from a legal perspective.
IV. SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT
The 322nd and 233rd District Courts of Tarrant County, Texas, are 
locked in a jurisdictional impasse that must be resolved to protect the best 
interests of the children and restore procedural integrity. These matters can 
be concurrently resolved through stepwise legal analysis. The first and most 
critical question is whether the current temporary orders—issued as an 
agreed judgement without the consent of all parties—can stand (MR 17.1, 
MR 17.38).

IV.SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT

The 322nd and 233rd District Courts of Tarrant County, Texas, are
locked in a jurisdictional impasse that must be resolved to protect the best
interests of the children and restore procedural integrity. These matters can
be concurrently resolved through stepwise legal analysis. The first and most

agreed judgement without the consent of all parties—can stand (MR 17.1,

MR 17.38).

If those orders are deemed void, then the 322nd District Court cannot 
assert continuing, exclusive jurisdiction (CEJ) under the Texas Family Code, 
which requires a valid final order to attach. see Tex. Fam. Code §155.001. In 
that event, the SAPCR filed in the 233rd District Court by the undersigned 
should stand as a procedurally proper original suit, and mandamus should 
issue to administer a hearing regarding the emergency TRO refused on 
March 28, 2025, without producing any valid order to challenge. 
At that juncture, should the Real Party argue dominant jurisdiction, the 
court must weigh the well-recognized exceptions under Texas law, including 
bad faith, unjustified delay, and strategic pretext—all of which are clearly 
demonstrated and conclusively established in the mandamus record filed 
concurrently with this matter. 
V. ARGUMENT
A. An agreed judgement rendered without consent is void
The first point of issue in this matter is the facially void orders rendered
on March 14, 2024. an order cannot expressly claim all parties consent “as 
evidenced by the signatures below” (MR 17.1) and then be absent from the 
document. (MR 17.38)

This is clear and cut Texas precedent. “A valid consent judgment cannot 
be rendered by a court when consent of one of the parties thereto is wanting. 
It is not sufficient to support the judgment that a party's consent thereto may 
at one time have been given; consent must exist at the very moment the court 
undertakes to make the agreement the judgment of the court.” Burnaman v. 
Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 (Tex. 1951) 
Here, the exact opposite occurred but our case takes it a step further. 
Mr. Myers was ordered to sign an agreement that he was in court that very 
same day to challenge. (MR 16.1) (“3. It is ordered that the parties shall 
present the temporary orders regarding the [associate judge’s report] signed 
on 02/01/2024 by 1:30 p.m. today.”)  
 
Moreover, the order explicitly refers to the Associate Judge’s Report 
signed on February 1, 2024, which could not have been possible because the 
attorney who was ordered to prepare the orders was no longer on the case. 
(MR 11) Therefore, the orders must be set aside, and mandamus should issue 
here. 
B. Continuous, exclusive jurisdiction 
Once the orders are declared void, we can then turn to the Texas Family 
Code § 155.001(a), which states “Specifically, except as otherwise provided

by this section, a court acquires continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the 
matters provided for by this title in connection with a child on the rendition of 
a final order.” Without the March 14 orders in place, which were a nullity from 
the start, the 322nd District Court does not retain continuous, exclusive 
jurisdiction as no other orders exist. Therefore, § 155.001(d) makes the 
SAPCR suit valid by statute, which leads us to an analysis of dominant 
jurisdiction. 
C. Doctrine of Dominant Jurisdiction
 Under Texas law, the doctrine of dominant jurisdiction provides that 
when two suits are pending in courts of concurrent jurisdiction involving the 
same parties and subject matter, the court in which the suit was first filed 
acquires dominant jurisdiction to the exclusion of the other court. This 
doctrine is established in the seminal case of Curtis v. Gibbs, 511 S.W.2d 263 
(Tex. 1974), where the Texas Supreme Court held that any subsequent suit 
involving the same parties and controversy must be dismissed if a party to that 
suit calls the second court's attention to the pendency of the prior suit. 
Normally, if the SAPCR matter were to try and set a matter for hearing, 
the Real Party could argue for dominant jurisdiction, as the divorce matter

was the “first filed” suit, and is pending before the 322nd District Court, and 
would have the suit transferred or abated. 
D. Bad Faith Exception
However, Texas courts recognize an important exception to the 
dominant jurisdiction doctrine: when the first-filed suit was brought in bad 
faith or for the purpose of delay. As established in Wyatt v. Shaw Plumbing 
Co., 760 S.W.2d 245, 248 (Tex. 1988), the first court's dominant jurisdiction 
can be defeated by showing that the first suit was filed:  
1. As a mere pretext to establish priority;
2. In anticipation of the second suit;
3. For the purpose of delay; or
4. In bad faith.
E. Three of four exceptions to dominant jurisdiction apply here
Here, three out of four of these exceptions apply. The suit was a mere 
pretext to establish priority, as Real Party went out of her way to file multiple 
frivolous lawsuits alleging family violence (MR 2.7, MR 3) only to then drop 
her claims after securing the children and home and abandon the case. (MR 
8.3)

The bad faith conducted by Real Party can be discerned by looking at 
the face of her pleadings themselves. On her original petition for divorce, on 
page 7, Real Party makes it known that she attempted to seek an emergency 
ex-parte order of protection on December 14, 2023. (MR 2.7) So the logical 
question to ask would be: why did Real Party need an emergency ex-parte 
order of protection if she already had an active order of protection? Better 
yet, why did mother seek a third protective order on December 22, 2023, if an 
active protective order was already in place? (MR 3) More importantly, why 
would she claim an active order of protection existed when she knew that 
wasn’t the case? (MR 2.7) This is a clear establishment of bad faith litigation, 
which also precluded her advantage by labeling the undersigned as an abuser 
prior to adjudication, satisfying two of four exceptions to dominant 
jurisdiction. 
Finally, after acquiring the children and home at the outset (MR. 6.1) 
and through the series of orders leading up to March 14, 2024, Real Party 
then abandoned her case and left the undersigned seeking relief throughout 
the Texas judiciary without opposition or participation. The only item found 
on the docket from the opposing side since then is a motion for pre-trial 
conference on April 24, 2024. (MR 1.7 DKT 206) In fact, it was only when

the undersigned opened the separate SAPCR that opposing counsel rushed in 
to defend it, leading to the concurrent mandamus filed under cause number 
No. 02-25-00164-CV currently at the rehearing stage. 
Therefore, because three of the four exceptions established in Wyatt 
apply here, the 322nd District Court of Tarrant county arguably would not 
retain dominant jurisdiction over the SAPCR suit filed by the undersigned to 
escape this procedural quagmire, and mandamus could issue there on 
rehearing so that they may lawfully proceed with the emergency TRO 
hearing which was turned away on March 28, 2025, which will lead to a 
situation that resembles what the legislature intends rather than the exact 
opposite. See Tex. Fam. Code 153.001. 
VI. Under the procedural posture of this case, a stay is not burdensome or
unduly prejudicial to the Real Party 
Given the unique and intertwined procedural posture of this matter, a 
stay is both appropriate and necessary to preserve the integrity of appellate 
review. Unlike Relator and the children—who continues to suffer irreparable 
harm under the force of void orders and were thrown into a chaotic 
arrangement —the Real Party in Interest faces no comparable prejudice from 
a stay. In fact, the Real Party has taken no meaningful action to prosecute their

the undersigned opened the separate SAPCR that opposing counsel rushed in
to defend it, leading to the concurrent mandamus filed under cause number
No. 02-25-00164-CV currently at the rehearing stage.

Therefore, because three of the four exceptions established in Wyatt
apply here, the 322™ District Court of Tarrant county arguably would not
retain dominant jurisdiction over the SAPCR suit filed by the undersigned to
escape this procedural quagmire, and mandamus could issue there on
rehearing so that they may lawfully proceed with the emergency TRO
hearing which was turned away on March 28, 2025, which will lead to a
situation that resembles what the legislature intends rather than the exact

opposite. See Tex. Fam. Code 153.001.

VI. Under the procedural posture of this case, a stay is not burdensome or
unduly prejudicial to the Real Party

Given the unique and intertwined procedural posture of this matter, a
stay is both appropriate and necessary to preserve the integrity of appellate
review. Unlike Relator and the children—who continues to suffer irreparable
harm under the force of void orders and were thrown into a chaotic
arrangement —the Real Party in Interest faces no comparable prejudice from

a stay. In fact, the Real Party has taken no meaningful action to prosecute their

claims and has allowed the case to stall for nearly a full calendar year. Any 
suggestion of prejudice is undermined by their own inaction. Relator, by 
contrast, has acted swiftly to correct procedural defects and vindicate his 
rights, and is fully prepared to brief this Honorable court regarding the matters 
at issue. 
VII. PRAYER
To the undersigned’s knowledge, no pro se litigant has ever been 
compelled to file three concurrent mandamus petitions addressing three 
separate structural irregularities involving two district courts in a single-
family law matter. This unprecedented procedural posture is not the result of 
litigation excess, but rather a response to a cascading breakdown of 
jurisdiction, due process, and court administration, which independently 
threatens the ability of this Honorable Court to grant meaningful relief. 
In fact, the only litigation that has occurred in this case has come from 
the undersigned. This litigation is not fueled by vindictiveness nor spite, but 
rather from the necessity to restore the status quo so that this divorce may 
proceed. The Relator holds the upmost respect for all three Judges named in 
this suit, and it is his prerogative to aid in the case’s forward-looking

WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Relator CHARLES 
DUSTIN MYERS respectfully prays that this Honorable Court: 
1. Grant an immediate emergency stay pursuant to Texas Rule of
Appellate Procedure 52.10(b), staying proceedings in the 322nd  District 
Court of Tarrant County, Texas—including but not limited to the March 14, 
2024 temporary orders—pending final disposition of the mandamus 
proceedings; 
2. Grant mandamus relief to preserve the status quo to protect the
best interests of the children, and to prevent further irreparable harm to 
Relator’s constitutional rights, business, and parent-child relationship; 
3. Permit Relator to file his third mandamus petition by April 16, 2025,
if the court deems necessary;
4. Grant such other and further relief, at law or in equity, to which
Relator may be justly entitled.

Statement of the Case

ARGUMENT 
A. Mandamus Standard
Mandamus relief is warranted when the trial court clearly abused its 
discretion, and the Relator (“Mr. Myers”), has no adequate appellate remedy. In re 
Coppola, 535 S.W.3d 506, 508 (Tex. 2017) (orig. proceeding) (per curiam). “A 
trial court clearly abuses its discretion if ‘it reaches a decision so arbitrary and 
unreasonable as to amount to a clear and prejudicial error of law' [or if it clearly 
fails] to analyze or apply the law correctly ․” Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 
839–40 (Tex. 2006) (orig. proceeding) (quoting Johnson v. Fourth Court of 
Appeals, 700 S.W.2d 916, 917 (Tex. 1985), disapproved of on other grounds by In 
re Columbia Med. Ctr. of Las Colinas, Subsidiary, L.P., 290 S.W.3d 204 (Tex. 
2009)). In any event, as shown in the next section, appeal is no remedy at all under 
these urgent circumstances. 
B. Consolidation and EX-Parte Procedure
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 174(a) permits consolidation of actions that 
involve common questions of law or fact. (APP 6.1) See also Lone Star Ford, Inc. v. 
McCormick, 838 S.W.2d 734, 737 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1992, writ 
denied). A trial court cannot arbitrarily consolidate cases in a manner that 
prejudices one of the parties. Even when consolidation is permissible in principle, 
the court must balance judicial convenience against any risk of unfair prejudice or

ARGUMENT

A. Mandamus Standard

Mandamus relief is warranted when the trial court clearly abused its
discretion, and the Relator (““Mr. Myers’’), has no adequate appellate remedy. In re
Coppola, 535 S.W.3d 506, 508 (Tex. 2017) (orig. proceeding) (per curiam). “A
trial court clearly abuses its discretion if ‘it reaches a decision so arbitrary and
unreasonable as to amount to a clear and prejudicial error of law' [or if it clearly
fails] to analyze or apply the law correctly .” Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833,
839-40 (Tex. 2006) (orig. proceeding) (quoting Johnson v. Fourth Court of
Appeals, 700 S.W.2d 916, 917 (Tex. 1985), disapproved of on other grounds by In
re Columbia Med. Ctr. of Las Colinas, Subsidiary, L.P., 290 S.W.3d 204 (Tex.
2009)). In any event, as shown in the next section, appeal is no remedy at all under
these urgent circumstances.

B. Consolidation and EX-Parte Procedure

Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 174(a) permits consolidation of actions that
involve common questions of law or fact. (APP 6.1) See also Lone Star Ford, Inc. v.
McCormick, 838 S.W.2d 734, 737 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1992, writ
denied). A trial court cannot arbitrarily consolidate cases in a manner that
prejudices one of the parties. Even when consolidation is permissible in principle,

the court must balance judicial convenience against any risk of unfair prejudice or

confusion, and it must respect the parties’ right to be heard on the issue. Crestway 
Care Ctr., Inc. v. Berchelmann, 945 S.W.2d 872, 874 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 
1997, orig. proceeding) (en banc). Consolidation decisions are reviewed for abuse 
of discretion, and “a trial court may abuse its discretion by … consolidating cases 
when the consolidation results in prejudice to the complaining party.” (citing Lone 
Star Ford, 838 S.W.2d at 738)  
In other words, when deciding whether to consolidate, the trial court must 
balance the judicial economy and convenience that may be gained by the 
consolidation against the risk of an unfair outcome because of prejudice. See Dal-
Briar, 833 S.W.2d at 615. Even if the cases share common questions of law and 
fact, an abuse of discretion may be found if the consolidation results in 
prejudice to the complaining party. Lone Star Ford, Inc., 838 S.W.2d at 738. 
Here, that is precisely what occurred. Mr. Myers has three concurrent 
mandamuses now before this court, and cause number 02-25-00164-CV, (“the 
TRO/SAPCR mandamus”) sought emergency relief in March 2025. (MR 8.2) The 
court’s procedural handling of his Application for Temporary Restraining Order 
(TRO) was highly irregular and violated the letter and spirit of Texas procedural 
rules.  
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 680 provides that no TRO shall be granted 
without notice to the adverse party unless specific facts show immediate

irreparable injury will occur before notice can be given. Even when an ex parte 
TRO is justified, TRCP 680 requires the order to be narrowly time-limited (14 
days) and promptly set for hearing on a temporary injunction. (APP 7) Here, Mr. 
Myers followed the rules by giving notice to the opposing party and coordinating 
with the Court for a presentation of his TRO. (MR 12.1-12.9) Tarrant County Local 
Rule 4.01(11)(e) (likewise requires a party seeking ex parte relief to certify to the 
Court the efforts made to notify the opposing side or explain why notice should not 
be given. Mr. Myers never received a response from the opposing side. 
Notably, on March 27, 2025, the Court (through its coordinator) insisted that 
Mr. Myers appear in person to present the TRO and inform opposing counsel of the 
scheduled time. The coordinator wrote:  
“This order needs to be presented in person. Likewise, you need to inform opposing 
counsel of the date and time you intend to present this order to the court.” (MR 12.9) 
Mr. Myers promptly complied. He emailed Ms. Allison on March 27 
confirming that he had informed the opposing counsel of the intended presentation 
at 9:00 a.m. the following day and that he would update both the Court and 
opposing party if anything changed. (MR 12.9) 
After receiving no response from either the opposing counsel or real party in 
interest, Mr. Myers served the documents he intended to present to the court. (MR

12.19) Rather than corresponding with Mr. Myers directly, the opposing counsel
contacted the court coordinator, where she stated via email:

 “I have received communication from opposing party who is pro se that he will be 
walking through an Emergency TRO. Our office has a hearing scheduled for tomorrow morning 
in Parker County and is unable to attend. However, I will be available by cell phone regarding 
this matter if the Judge would like to speak to me regarding the Emergency TRO. Please 
contact our office to patch me in for any calls that Judge would like to have.” (MR 12.20) 
and most critically, the opposing counsel went on to say: 
“Additionally, this case already is pending in the 322nd for a divorce proceeding 
regarding property and children matters. We will be consolidating the case and walking it 
through the 322nd for signature next week.” (MR 12.20) 
The following morning, Mr. Myers made an appearance, as confirmed by the 
coordinator.  
“Mr. Myers appeared before me to schedule the hearing for the TRO; my apologies I did 
not realize this was that same case.  We can go ahead and set the TRO with us, but most 
likely the case will be transferred prior to the hearing date and the case needs to be 
transferred prior to that date. Mr. Myers will be emailing with dates available for the 
hearing.” (MR 12.24) 
This was followed by the following email: 
“Additionally, since there is an objection to the consolidation, y’all will need to reach out 
to request how to proceed 
with the 322nd as I am usure of their procedures.” (MR 12.25) 
Mr. Myers then promptly provided dates at 9:59 a.m. on March 28, 2025, (MR  
12.26) the hearing was agreed to be set for April 10, 2025. (MR 12.29) Despite  
following the correct procedure, Mr. Myers was not permitted to present his 
emergency TRO, and was denied the opportunity to be heard outright because of 
the consolidation motion that would be filed the following week. (MR 12.20)

threshold matters should have came second to the best interests of the children. See 
Tex. Fam. Code 153.002. (APP 5) 
That statement – “I did not realize this was that same case” (MR 12.24)  – is a 
stunning acknowledgment of a procedural lapse. It indicates that the Court failed to 
connect the dots that Mr. Myers’ new case concerning the child was related to the 
ongoing divorce case. As a result, instead of promptly hearing Mr. Myers TRO on 
its merits, the Court stalled and immediately contemplated moving the case away, 
leaving Mr. Myers’ emergency request in limbo. The only individuals who 
followed proper procedure here were the undersigned and the court coordinator, 
non-licensed individuals. (MR 12.24)  
In summary, the procedure leading up to Respondent’s abuse of discretion 
was an abuse of discretion itself, warranting the “TRO/SAPCR Mandamus” that 
was denied per curiam without any substance. (APP 4) 
It was made very clear by the 233rd court that the consolidation motion filed 
by the opposing party on March 20, 2025, was filed in the incorrect court. (MR 5) 
(MR 12.17) This was used against Mr. Myers at the 11th hour to prevent the TRO

Shortly thereafter, the opposing counsel emailed Mr. Myers stating: 
“This is to inform you that I will be walking through the attached Motion for 
Consolidation and Proposed Order tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m. in the 322nd for 
signature.” (MR 12.31) 
Mr. Myers promptly replied, stating: 
“I've already objected. 
You have no legal authority to do so until you address my objection filed and 
served to you.” (MR 12.32) 
This procedural gamesmanship is the exact reason why the undersigned opened a 
new SAPCR, as it has left the divorce to languish outside of one-sided attempts to 
pursue relief, as clearly pointed out in his pleadings. There has been no meaningful 
discussion on the merits of this matter with the opposing side and no attempt to 
prosecute outside of the latest stunt to block emergency relief. (MR 1.1) From 
there, Mr. Myers filed a NOTICE OF INTENT TO SEEK MANDAMUS RELIEF

submitted to this court on April 10, 2024.

C. ABUSE OF DISCRETION
Immediately after submitting his first mandamus petition, Mr. Myers was 
served with an ORDER GRANTING CONSOLIDATION. (MR 15) This motion, 
which was used as a barrier to relief, was granted sua sponte by the same court 
who just declined to hear an emergency TRO before it. 
The record leaves no doubt that Respondent’s decision to consolidate the 
cases without notice or a hearing was a gross departure from the fair administration 
of justice. It is difficult to imagine a more textbook abuse of discretion: a contested 
motion was granted sua sponte, with no opportunity for the opposing party to be 
heard. This is not a close call or a minor procedural wrinkle. The facts speak for 
themselves – equity, due process, and basic procedural fairness were all denied in 
one fell swoop. The only question is whether they will continue to be ignored. 
Texas courts have held that a trial court clearly abuses its discretion by 
granting a contested motion sua sponte without providing notice or a hearing. In 
D.A. Buckner Constr., Inc. v. Hobson, for example, the trial judge entered an order
(imposing sanctions) even though the affected party had no notice or opportunity to 
be heard. The court of appeals declared that order void and emphatically stated: 
“Respondent’s order was without notice or hearing. Under these circumstances, the 
trial court’s order is void, and mandamus will lie to vacate such an order.” Such is 
the case here. Therefore, the law should apply equally.

D. NO ADEQUATE REMEDY 
In determining whether an appeal is an adequate remedy, courts have 
weighed the benefits over the detriments. In re BP Prods. N. Am., Inc., 244 S.W.3d 
840, 845 (Tex.2008) (orig.proceeding).  A party establishes that no adequate 
appellate remedy exists by showing it is in real danger of losing its substantial 
rights. Perry v. Del Rio, 66 S.W.3d 239, 257 (Tex.2001) (orig.proceeding). As 
repeatedly stated throughout these proceedings, Relator has been deprived of the 
most fundamental rights one can have: the right to possess and protect his home, 
and the right to care for, maintain contact with, and make decisions regarding his 
minor children. These rights are not abstract — they are protected by the U.S. 
Constitution, the Texas Constitution, and longstanding precedent. 
E. ONGOING AND IRREPARABLE HARM 
The Texas Supreme Court has repeatedly reaffirmed that “a parent’s rights to 
the care, custody, and control of their children are constitutional in nature and must 
be afforded heightened protection.” In re C.J.C., 603 S.W.3d 804, 809 (Tex. 2020). 
Likewise, property rights — including the right to remain in and possess one’s 
home — are protected under Article I, Section 19 of the Texas Constitution and the 
Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. See also University of Tex. Med. 
Branch v. Than, 901 S.W.2d 926, 930 (Tex. 1995)

When such rights are denied without valid order, hearing, or opportunity to 
be heard — as occurred here — the violation is not merely procedural: it is a 
constitutional injury, and one that warrants immediate mandamus relief. For all 
reasons incorporated herein, Mandamus should be issued, as deprivation is 
ongoing, and will occur until justice is rightfully served. 
Relator has clearly established the Respondent’s consolidation was both 
procedurally improper, and prejudicial. For all reasons incorporated herein, the 
court should uphold Texas precedent, and issue mandamus relief to restore justice 
to these proceedings. 
CONCLUSION 
With a prima facie showing of systemic abuse laid bare across the trilogy of 
mandamus petitions now before this Court, it is no longer credible to characterize 
the lower court’s conduct as isolated error. Two of the three heads of this 
procedural dragon—embodied by the 233rd, the 322nd, and this very Court—have 
already rendered per curiam denials, offering no explanation in the face of 
documented, unrebutted misconduct. The record in each petition stands 
unopposed. No adversary response has been filed. No evidentiary challenge has 
been made. The silence against Relator’s claims is not merely strategic—it is 
telling. A dangerous precedent is being forged in silence. This court must act.

PRAYER 
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Relator CHARLES DUSTIN 
MYERS respectfully prays that this Honorable Court: 
1. Issue a writ of mandamus compelling the Hon. Kenneth Newell, Judge of
the 233rd District Court, to vacate the April 2025 consolidation order, as it
was entered sua sponte on a contested motion;
2. Take judicial notice of the procedural irregularities and record-supported
adversity faced by Relator throughout these proceedings, including the
refusal to hear his emergency TRO while simultaneously granting relief to
the opposing party;
3. Grant all other relief to which Relator may be justly entitled, at law or in
equity, in light of the extraordinary circumstances and ongoing deprivation
of due process.
Relator has before this Court three petitions for writ of mandamus. Two have
already been denied per curiam without explanation—perhaps the result of routine 
disregard for pro se filings. But on rehearing, this Court is urged to evaluate this 
petition in conjunction with its sister mandamuses to fully grasp the depth of 
systemic abuse, procedural evasion, and judicial inconsistency present in the courts 
below.
