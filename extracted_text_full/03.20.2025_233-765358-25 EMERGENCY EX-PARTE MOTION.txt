IN THE 233RD DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THE 233rd DISTRICT COURT: 
1. For the preceding twelve months and fourteen days, Petitioner has been unlawfully
Barred from entering his residence and has been cut out of his children’s lives. On March 6th,  
2024, while walking M.E.M and C.R.M. to school, Respondent unlawfully locked the Petitioner 
out of the matrimonial home and called the Watauga police department who came to assist in the 
dispute. When on scene at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148, Respondent produced an 
agreed associate judge’s report where consent had been withdrawn and used it as a means to bar 
the Petitioner’s entry to the home. With an emergency hearing date set for March 14th, 2024, the 
Petitioner took the advice of the officers and stayed with his father temporarily in Flower 
Mound, Texas to avoid unnecessary conflict.  
2. On March 14th, 2024, the Petitioner appeared in person and was served a reduced copy
of the orders he was in court to challenge and from which he withdrew his consent from. Despite

TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THE 233" DISTRICT COURT:

1. For the preceding twelve months and fourteen days, Petitioner has been unlawfully
Barred from entering his residence and has been cut out of his children’s lives. On March 6",
2024, while walking M.E.M and C.R.M. to school, Respondent unlawfully locked the Petitioner
out of the matrimonial home and called the Watauga police department who came to assist in the
dispute. When on scene at ee, Respondent produced an
agreed associate judge’s report where consent had been withdrawn and used it as a means to bar
the Petitioner’s entry to the home. With an emergency hearing date set for March 14", 2024, the
Petitioner took the advice of the officers and stayed with his father temporarily in Flower
Mound, Texas to avoid unnecessary conflict.

2. On March 14", 2024, the Petitioner appeared in person and was served a reduced copy

of the orders he was in court to challenge and from which he withdrew his consent from. Despite

this, the orders were rendered anyway, effectively barring the Petitioner from his own home and 
Children’s lives despite his consent not being present at the time of rendition.  
 
3. The orders in question, attached hereto as EXHIBIT 1, are facially void and lack legal 
effect. Despite this, they continue to cause ongoing and irreparable harm, as further detailed 
below. Accordingly, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court issue a declaratory judgment 
formally recognizing the invalidity of these orders which will simultaneously provide long-
overdue relief to the children in this matter. In support of this request, the Petitioner shows as 
follows: 
I. STATEMENT OF FACTS 
 
4. On page 1 of the orders, they read as follows: “The parties have agreed to the terms of 
this order as evidenced by the signatures below.” 
 
5. On the final page of the orders, the signatures of CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS and his 
previous attorney, DAN BACALIS, are not present on the document. 
 
6. The Petitioner refused to sign the orders to which he did not consent to on March 14th, 
2024. 
 
7. The orders were rendered on March 26th, 2024, as an agreement between the parties 
despite consent not being present at the time of rendition. 
 
8. The orders are void ab initio and have no legal effect. 
II. ARGUMENT 
A. An “Agreed” Order Without Actual Consent is Void Ab Initio 
9. Texas law is unequivocal that a judgment purporting to rest on an agreement of the 
parties cannot be rendered or enforced if one of the parties did not genuinely consent at the time 
of rendition. The consent of all parties at the time the court renders judgment is a prerequisite for

5. On the final page of the orders, the signatures of CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS and his
previous attorney, DAN BACALIS, are not present on the document.

6. The Petitioner refused to sign the orders to which he did not consent to on March 14",
2024.

parties cannot be rendered or enforced if one of the parties did not genuinely consent at the time

of rendition. The consent of all parties at the time the court renders judgment is a prerequisite for

a valid agreed order. As the Texas Supreme Court has stated, a trial court cannot render a valid 
agreed judgment absent the consent of the parties at the time it is rendered, and the 
agreement can be revoked at any time before judgment is rendered on the agreement.  S & A 
Restaurant Corp. v. Leal, 892 S.W.2d 855, 857 (Tex.1995). This is so because a trial court cannot 
render a valid agreed judgment absent the consent of the parties at the time it is rendered. Padilla 
v. LaFrance, 907 S.W.2d 454, 461 (Tex.1995).  
10. In S&A Restaurant Corp. v. Leal, the Court reaffirmed that a party may revoke 
consent to a settlement at any time before judgment is rendered, and if a court nonetheless signs 
a judgment after consent has been revoked, “a judgment rendered after one party revokes his 
consent is void.” This rule reflects a fundamental principle: true consent is the linchpin of any 
agreed order. 
11. Here, Petitioner never consented to the order at the time they were entered. Indeed, 
his missing signature is a prima facie showing of this fact. Under these circumstances, it was 
error for the Court to sign the order as an “agreed” judgment, and the result is that the order 
is void ab initio. The Texas Supreme Court’s decision in Quintero v. Jim Walter Homes, Inc., 654 
S.W.2d 442 (Tex. 1983) is directly on point. In Quintero, the Court held that when a trial court 
has knowledge that one party does not consent to a judgment, the court “should refuse to 
sanction [the] agreement by making it the judgment of the court.” Id. By entering an order in 
the absence of Petitioner’s consent, the agreed judgment in this case was not just voidable—it is 
absolutely void from inception. In legal effect, there never was a valid temporary order at all, 
because the requisite meeting of the minds was absent. 
12. Texas courts of appeals have applied these principles in situations analogous to 
Petitioner’s, particularly in family law cases. For example, in In re E.B., No. 12-17-00214-CV

(Tex. App.—Tyler Oct. 18, 2017), the trial court had entered temporary orders incorporating a 
Rule 11 settlement agreement regarding conservatorship and possession of children. The father, 
however, had timely revoked his consent to that agreement. The Tyler Court of Appeals held that 
because the father withdrew consent before judgment, the agreed terms regarding 
conservatorship and possession were void. The appellate court unequivocally stated that the 
provisions of the temporary orders involving the children “are void, and the trial court abused 
its discretion in entering temporary orders based on the [purported] Agreement.” The court 
conditionally granted mandamus and directed the trial judge to vacate those portions of the 
temporary order.  
B. A Void Judgment is a Nullity and Can Be Challenged or Vacated at Any Time 
13. Because the temporary orders were entered without jurisdiction (i.e. without consent 
jurisdiction conferred by the parties’ agreement), the resulting “agreed” order is void. Under 
Texas law, a void judgment or order has no legal force or effect from the outset. It is “null” ab 
initio, and any person or court affected by it is entitled to treat it as a nullity. The Texas Supreme 
Court has explained that a void order is, in effect, no order at all: “[A] void judgment is a legal 
nullity . . . .” Alanis v. Barclays Capital Real Estate Inc., No. 04-17-00069-CV (Tex. App. Mar. 
27, 2017).  
14. Such a judgment may be collaterally attacked and set aside at any time, as it is not 
subject to ordinary procedural bars. Browning v. Placke, 698 S.W.2d 362 (Tex. 1985) (per 
curiam), is instructive on this point. In Browning, the Supreme Court recognized that courts of 
equal jurisdiction have the authority to declare a judgment void when it suffers from a 
fundamental defect (such as lack of jurisdiction or lack of consent). Here, this is a direct fit with 
the present situation.

C. Respondent’s most recent attempt to subvert the process 
 
15. On March 20th, 2025, Respondent filed an original answer and motion to consolidate 
through COOPER L. CARTER, which was prepared by RODERICK MARX. These filings are a 
direct showing of the Respondent’s game. She remains silent for months, and then at the first 
sign of her false narrative being under attack, she unleashes her attorney to file pleadings using 
the EFM Credentials of another individual not named in the suit – Roderick Marx – to prevent 
the relief duly entitled to Petitioner. 
 
16. Petitioner reminds this court that Respondent’s answer is clearly a boilerplate 
response template that doesn’t even address the core issues raised in the SAPCR. The first lines 
of the Response claim that Respondent has no driver’s license or social security number, which 
shows the rushed nature of her pleading in an attempt to defend the Respondent’s false narrative 
she has procured through fraud. 
 
17. Petitioner also points out that the Respondent wants to consolidate this matter with 
the divorce matter that is procedurally defunct, which would not be in the best interests of the 
children because it would move the matter back to the procedurally stalled case that hasn’t bene 
prosecuted by the same attorney who is requesting consolidation. Such would defeat the entire 
purpose of this suit, and would cause undue delay and prejudice the children and Petitioner. 
D. Request for immediate re-entry. 
 
18. Given the orders in question are facially void, Petitioner requests an immediate notice 
to be filed and served on the parties of record so that he may return home to his children, 
residence, and place of business until this matter can be set for a hearing. Petitioner’s unlawful 
exclusion from his residence creates further harm to the children each day it is left unaddressed.

19. Petitioner reiterates that his immediate return is in line with Texas Public Policy, 
nobody has argued against his relief sought, and this court has the discretion to issue temporary 
orders and dispense without the necessity of a bond or verified pleading pursuant to TEX. FAM. 
CODE. 105.001.  
 
20. Preventing a father from accessing his home which is needed for financial stability 
will continue to cause monetary and emotional damage to the children until resolved. 
PRAYER FOR EXPEDITED RELIEF 
WHEREFORE, promises considered, Petitioner respectfully request of this court 
without delay: 
1. To declare the orders attached as Exhibit 1 void ab initio and issue findings 
permitting the Petitioner to return home to 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 
76148 immediately for the orders lacking consent of all parties at the time of 
rendition and for not bearing the Petitioner’s signature. 
2. To serve on all parties of record confirmation that the orders are without legal 
effect. 
3. Enforce the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and prevent Cooper L. Carter 
from representing the Respondent in this matter until she can conform to 
electronic filing requirements and strike her pleadings outright. 
4. Any further relief that the court deems just and equitable. 
5. Given the extraordinary circumstances, set this motion for hearing at the 
earliest possible time, to be conducted via zoom if possible for judicial 
efficiency given the Petitioner’s financial strain caused by this situation.
