NO. 233-765358-25 
IN THE 233RD DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THE 233RD DISTRICT COURT: 
COMES NOW, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, Petitioner pro se, and files this Rule 12 
Motion to Show Authority pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12, and respectfully shows 
the Court as follows: 
1. There is a general presumption that an attorney is acting with authority; however, that
presumption is rebuttable. Breceda v. Whi, 187 S.W.3d 148, 152 (Tex. App.--El Paso 2006, no 
pet.). If evidence or circumstances cast doubt on the attorney’s authority, the presumption gives 
way and the attorney must prove actual authority. For example, an attorney who conducted a trial 
is presumed authorized to pursue an appeal, but that presumption can be rebutted with contrary 
evidence. Here, the unusual facts surrounding Ms. Carter’s involvement thoroughly rebut any 
presumption of her authority to represent the Respondent named in this matter, Morgan Michelle 
Myers, as detailed below.

TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THE 23382 DISTRICT COURT:

COMES NOW, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, Petitioner pro se, and files this Rule 12
Motion to Show Authority pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12, and respectfully shows

the Court as follows:

1. There is a general presumption that an attorney is acting with authority; however, that
presumption is rebuttable. Breceda v. Whi, 187 S.W.3d 148, 152 (Tex. App.--El Paso 2006, no

way and the attorney must prove actual authority. For example, an attorney who conducted a trial
is presumed authorized to pursue an appeal, but that presumption can be rebutted with contrary
evidence. Here, the unusual facts surrounding Ms. Carter’s involvement thoroughly rebut any
presumption of her authority to represent the Respondent named in this matter, Morgan Michelle

Myers, as detailed below.

I. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12 – Attorney Must Show Authority
A. Carter’s Lack of Authority Indicia
2. A party in a suit or proceeding pending in a court of this state may, by sworn written
motion stating that he believes the suit or proceeding is being prosecuted or defended without 
authority, cause the attorney to be cited to appear before the court and show his authority to act. 
The notice of the motion shall be served upon the challenged attorney at least ten days before the 
hearing on the motion. At the hearing on the motion, the burden of proof shall be upon the 
challenged attorney to show sufficient authority to prosecute or defend the suit on behalf of the 
other party. Tex. R. Civ. P. 
3. Multiple red flags call into question whether Carter is authorized – or even genuinely
acting – as Ms. Myers’s counsel, justifying relief under Rule 12. Petitioner respectfully requests 
that the court requires RODERICK D. MARX and COOPER L. CARTER to appear and show 
their authority to represent MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS in this matter to clear up the 
ambiguity surrounding their representation. 
B. Pleadings Filed by Proxy
4. Every filing attributed to Carter in this case was filed through another attorney, Roderick
Marx, rather than by Carter herself. Mr. Marx is the founding partner of the MAJ firm Carter 
formerly worked for, and he submitted documents “on her behalf” through the electronic filing 
manager. In effect, Carter has not personally prosecuted or defended anything – someone else is 
handling the filings. This raises serious doubts about whether Carter is acting as counsel or whether 
Mrs. Myers’s case is being carried (or neglected) by others without a clear designation. An attorney 
of record should be the one signing filings or at least directly supervising and endorsing them; if

not, the court and opposing party cannot even be sure the attorney whose name is on the pleadings 
is truly involved. Such proxy filings strongly indicate that Carter may lack authority or engagement 
– if she had authority, one would expect her direct participation. Rule 12 is meant to prevent exactly
this sort of scenario where a suit might be conducted by someone without clear authorization. 
C. Employment/Firm Misrepresentation
5. Carter’s own public statements conflict with the representations made to the court about
her role. While her pleadings continued to identify her as “Cooper Carter, Marx Altman & 
Johnson” (with a MAJ email address), her initial response in the instant case was filed by Roderick 
D Marx, signed by Cooper Carter with the Marx, Altman & Johnson letterhead, and then claimed 
that Cooper L. Carter was retained in her individual capacity. Further: 
i. Carter’s public Facebook profile claims that she is no longer employed with Marx,
Altman, & Johnson. 
ii. Carter’s public LinkedIn profile claims that she is no longer employed with Marx,
Altman, & Johnson, and that she currently is employed at Cantey and Hanger, LLP. 
iii. Carter’s Electronic Filing Manager is registered under ccarter@canteyhangar.com.
This level of ambiguity is unnecessary and could be deliberate. In fact, Texas law requires attorneys 
to keep their State Bar profile updated with current employment information (Tex. Gov’t Code 
§ 81.115), which currently reflects her employment with Marx, Altman & Johnson.  So the
question remains: why would Carter update her Texas State Bar profile to reflect her current 
employer but leave her social media and LinkedIn outdated?

6. Carter’s complete failure to prosecute the divorce case for an extended period also
undercuts any claim of active authority. An attorney who is truly acting with a client’s authorization 
is expected to pursue the client’s interests diligently – e.g. respond to motions, appear at hearings, 
move the case forward. Carter, however, has been conspicuously silent. She has not plead any 
defense for her client, has not participated in any discovery.  
7. Carter’s abrupt appearance in this suit—after months of silence in the divorce case—
mirrors the same confusion and procedural uncertainty that plagued the divorce action. This re-
emergence appears tactical, not substantive, and should not obstruct the SAPCR’s merits-based 
progression. She has not mentioned anything about the children, their status, or how the current 
situation is what’s best for them.  
8. Carter’s only notable action in the last six months related to her client has been to seek
consolidation of the SAPCR with the dormant divorce – essentially tethering the active custody 
matter to a paralyzed divorce case which would further prejudice the children and delay the relief 
sought. 
II. Conflicts of Interest and Duty of Candor
9. Misrepresenting one’s role or affiliation can also create conflicts of interest and
breaches of the duty of candor. If an attorney signs pleadings stating it was “necessary to retain 
their legal services” while filing under a firm’s name, it muddles who was retained – the individual 
lawyer or the firm. This ambiguity can prejudice the client’s interests and the opposing party’s 
understanding of the representation. 
10. For example, in the case at hand the answer explicitly stated, “It was necessary for
Morgan [Michelle] Myers to secure the services of COOPER L. CARTER, a licensed attorney, to

prepare and defend this suit.”.  Yet, the filing was styled as coming from “Marx Altman & 
Johnson” with Carter as the attorney. If Mrs. Carter was operating as a solo practitioner at that 
point, the pleading arguably misled the court about who had been hired. This kind of 
misrepresentation may violate the lawyer’s candor toward the tribunal (e.g. Tex. Disc. R. 3.03 
or its equivalents) since it obscures a material fact – the lawyer’s true status. Courts have held that 
lawyers must not omit facts necessary to keep statements from being misleading. Failing to clarify 
that the attorney is no longer with the named firm, it could be seen as an omission that makes the 
filing as a whole misleading. 
III. Unauthorized Filings and “Ghost” Representation
12. Having documents filed by another attorney who has not formally appeared is another
problematic practice. In proper procedure, every pleading or motion must be signed by an 
attorney of record – i.e. a lawyer who has made an appearance in the case. Texas is clear: “Every 
pleading of a party represented by an attorney shall be signed by at least one attorney of record 
in his individual name.” If Attorney A is counsel of record, it is improper for Attorney B (who 
has not appeared in the case) to file documents on A’s behalf without disclosure or court 
permission.  
13. In the example above, the e-filing system’s certificate shows “Roderick Marx on
behalf of Cooper Carter” as the filer, neither of which have formally appeared. This kind of 
“ghost filing” blurs who is responsible for the document. Courts frown upon undisclosed 
involvement of attorneys because it can circumvent accountability and confuse the record. At 
best, it is an irregular practice; at worst, it could be seen as misrepresentation to the court. Here, 
given the same circumstances exist in the divorce case which has been abandoned, Petitioner 
believes the situation leans more towards misrepresentation.
