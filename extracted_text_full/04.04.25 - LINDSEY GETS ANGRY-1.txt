Hello,
Thanks for the update.
However, it would be procedurally improper to set a matter for hearing given noncompliance with 237a Tex. R. CIV. P by
Petitioner.
Also, the consolidation motion is moot as a crucial step in this process was not followed by opposing counsel.
The Texas Family Code requires a suit to be transferred prior to any consolidation taking place. No such transfer has
been filed, so any attempt at consolidation is improper before the prerequisite requirement is met pursuant to Tex. R. Civ.
P. 6.407(b), which is the statute i assume she is invoking here.
For these reasons, it would be more appropriate to set the matter for hearing on the DWOP filed and served back in
January given the lack of prosecution until now.
That way, no further unnecessary delays occur and the children get the unopposed relief they've been needing.
Thank you,
Charles Dustin Myers

Lindsey,
I'm unsure if you've received my last email, but the transfer motion cannot just be skipped, and I had requested a hearing
for the DWOP prior to this improper request for a consolidation.
Please refer to Texas Family Code 6.407.
Not sure what purpose a hearing on the consolidation would serve granted it's premature and doesn't comport with Texas
Procedure other than to have it summarily denied as a matter of law, which also seems to defeat the need for a hearing.
I'm available at the court's earliest convenience for a hearing on the DWOP.
If the Court insists on a consolidation hearing despite it beind proceedurally premature, I would like to request we also
hear the pending DWOP concurrently in the interest of judicial economy.
Thank you,
Charles Dustin Myers

Ms. Baker,
While I understand your position and your duties as a coordinator, I must respectfully point out that the duty to promote
the efficient administration of justice is relevant here.
Setting a hearing to consolidate a case that the court doesn't have in its possession has the opposite effect of this and will
cause unnecessary delay due to jurisdictional issues.
