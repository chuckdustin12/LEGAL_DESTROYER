The First Amended Petition for Divorce presents yet another series of critical flaws and

Respondent has firmly denied the allegations herein in multiple documents within the 
court’s possession, including an answer to the Protective Order, alongside several 
Exhibits with supporting documentation. Particularly, the Counter Petition for divorce, 
which more accurately reflects the true nature of the best interests of our children and 
does not contain false information or inaccuracies aimed at gaining an unfair 
advantage, has yet to be considered.  
Based on the forthcoming inaccuracies, the false allegations, and the clear oversight 
by Counsel, the Respondent moves the Court to reset Cause No. 322-744263-23 which 
would immediately restore stability to the children’s lives, give all parties involved 
time for an appropriate conference, and to follow the court procedures properly, and

Charles Dustin Myers,

Respondent

To the Honorable Judge of said Court:

The First Amended Petition for Divorce presents yet another series of critical flaws and
misrepresentations, reflective of the pattern established in every document filed thus
far by the opposing Party.1

Respondent has firmly denied the allegations herein in multiple documents within the
court’s possession, including an answer to the Protective Order, alongside several
Exhibits with supporting documentation. Particularly, the Counter Petition for divorce,
which more accurately reflects the true nature of the best interests of our children and

INACCURACIES OF PETITION/DENIAL 
This section of this document will reference the corresponding numbered sections 
found in the First Amended Petition for Divorce. 
6. Dates of Marriage and Separation
1. December 1st, 2023, is not just inaccurate; it is a blatant
misrepresentation of our living situation. Our cohabitation, verified by 
multiple documents accepted by this Court, continued unabated, 
reflecting a conscientious effort to preserve normalcy for our daughters 
during an especially sensitive time. The date of separation came on 
January 16th, 2024 – without a hearing, which has been detrimental and 
the focal-point of these proceedings by the Petitioner. 
7. Grounds for Divorce
2. Petitioner claims the marriage became insupportable due to discord or
conflict of personalities. This is inaccurate. The divorce was announced 
without any prior attempt at counseling, communication, therapy, or any 
visible signs of marital discord around the holiday season.  
8. Children of the Marriage
3. The petition inaccurately asserts that no court-ordered
conservatorships, guardianships, or relationships affecting the children 
of this marriage were in place at the time of filing, which is another 
blatant inaccuracy and oversight. 
4. At the time of filing, orders were in place based on false claims from
the Petitioner, hindering my work and damaging the relationship with 
my children. Opposing counsel was appointed on or around January 
22nd, 2024, on last minute notice, which lead to a case continuance – 
which extended the Temporary Orders currently in place at that time to 
the reset date of February 1st, 2024.

6. The  request for the exclusive right to designate the primary residence 
of the children is detrimental, as the Petitioner is employed part-time 
and has no desire to acquire full time employment and has 
demonstrated a pattern of deception that has destabilized the children's 
lives and damaged my ability to provide for them, which directly 
impacts them. 
7. This oversight shows the consequences of not conducting proper 
discovery by opposing Counsel, and that this case is deeply rooted in 
misinformation, while the facts have been ignored outright. 
11. Request for Temporary Orders and Injunction 
8. The requests outlined in this section are baseless and appear designed 
to harass and complicate co-parenting. Cohabitation was maintained for 
45 days post-divorce announcement, disrupted only by court 
intervention on false pretenses. Once again, the opposing Party must 
maintain the need for protection despite cohabiting without court 
intervention for 46 days, during which I was served three times. 
Respondent would ironically argue that the protection would have made 
more sense if been filed by himself rather than the Petitioner.

Protective Order was denied, and was filed maliciously, illustrating the 
baselessness of claims for protection. The cohabitation achieved 
aforementioned directly contradicts the need for such orders.  
15. Request for Temporary Orders Concerning Use of Property 
11. Petitioner's Counsel requested temporary orders despite orders

Violence. 
16. Attorney's Fees, Expenses, Costs, and Interest

securing legal services from Cooper L. Carter, as she expressed her lack 
of desire to represent the Petitioner for the divorce case, only seeming

represent the Petitioner had it not been required by the Honorable 
Judge of this Court, as corroborated by the oversights pointed out within 
this document. 
17. Prayer 
13. Petitioner's prayer, based on temporary injunctions and orders, is 
plagued by inconsistencies and contradictions, with no regard for the 
children's well-being. This is further compounded by the lack of 
competence from the opposing Counsel to get crucial facts such as the 
living arrangements in line 6. 
RESPONDENT’S PRAYER 
Respondent, Charles Dustin Myers, affirms under penalty of perjury that the

Therefore, Respondent earnestly requests that the Court grant the following relief: 
1. Reset the case to restore the conditions prior to court intervention. 
 
2. Set a fair and expedited hearing to address these matters thoroughly, ensuring 
all parties can present their case and the children's best interests are held 
paramount. Respondent suggests a hearing date for March 14th, 2024 as the 
Opposing Counsel has already disclosed this availability, and the Court has 
already set time aside for this date in regards to the EMERGENCY MOTION 
filed, as referenced on page 1 of this document. 
 
3. Consider the pattern of deceit and manipulation exhibited by the Petitioner 
throughout these proceedings, and the operation of non-facts by opposing 
Counsel, and weigh any new claims with a heightened level of scrutiny, as 
Respondent has retained consistent pleadings throughout this case. 
 
4. Award full custody to the Respondent, who is best positioned to meet the 
children's needs and provide a stable, nurturing environment, while also 
facilitating a constructive relationship with the Petitioner. 
 
 
5. Respondent reassures the Court that reinstating him to the family home and 
with full custody of his children poses no risk of harm or violence; on the 
contrary, it promises the continuation of peaceful cohabitation and the 
nurturing environment his daughters need. The Petitioner retains the right to 
remain in the home or choose alternate accommodations, but it is imperative 
for the children’s sake that their lives not be disrupted by ongoing litigation 
over baseless allegations.  
 
6. The Respondent will make an active and conscious effort to ensure the bond 
between the Petitioner and the children is upheld and is committed to ensuring 
that the children have unfettered access to both parents, a principle the 
Petitioner has willfully neglected. Awarding the Respondent custody will enable 
the children to sustain the stable and loving home they are accustomed to, 
without the unnecessary upheaval that has marked recent months.

Therefore, Respondent earnestly requests that the Court grant the following relief:

1.

Reset the case to restore the conditions prior to court intervention.

Set a fair and expedited hearing to address these matters thoroughly, ensuring
all parties can present their case and the children's best interests are held
paramount. Respondent suggests a hearing date for March 14", 2024 as the
Opposing Counsel has already disclosed this availability, and the Court has
already set time aside for this date in regards to the EMERGENCY MOTION
filed, as referenced on page 1 of this document.

Consider the pattern of deceit and manipulation exhibited by the Petitioner
throughout these proceedings, and the operation of non-facts by opposing
Counsel, and weigh any new claims with a heightened level of scrutiny, as
Respondent has retained consistent pleadings throughout this case.

Award full custody to the Respondent, who is best positioned to meet the
children's needs and provide a stable, nurturing environment, while also
facilitating a constructive relationship with the Petitioner.

Respondent reassures the Court that reinstating him to the family home and
with full custody of his children poses no risk of harm or violence; on the
contrary, it promises the continuation of peaceful cohabitation and the
nurturing environment his daughters need. The Petitioner retains the right to
remain in the home or choose alternate accommodations, but it is imperative
for the children’s sake that their lives not be disrupted by ongoing litigation
over baseless allegations.

The Respondent will make an active and conscious effort to ensure the bond
between the Petitioner and the children is upheld and is committed to ensuring
that the children have unfettered access to both parents, a principle the
Petitioner has willfully neglected. Awarding the Respondent custody will enable
the children to sustain the stable and loving home they are accustomed to,
without the unnecessary upheaval that has marked recent months.
