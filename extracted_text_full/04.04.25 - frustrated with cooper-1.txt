Cooper,
So you rush to defend a separate suit only to then file the incorrect motion, convince the 233rd that you have a legal
position, and then totally rely on your status as a licensed attorney to get anything accomplished in the case.
Your client, who is now immorally engaged during ongoing divorce proceedings, seems to think that she has any legal
possibility of winning this case.
Let's just examine the logic here:
1. You obtain orders through fraudulent means.
2. You then fail to prosecute the case for nearly a year.
3. You jump into action to defend an emergency situation that you've provided no opposition against.
4. You don't even understand the laws surrounding the case.
5. You then attempt to set a hearing on an improperly filed motion in concert with the court coordinator, who isn't even
aware of her own duties.
6. You have a pro-se litigant constantly putting you in your place, and somehow think you're going to be able to justify all
of this misconduct.
7. ESPECIALLY when you rush to defend a suit, and then now aren't available until the end of April?
8. This is an embarrassment to the judicial system, and it's questionable as to how you even became eligible to practice
law given your inability to practice correctly or ethically.
9. We both know you have no legal arguments against my position, otherwise you would've made them by now.
10. I'm not stopping until you're both held accountable and my kids are properly cared for, and I can begin to repair
the extensive damages that have been caused by both of your negligence. Settlement is only optional if you decide to
stop this nonsense on your own free will, otherwise you will both be held accountable as you rightfully deserve to be.
11. All of this delay for relief, and in the end you end up filing the wrong motion, make no arguments, fail to address the
objection made, and expect to set a hearing prior to fulfilling your mandatory obligations under the Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure, and better yet - set it weeks from now when it's not even properly before the court.
12. I suggest following the law, otherwise the case just keeps stacking against you both, and is embarrassing for the
court. 
13. Your constant delays don't dishearten me - they empower me further as they showcase your weakness.
Therefore, we have one court refusing to hear properly filed motions by a self-represented litigant before it, and another
court attempting to set hearings on an improperly filed motion from a licensed attorney.
The irony here is thick. Not sure the point of risking everything for someone who has nothing to lose, and who has the law
on his side.
The fact that either of you refuse to communicate whatsoever showcases the true intent here. It's not for the kids at all,
never has been.

Cooper,

So you rush to defend a separate suit only to then file the incorrect motion, convince the 233rd that you have a legal
position, and then totally rely on your status as a licensed attorney to get anything accomplished in the case.

Your client, who is now immorally engaged during ongoing divorce proceedings, seems to think that she has any legal
possibility of winning this case.

Let's just examine the logic here:

1. You obtain orders through fraudulent means.

2. You then fail to prosecute the case for nearly a year.

3. You jump into action to defend an emergency situation that you've provided no opposition against.
4. You don't even understand the laws surrounding the case.

5. You then attempt to set a hearing on an improperly filed motion in concert with the court coordinator, who isn't even
aware of her own duties.

6. You have a pro-se litigant constantly putting you in your place, and somehow think you're going to be able to justify all
of this misconduct.

7. ESPECIALLY when you rush to defend a suit, and then now aren't available until the end of April?

8. This is an embarrassment to the judicial system, and it's questionable as to how you even became eligible to practice
law given your inability to practice correctly or ethically.

9. We both know you have no legal arguments against my position, otherwise you would've made them by now.

10. I'm not stopping until you're both held accountable and my kids are properly cared for, and | can begin to repair
the extensive damages that have been caused by both of your negligence. Settlement is only optional if you decide to
stop this nonsense on your own free will, otherwise you will both be held accountable as you rightfully deserve to be.
11. All of this delay for relief, and in the end you end up filing the wrong motion, make no arguments, fail to address the

You're simply in the same boat: avoiding accountability.
I've been straight forward this entire time, transparent, and have followed the rules.
I'll be weighing my options over the weekend, and any notice of hearing filed will be met with a swift Writ of Prohibition
proceeding filed in the Second Court of Appeals to prevent the court from entertaining a motion without jurisdiction to do
so.
I already have it written, I'm just waiting on the notice of hearing.
If you would read the pleadings served on you, maybe that would clear all of this up.
Just a thought. 
Have a good weekend,
Charlie
