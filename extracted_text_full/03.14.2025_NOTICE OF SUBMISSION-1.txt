9. Most disturbing is that this settlement agreement permitted the Petitioner
to remove her children from their own home for an entire month – a clear 
disregard for their well being – and the court signed off on this. 
10. Further, this agreement was challenged via a motion to reconsider which
was denied on March 14th, 2024, but Judge Kaitcer. 
11. To date, no findings of fact or conclusions of law have been issued
regarding this ruling despite notifying the court that they are past-due. 
12. At the hearing on March 14th, 2024, the docket reflects only the
Respondent appearing before the court. 
13. Just prior to the hearing, Respondent was served the current orders by
COOPER L. CARTER, not DAN BACALIS, just minutes before the hearing was 
to commence that was filed to challenge them. 
14. Despite the agreement stating that a typed written order shall be
prepared by Dan Bacalis, despite the 20 day time limit, and despite the five day 
review period that all parties and Judge Kaitcer agreed to -  the orders were 
permitted to be prepared at the last minute by COOPER L. CARTER, well after the 
20-day deadline, and despite the Respondent’s consent not being present, he was
ordered to sign the agreement in violation of Texas Law by 1:30 P.M. that same 
day.

15. The above order clearly shows two distinct handwritings – one from
COOPER L. CARTER, and one from Judge Kaitcer – ‘for his business’ – showing 
a pre-determined outcome. 
III. CONCLUSION
16. There is no doubt that this matter is filled with deception and unethical
practices. The Petitioner, in an effort to conceal her marital affair, had no problem 
taking her own children out of their home, falsifying her financial status after 
converting funds from the marital estate with the assistance of a third party,

claiming financial responsibility over property paid for by the Respondent, 
fabricating the existence of protective orders, instigating frivolous eviction suits, 
and falsifying the need for protection. 
17. On December 22, 2023, Petitioner filed for a protective order despite
already claiming to have one in effect in her original petition for divorce, yet text 
evidence clearly shows the Petitioner at home with Respondent on this same day – 
showing no need of protection as they continued to cohabit up until January 16th, 
2024. 
18. There exists no legal basis for the court’s continued stonewalling.
19. Therefore, continued disregard for the well-being of the Children and
Respondent’s rights must cease. 
20. Issue relief by granting summary judgment in Respondent's favor
without delay.
