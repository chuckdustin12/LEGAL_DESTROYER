Petitioner,

EMERGENCY MOTION FOR TRO

MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS,

Respondent.

2025-03-24

TO THE HONORABLE COURT:

Petitioner, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS ("Father"), urgently brings before this
court an EMERGENCY MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER to be
issued immediately and without prior notice to the Respondent, MORGAN MICHELLE
MYERS ("Mother"), for the safety and welfare of their two minor children M.E.M. and
C.R.M., the parties' biological children. The Respondent has been informed of this

request for a TRO as well as her attorney, COOPER L. CARTER. Petitioner has received

no response from either individual. Swift injunctive relief is needed to safeguard the well-
being of the children – including immediate medical needs, schooling needs, financial 
needs, and emotional needs that the Petitioner has the ability, desire, and duty to satisfy. 
The Respondent has disrupted the stable living environment enjoyed by the 
children up until the Petitioner's unlawful exclusion on March 6, 2024. They have been 
left without a Father for over thirteen months without any legal justification and are now 
being raised by their elderly great-grandparents in place of their Father. 
The forthcoming and undisputed facts uncover the true intent behind the 
Respondent's actions and clearly demonstrate the need for the Petitioner's immediate re-
entry into their lives. 
I. STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION 
This Court has jurisdiction, and the authority grants the requested relief because 
no valid existing orders bar such action. The only prior orders affecting the parties were 
issued in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County, but those orders are void and of no 
legal effect. Under Texas Family Code § 201.013(b), an associate judge's order does not 
become final unless and until the referring district court judge signs the order. 
Moreover, the orders claim that all parties agree to the terms of the order despite 
the Petitioner's signature being absent. In the prior proceedings (Cause Nos. 322-744263-
23 in the 322nd District Court), an associate judge signed a "temporary" order on March 
14, 2024 that purported to be an agreement between the parties. Critically, no district 
judge of the 322nd District Court ever signed or adopted that order, as required by law. 
TEX. FAM. CODE Sec. 201.013. Given this fact, the orders have no legal effect and

should be declared void by this court, or in the alternative, voidable, and vacated without 
delay. There is effectively no valid court order currently governing the parties' residence 
or conservatorship rights. This Court may therefore proceed to protect the children's 
welfare and the parties' rights as justice requires, unimpeded by the defective 322nd 
District Court order. 
Furthermore, this court has jurisdiction because the Respondent cannot argue that 
the related cause number retains dominated jurisdiction. Texas law does allow a court to 
lose dominant jurisdiction if the party with the first suit proceeded in bad faith or the suit 
is not actively pursued. Both apply here, as demonstrated below. The first suit was 
unquestionably brought in bad faith, and the case hasn't been actively pursued for over 
six months by the opposition, leaving the children in procedural limbo and their needs 
unaddressed. 
II. STATEMENT OF FACTS 
1. On December 12, 2023, Petitioner discovered over 6,500 text messages 
exchanged between the Respondent and an individual named DAMEN GAULT 
KAZLAUSKAS by checking the usage history on the joint AT&T account owned by the 
Respondent's grandmother and paid for by the Petitioner, who had access to the account. 
(these records are voluminous and will be provided at hearing) 
2. On December 14, 2023, in response to this discovery, the Respondent made 
plans to visit the residence of an individual named DANIEL KENNETH 
BRANTHOOVER, her stepfather.

57. On December 12, 2024, the Petitioner filed a NOTICE OF REMOVAL with

the 322nd District Court, and removed the case to the Northern District of Texas.

58. On December 14, 2024, the case was REMANDED by the Northern District

of Texas for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

59. On January 12, 2025, Petitioner filed a MOTION TO DISMISS FOR WANT

OF PROSECUTION.

60. On March 18, 2025, Petitioner filed an original SAPCR and motion for

injunctive relief with this court.

61. On March 22, 2025, the Petitioner learned through a family member that

Respondent's public Facebook profile states "In a Relationship since February, 2024".

62. On March 22, 2025, the Petitioner informed the opposing party of this motion.

63. On March 23, 2025, the Petitioner filed this suit with this court seeking
immediate and emergency relief given the extraordinary circumstances leading up to this

point.

I. IMMEDIATE NEED FOR RELIEF

64. Every day that Petitioner remains barred from his home and children inflicts
irreparable injury on both Petitioner and the children. Irreparable harm means an injury
that cannot be adequately compensated for money damages or corrected later. That is

exactly the case here.

65. Petitioner is being deprived of the irreplaceable experience of parenting his 
children during their formative years. No amount of monetary compensation or later 
visitation can make up for the lost time, missed milestones, and emotional bonding that 
has been denied for over a year. Courts have recognized that interference with custodial 
or visitation rights constitutes irreparable harm, as time lost with one's child is gone 
forever. The children are likewise losing the benefit of a father's love, guidance, and daily 
care – a harm that is unquestionably irreparable. If this wrongful separation continues, the 
risk increases that the parent-child bond could be permanently damaged. Reunification 
becomes harder as more time passes; thus the urgency is extreme. 
66. The children have been suffering confusion, instability, and emotional distress 
due to the sudden absence of Petitioner and the drastic changes imposed by Respondent. 
They went from having both parents in their daily life to seeing only one parent, with no 
satisfactory explanation. Respondents' insertion of a new father-figure (Mr. Kazlauskas) 
has exacerbated their confusion and anxiety. This kind of emotional turmoil in young 
children can lead to long-term psychological issues – a classic irreparable injury, as the 
court cannot later repair the trauma inflicted on a child's sense of security. Restoring 
Petitioner's presence is needed now to begin healing the damage and to reassure the 
children that their father has not abandoned them. The more time that passes, the deeper 
the potential harm to the children's mental health. 
67. Petitioner's fundamental right to maintain his familial relationship with his 
children (protected by the U.S. and Texas Constitutions) is being violated. Such a 
violation is inherently irreparable. Deprivation of one's home – being ousted without 
cause – is also a profound personal harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law.

Petitioner has effectively been made a stranger to his own family and property based on 
false pretenses. If the Court does not act, the Petitioner will continue to suffer intangible 
harms such as loss of income, anguish, and the erosion of his role as a father, none of 
which can be quantified or compensated later. 
IV. THE RESPONDENT'S MISCONDUCT 
Perjury and Aggravated Perjury (Tex. Penal Code §§ 37.02–.03) 
68. Texas law makes it a crime to make false statements under oath. Perjury 
occurs when a person, with intent to deceive, makes a false statement under oath in a 
proceeding where an oath is required. 
69. If the false statement is made in connection with an "official proceeding" and 
is material, it becomes Aggravated Perjury, a third-degree felony. In civil cases, 
knowingly submitting false affidavits or testimony can also constitute perjury and be 
treated as a fraud upon the court. Courts have recognized that false sworn statements in 
family law matters are serious misconduct, undermining the judicial process and 
potentially warranting sanctions or even criminal referral (e.g., Skepnek v. Mynatt, 8 
S.W.3d 377, 381 (Tex. App. – El Paso 1999) (attorney sanctioned $30,000 for filing false 
affidavit). 
70. Here, Respondent swore to multiple false statements under oath, meeting all 
elements of perjury and aggravated perjury. For example:

IV. THE RESPONDENT'S MISCONDUCT

Perjury and Aggravated Perjury (Tex. Penal Code §§ 37.02-.03)

68. Texas law makes it a crime to make false statements under oath. Perjury
occurs when a person, with intent to deceive, makes a false statement under oath in a

proceeding where an oath is required.

69. If the false statement is made in connection with an "official proceeding" and
is material, it becomes Aggravated Perjury, a third-degree felony. In civil cases,
knowingly submitting false affidavits or testimony can also constitute perjury and be
treated as a fraud upon the court. Courts have recognized that false sworn statements in

affidavit).

70. Here, Respondent swore to multiple false statements under oath, meeting all

elements of perjury and aggravated perjury. For example:

False Affidavit of Indigency

=== PAGE 14 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
71. On December 18, 2023, Respondent filed a sworn "Affidavit of Inability to 
Pay" court costs, claiming she had only $20 in her bank account. This statement was 
knowingly false. Just two days prior, Respondent had transferred $1,576.00 in marital 
funds to herself, as confirmed by text messages with her relative (Dan Branthoover) on 
December 16. She then appeared in court swearing she was penniless and could not 
afford the $400 filing fee. In that same affidavit, Respondent also lied that she alone paid 
certain expenses (two car loans and $800 rent plus utilities), when in fact Petitioner had 
been paying those bills; he continued to pay for the vehicles Respondent claimed to 
finance on her own. Bank statements and financial records will clearly establish this fact 
on the merits. Respondent's counsel has never refuted these facts. Thus, Respondent 
made multiple false statements under oath, meeting Penal Code § 37.02. Because these 
affidavits were filed in court proceedings and were material to the case (securing a fee 
waiver and influencing the court's actions), they also qualify as aggravated perjury under 
§ 37.03. Each false statement was material to issues before the court (Respondent's 
financial status and credibility), satisfying the materiality requirement. 
False Statements in Protective Order Filings 
72. Respondent submitted false sworn statements in her applications for 
protective orders. Texas Family Code § 82.009 requires that an application for a 
temporary ex parte protective order "contain a detailed description of the facts" of alleged 
family violence and be sworn as true by the applicant. Respondent sought an ex parte 
protective order on or about Dec. 14, 2023, claiming abuse, yet on Dec. 22, 2023, she 
was photographed laughing and playing with the children alongside Petitioner – conduct 
wholly inconsistent with someone in fear of imminent harm. In fact, that same day, she

had applied for a second protective order against the Petitioner with similar allegations. 
No credible evidence of family violence was ever presented in thirteen months of 
litigation but has been used as a barrier from accessing the home where the Petitioner is 
needed. 
73. The contextual evidence of falsity (her normal familial behavior with 
Petitioner the same day she sought Protection) defeated her sworn claims of "fear" or 
violence and display that they were indeed fabricated. At the very least, her contradictory 
sworn assertions – e.g. claiming on Dec. 18 to have an "active" protective order based on 
family violence (to justify a divorce waiver) when in truth none existed – demonstrate a 
reckless disregard for the truth under oath. 
74. These false protective order filings were not isolated incidents but part of a 
calculated strategy to remove Petitioner from the family home and children's lives. The 
timing of these filings—immediately after the discovery of Respondent's extramarital 
relationship with Mr. Kazlauskas—reveals their true purpose: not to protect against 
genuine violence, but to preemptively silence Petitioner and prevent him from exposing 
Respondent's infidelity and financial misconduct. By falsely claiming fear while 
simultaneously engaging in normal family activities with Petitioner, Respondent 
demonstrated the fabricated nature of her allegations. 
75. The pattern of deception is unmistakable: Respondent drained the family bank 
account on December 15-16, filed false indigency claims on December 18, falsely 
claimed an existing protective order in her divorce petition that same day, then filed yet 
another protective order application on December 22—all while continuing to interact

premeditated plan to use the legal system as a weapon against Petitioner rather than as the 
shield of protection it was designed to be. 
Controlling Law 
76. False testimony or affidavits in a civil proceeding can warrant severe 
consequences. While the proper remedy for "intrinsic" fraud (false statements on issues 
litigated at trial) is often a new trial or sanctions rather than voiding a judgment, courts do 
not hesitate to act on clear perjury. Texas courts have inherent authority to address fraud 
on the court, and criminal prosecution for aggravated perjury is a possibility for egregious 
lies under oath. Indeed, aggravated perjury in court proceedings is a felony punishable by 
2–10 years' imprisonment (Tex. Penal Code § 37.03(b)). 
77. That is precisely what has occurred in this case, and Respondent should face 
some consequences for her actions, but Petitioner believes that prolonged incarceration 
would not be in the best interests of his children, but that some form of legal repercussion 
is necessary to deter similar behavior in the future. She has made no effort to defend 
these claims, no effort to prosecute her case, and the Petitioner prays that this court 
realize the severity of this situation on those effected most: the children.

79. Here, this statutory mandate was grossly violated by the Respondent and her 
purported counsel, who have suddenly become active in the litigation here despite 
remaining silent for over eight months in the parallel case destined for dismissal. 
80. Indeed, the instant case reveals a Mother with an agenda to erase the parent 
the children relied on the most from their lives despite a valid legal reason, and has 
disregarded their livelihood in the process. 
81. Respondent's conduct constitutes a blatant violation of the "best interest" 
standard mandated by Texas Family Code §§ 153.001 and 153.002. Texas law declares it 
the public policy of this state to assure that children have frequent and continuing contact 
with parents who act in the child's best interest, to provide a safe and stable environment 
for the child, and to encourage both parents to share in raising the child. Moreover, the 
best interest of the child must always be the court's primary consideration in matters of 
conservatorship and access. Respondent has flagrantly defied these principles by 
prioritizing her extramarital relationship with Mr. Damen Kazlauskas over the emotional, 
psychological, and familial stability of her own children. 
Orchestrated Campaign of Deception at the Family's Expense

83. First, Respondent engaged in an extramarital relationship with Mr. Kazlauskas 
(evidenced by over 6,500 text messages); 
84. Second, upon discovery of this relationship, she immediately sought 
assistance from Mr. Branthoover to draft legal documents; 
85. Third, she drained the family's financial resources ($1,576) that were intended 
for the children's Christmas gifts; 
86. Fourth, she filed false protective order applications and a fraudulent indigency 
affidavit; 
87. Fifth, she misrepresented to the court that an active protective order existed 
when none did; 
88. Finally, she used these fraudulent filings to remove Petitioner from the family 
home and children's lives. 
89. Each step in this sequence was designed not to protect the children but to 
advance Respondent's personal agenda at their expense. The children have been collateral 
damage in Respondent's effort to reconstruct her life with Mr. Kazlauskas, who she now 
publicly acknowledges as her partner "since February 2024"—a relationship that began 
while she was still actively living with Petitioner and the children.

wreaks emotional havoc on the children. They are left in a state of confusion—believing 
their family has been permanently fractured when in fact the legal marriage remains 
intact. By intentionally misrepresenting such a fundamental truth, Respondent has shown 
a willingness to confuse and emotionally harm her children to justify her own choices, in 
direct contravention of her duty to prioritize the children's emotional well-being. 
Prioritizing an Extramarital Relationship Over Family 
91. Compounding the harm, Respondent is openly celebrating a relationship with 
Mr. Kazlauskas – a man with whom she entered an extramarital relationship while still 
married to Petitioner. She has flaunted this relationship and positioned Mr. Kazlauskas as 
a replacement father figure to the children, celebrating milestones with him that should be 
reserved for family. In doing so, Respondent elevates her personal relationship over her 
children's need for stability and continuity with their real father. This behavior sends the 
children a disturbing message: that their father's role in their lives is interchangeable or 
unimportant. Such a message is detrimental to the children's best interests, as it 
undermines their sense of security, identity, and trust in their family structure and the 
close relationship that they have shared with their father throughout their lives. 
Active Alienation and Erasure of the Father

of Texas public policy, which seeks to ensure children maintain frequent and continuing

93. Instead of fostering the father–child relationship, Respondent has deliberately 
attempted to sever it. The children are being taught through Respondent's words and 
actions that their father has effectively disappeared and been substituted by a stranger,

This behavior is not only cruel; it is directly contrary to the children's best interests and 
Texas's clear directives that children benefit from the love and involvement of both 
parents.

great-grandparents rather than their capable and willing father—further demonstrates 
how Respondent's personal agenda has superseded the children's needs. Rather than 
allowing Petitioner to fulfill his parental role and provide daily care and support to the 
children, Respondent has relegated this responsibility to extended family members, 
depriving the children of their father's presence, guidance, and care during crucial 
developmental years.

95. The harm to the children from this prolonged, unjustified separation from their 
father cannot be overstated. Research consistently shows that children benefit from the 
active involvement of both parents, and that unnecessary disruption of the parent-child 
bond can cause lasting psychological damage. By prioritizing her personal relationship 
over her children's need for both parents, Respondent has demonstrated a fundamental 
misalignment with the "best interest" standard that Texas law demands be the "primary 
consideration" in all matters affecting children.

will as she is the mother of his Children and only seeks an amicable path forward that 
suits their best interests. As of now, the Children need their father, and this situation 
engineered by the Respondent shows that her fitness as a parent has been called into

question, and her priorities are not in the correct place. Petitioner vows his return to the
family home will only bring much needed stability to his children and will be in their best

interests for their day-to-day livelihood.

VI. PRAYER

WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Petitioner respectfully prays that this

Honorable Court:

(1). Issue an immediate Temporary Restraining Order for the safety and welfare

of the children without notice to Respondent, restraining Respondent from:
