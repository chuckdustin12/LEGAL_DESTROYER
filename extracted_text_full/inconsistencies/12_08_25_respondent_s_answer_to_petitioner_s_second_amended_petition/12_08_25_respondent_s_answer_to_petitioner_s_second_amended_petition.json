Her newfound allegations of child abuse cannot be \nreconciled with her failure to offer any new sworn evidence and with the contrary proof already contained in the 3,900-page Mandamus Record. 2. Petitioner filed: (a) an Original Petition for Divorce under an Affidavit of Inability to Pay\non December 18, 2023; (b) a First Amended Petition filed \u201con her behalf\u201d by RODERICK D. MARX, a party not named in this suit, on January 31, 2024; and (c) the Sec ond Amended \nPetition filed on November 24, 2025, again signed and filed by RODERICK D. MARX, still not named as counsel of record in this cause. 3. All three petitions contain statements known to be false, misrepresent the children\u2019s\ncircumstances, and facially call into question the authority of Cooper L. Carter, Petitioner\u2019s alleged counsel, as alleged throughout this case and in Respondent\u2019s Rule 12 challenge.  \n4. The Second Amended Petition for Divorce does not correct the misstatements identified\nin Respondent\u2019s prior pleadings; it compounds them. Petitioner continues to allege a \u201chistory or pattern of family violence, child abuse, and child neglect\u201d and seeks to deny Respondent access to his children even though: (1) the Title 4 protective-order proceeding was nonsuited and produced no finding of family violence ( M.3457; see also M.1346, M.2858), (2) Petitioner\u2019s \nsworn claim of an \u201cactive protective order\u201d with a prior finding of family violence is demonstrably false ( M.78; see also M.2858, M.3784), (3) Petitioner\u2019s sworn separation date of \nDecember 1, 2023 is contradicted by photographic and documentary evidence of cohabitation through late December and January (M.210, M.1714, M.1346, M.2858), and (4) Petitioner\u2019s",

These misstatements are not isolated; they appear across multiple filings, including \nPetitioner\u2019s divorce petitions and her protective-order application, and are exposed by \nRespondent\u2019s mandamus materials. Each time Respondent exposes a falsehood \u2014by providing \ntext-message logs, third-party affidavits, bank and PayPal records, and court orders \u2014Petitioner \nand her counsel do not correct the record. They instead file another amended petition repeating and amplifying the same accusations, without engaging wit h the 3,900-page mandamus record \nthat refutes them (see, e.g.,  M.3 , M.245, M.2536, M.2538, M.2858, M.3457, M.3762, M.3784). \n6. Under these circumstances, the Court may reasonably find that the Second Amended \nPetition is not the product of an honest mistake but of a deliberate strategy to maintain control of the residence and the children through inflammatory but unsubstantiated al legations ( M.1346, \nM.245, M.2536, M.2858, M.3457, M.3762, M.3784). The pattern satisfies the standard for bad-\nfaith pleadings and sanctions under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 13 and Chapter 10 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, or dismiss the case outright as requested in the prayer for relief within the Respondent\u2019s No-Evidence Summary Judgement awaiting adjudication from this Court.  \nII. UNREBUTTED ALLEGATIONS SHOULD BE DEEMED ADMITTED  \n7. Petitioner never addresses the financial misconduct that triggered this litigation. The \nmandamus record documents that on December 15, 2023, Petitioner caused $1,576 from the marital estate to be transferred using a third party\u2019s PayPal account in order to  conceal marital \nfunds from the Court (M.1688).

In separate \ncorrespondence, Respondent expressly identifies the same December 15, 2023 conversion and \ndemands that the $1,576 \u201cyou converted on December 15, 2023\u201d be returned, tying it directly to Petitioner\u2019s and Mr. Branthoover\u2019s coordinated conduct (M.1760). Petitioner has never filed any \nresponse, affidavit, or amended pleading that denies, explains, or corrects this sequence of events, despite clear notice of the allegation and the supporting transaction records (M.1692, \nM.3457\u20133458). \n8. Similarly, Petitioner has never attempted to reconcile her sworn claim of an \u201cactive \nprotective order\u201d with a prior finding of family violence with the actual procedural history. In the materials filed contemporaneously with the divorce, Petitioner affirmatively states that she \u201cha[s] an active protective order or an active magistrate's order for emergency protection against my spouse\u2026 [and] [t]he order includes a finding that my spouse committed family violence\u201d (M.78). Respondent\u2019s mandamus narrative and exhibits show that no such prior finding exists, \nthat the protective-order proceeding was later nonsuited or otherwise resolved without any adverse finding against Respondent, and that Petitioner used the supposed \u201cexisting\u201d order to waive the sixty -day waiting period and to justify ex parte relief ( M.1692, M.1759, M.3457\u2013\n3458). Even after Respondent repeatedly exposed this falsehood in detailed filings, Petitioner\u2019s \nSecond Amended Petition simply repeats the \u201chistory or pattern\u201d language and never confronts the fact that her original \u201cactive protective order\u201d representation was materially untrue ( M.210, \nM.1759). \n9. Petitioner and her counsel likewise ignore the long -standing challenge to Cooper L. \nCarter\u2019s authority and the undisputed involvement of Roderick D. Marx, who is not named as counsel of record in this cause. The mandamus record recites that M s. Carter \u201chas been under",

Respondent\u2019s materials quote \nMs. Carter\u2019s own language that \u201cIt was necessary for Petitioner to acquire the services of \nCOOPER L. CARTER\u201d and set that assertion against the reality that Marx \u2014who lacks any \nappearance in this case\u2014continues  to submit critical pleadings, including the First and Second \nAmended Petitions ( M.1688, M.210). Petitioner offers no explanation for this discrepancy, no \nsworn clarification of who actually represents her, and no response to the Rule 12 challenge, yet continues to seek extraordinary relief based on pleadings filed under this clouded authority (M.1688). \n10. Finally, Petitioner has never made a credible, evidence-based showing that the children \nare presently in danger , have ever been in danger, or that the existing orders serve their best \ninterests , which they claim do not exist at all in the live pleading ; instead, she relies on escalating \nrhetoric untethered to new facts. Respondent\u2019s mandamus exhibits include images and  \ndescriptions of Mother and the children together at the home after the alleged \u201cemergency\u201d and after the filing of the protective-order application, depicting normal, playful interactions rather than any imminent threat ( M.1713\u20131714). Respondent\u2019s correspondence to Mr. Branthoover \nexpressly pleads for \u201cstability to my children\u2019s lives and my life\u201d and ties the instability directly to the fraudulent filings and misuse of protective-order and divorce procedures (M.1760). The \nmandamus narrative also details the impact of Petitioner\u2019s actions on the children\u2019s housing and access to their father, while the Second Amended Petition offers no new sworn evidence that the current orders are harming the children or that a furthe r restriction on Respondent\u2019s access is \nnecessary ( M.3457\u20133458, M.1576\u20131577).

The mandamus record also details concrete economic and emotional damages flowing \ndirectly from Petitioner\u2019s conduct. In discovery responses, Respondent identifies \u201ceconomic damages claimed by the Respondent\u201d and specifically lists \u201cattorney fees [and] unau thorized \ntransfer of funds from a third party on December 15th, 2023, for the amount of $1,560\u201d as part of the harm for which he seeks recovery (M.789). In his counterpetition, Respondent further asserts \na claim for conversion of community property \u201camounting to $1,576 on December 15th, 2023,\u201d as well as intentional infliction of emotional distress and civil conspiracy against Petitioner\u2019s agents for \u201cplanning, meeting, and filing of three concurrent lawsuits for the sole intention of having the Counter -petitioner removed from the residency and interfering with his constitutional \nrights of the care, control, and custody of his Children\u201d (M.1126). Petitioner has never \ncontroverted these specific damages allegations or offered any innocent explanation for the coordinated eviction and conversion described in those pleadings. 12. Respondent likewise explains to law enforcement that the loss of the residence is not \nmerely symbolic, but directly tied to his ability to work and support the children. In his detailed letter to the Watauga Police Department, Respondent states that \u201csigni ficant damages\u2026 have \noccurred from being unable to work from out of the home which has directly impacted [the children\u2019s] financial livelihood,\u201d making clear that the home functions as both residence and place of business ( M.1694).

From the outset of this litigation, Respondent has consistently framed Petitioner\u2019s \nconduct in terms of fraud and civil conspiracy, not mere mistake. In his counter -petition section \ntitled \u201cCIVIL CONSPIRACY AND FRAUD,\u201d  Respondent pleads that the record \u201cproves civil \nconspiracy on its face\u201d through text evidence and other materials already on file with the clerk (M.1083). He alleges that Petitioner, acting in concert with Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, \n\u201cknowingly and willingly filed fraudulent divorce paperwork\u201d by claiming an active order of protection existed against Respondent, \u201cwith intent to deceive and with knowledge of the statement's meaning,\u201d for the purpose of acquiring property and gaining an advantage in the divorce (M.1085). Respondent further requests relief that includes damages for the \u201cfraudulent \ntransfer of marital assets,\u201d expressly tying Branthoover\u2019s and Petitioner\u2019s conduct to a scheme to remove Respondent from the residence and strip him of access to community fun ds (M.1085, \nM.1088). He also characterizes the temporary orders as \u201cerroneous and fraudulently rendered,\u201d \nexplaining that a Title IV intervention rests on those defective orders rather than on any independent factual understanding of the case (M.1111 ). \n14. Respondent\u2019s later filings reinforce that same fraud theory with specific factual detail. In \nhis March 4, 2025 cover letter to the Watauga Police Department, he describes \u201cfraudulent documents that were prepared and presented\u201d on December 18, 2023, leading to his \u201cunjust removal\u201d from the residence and asks the department to acknowledge that \u201cthe court orders",

In a separate motion to compel and deem \nadmissions, Respondent states plainly that, \u201cOn December 15, 2023, Petitioner defrauded the marital estate by transferring $1,576 to a third party without Respondent\u2019s consent,\u201d and he explains that she then refus ed to answer Requests for Admission that would have required her to \nadmit this fraudulent transfer and the related eviction tactic ( M.2855\u20132856). In his mandamus \nnarrative, Respondent recounts that he asserted affirmative defenses of \u201cfraud, illegality, and duress,\u201d supported by his TxDPS record and exhibits highlighting inconsistencies in Petitioner\u2019s petition ( M.3455). Petitioner never confronts any of these fraud allegations on the merits, never \nexplains why these orders and filings are not fraudulent, and instead files a Second Amended Petition that ignores this history while escalating accusations against Responden t\u2014further \nconfirming the bad- faith, damage -causing pattern already documented in the mandamus record.  \nIII. LEVEL OF EGREGIOUSNESS AND IMPACT ON THE CHILDREN  \n15. The egregiousness of Petitioner\u2019s conduct lies not only in the sheer number of false \nstatements, but in the way those statements have been used to separate two young children from their father and then left unprosecuted once they achieved that result. Peti tioner obtained \npossession of the residence and effective control of the children by claiming an active protective order with a prior finding of family violence that never existed (M.78, M.1692\u20131693, M.3457\u2013\n3458), by converting community funds on December 15, 2023 (M.1688, M.1760), and by \npushing through temporary orders that are  later described as \u201cerroneous and fraudulently \nrendered\u201d in light of the record (M.1111 ).

This pattern has real, tangible consequences for the children. Respondent\u2019s mandamusfilings explain that the residence functioned as both family home and workplace, and that \u201csignificant damages\u2026 have occurred from being unable to work from out of the hom e which \nhas directly impacted [the children\u2019s] financial livelihood\u201d ( M.1694). The forced lockout and \nloss of the residence on March 6, 2024 flowed from fraudulent filings and misrepresentations, not from any adjudicated finding of danger to the children (M.1076, M.1692\u20131694, M.3457). At \nthe same time, Petitioner exposed the children to a new boyfriend, attempted to install a replacement father figure, and refused to foster normal communication between the children and Respondent, all while insisting in pleadings that the existing or ders either do not exist or do not \ngo far enough (M.1694, M.1713\u20131714, M.1576\u20131577). \n17. Respondent\u2019s damages claims underscore that this is not a victimless paperwork dispute.\nHe pleads economic losses in the form of attorney\u2019s fees and the unauthorized $1,576 transfer from the marital estate ( M.789, M.1126, M.2855\u20132856), and he alleges intentional infliction of \nemotional distress and civil conspiracy based on \u201cplanning, meeting, and filing of three concurrent lawsuits for the sole intention of having the Counter-petitioner removed from the residency and interfering with his constitutional rights of the care, control, and custody of his Children\u201d (M.1126).

That level of bad faith \u2014\nsustained over years, in multiple courts, and at the direct expense of the children\u2019s relationship with their father and their financial stability \u2014strongly supports striking the Second Amended \nPetition and imposing sanctions under Rule 13 and Chapter 10, rather than rewarding a strategy that treats perjury and fraud on the court as acceptable tools of custody litigation ( M.1083, \nM.1085, M.1088, M.1692\u20131694, M.2855\u2013 2856, M.3455\u20133458). \nIV.

Cases such as Brandon v. Rudisel, In re A.L.E., In re B.O., In re R.M., and Holley hold \nthat: \ni. the best -interest standard and public policy (\u00a7\u00a7 153.001, 153.002) favor frequent and \ncontinuing contact with fit parents;  \nii. there is a rebuttable presumption that a standard possession order serves the child\u2019s best interest; and",

Other authorities expressly condemn conduct that obstructs a child\u2019s relationship with the \nother parent. In Cox v. Cox, the court treated a mother\u2019s false sexual -abuse reports, interference \nwith the father\u2019s employment, and instability as evidence contrary  to the children\u2019s best interests \nand as grounds for altering conservatorship.  22. In Marriage of Chandler and Gunther v. Gunther , the courts described unjustified \ninterference with a parent -child relationship as legally \u201creprehensible\u201d and affirmed modification \nwhere one parent deliberately hindered the children\u2019s ability to know, love, and be with the other parent.  \n23.

Phan, which confirm that failure to respond to serious, documented allegations and requests for admissions justifies treating those matters as conclusively proven and supports sanctions. The same materials recognize that when serious factual allegations are made and circumstances call for a reply, a",

The mandamus record shows that Respondent served Requests for Admissions andRequests for Production on September 17, 2024, that Petitioner never answered, and that she did not oppose the motion to compel. Under Rules 198.2(c) and 215.2(b), the admissions are deemed and sanctions up to striking pleadings are available. Petitioner\u2019s Second Amended Petition therefore directly conflicts with deemed admissions that no family violence occurred, that Respondent contributed to the family\u2019s stability through his work-from-home employment, and that Petitioner engaged in financial misconduct and self -help eviction. A pleading that contradicts \ndeemed admissions and the unrefuted record sits on legally untenable ground and is subject to being struck.  \nE. Rule 193.6 and Failure to Disclose Evidence or Testimony34. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 193.6 mandates exclusion of untimely disclosed evidenceand witnesses unless the offering party proves good cause or lack of unfair surprise or prejudice. The Texas Supreme Court in Fort Brown Villas III Condo. v. Gillenwater holds that Rule 193.6 applies in summary -judgment proceedings and that a party who fails to timely disclose evidence \nor witnesses may not introduce them absent the rule\u2019s narrow exceptions.  35. The \u201cNo Disclosure of Testimony\u201d memorandum explains that, while a named party\ngenerally may testify as a witness, Rule 193.6 still limits the scope of undisclosed subject matter and places the burden on the offering party to show good cause or lack of unfair surprise or prejudice, with the default remedy being exclusion of undisclosed evidence or a continuance.  \n36. Here, Petitioner has not disclosed any witness list, exhibit list, or responsive documents\ndespite Respondent\u2019s targeted discovery requests, including requests for financial records,",

The Mandamus Record supplies a comprehensive evidentiary backdrop: it documents thelack of any protective-order findings, the removal of Respondent without testimony in violation of Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7\u00a7 83.006 and 85.001, the self-help eviction and financial conversion, the unanswered discovery, and the Court\u2019s own obligation to apply the Holley factors and \u00a7 153.002 best-interest mandate.
