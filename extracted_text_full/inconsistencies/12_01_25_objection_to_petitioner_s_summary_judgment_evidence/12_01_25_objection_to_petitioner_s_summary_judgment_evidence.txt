Respondent ’s Objection to Petitioner’s Summary Judgment Evidence 
 
TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THIS COURT:  
 
1. Respondent OBJECTS to and moves to ST RIKE all evidence attached  to or referenced in 
Petitioner’s summary -judgment response . Petitioner’s exhibits consist of unauthenticated emails, 
screenshots, text messages, financial documents, and third -party affidavits that were never 
produced in discovery, are inadmissible hearsay, lack authentication, and fail to meet the 
requirements of competent summary -judgment evidence. Each category below independently 
requires exclusion.  
I. AUTOMATIC EXCLUSION FOR DISCOVERY ABUSE (RULE 193.6) 
2. Evidence not timely disclosed in discovery must be excluded from all proceedings, 
including summary judgment, unless the proponent establishes both good cause for the failure 
and absence of unfair surprise or prejudice. This exclusion is mandatory .  §

 3. Petitioner’s exhibits were never produced in response to written discovery requests  and 
were disclosed for the first time in a summary -judgment response. This is the precise type of trial 
by ambush Rule 193.6 prohibits. The record contains no showing of good cause and no proof of 
lack of prejudice . Accordingly, exclusion is automatic and required.  
II. LACK OF AUTHENTICATION (RULES 901 & 902)  
4. Texas Rule of Evidence 901 requires proof that evidence is what its proponent claims. 
Merely attaching documents to a response does not authenticate them.  Screenshots, emails, text 
messages, and PDFs are not self -authenticating  and require proof of authorship, creation, and 
integrity.  
III. HEARSAY (RULES 801–803)  
5. Petitioner’s exhibits consist almost entirely of out -of-court statements offered for the 
truth of the matters asserted . Emails, texts, and unsworn statements are classic hearsay  and 
inadmissible absence  a recognized exception. No exception has been established . Even  alleged 
party admissions remain inadmissible without proper authentication —which is entirely lacking 
here.  
IV . IMPROPER SUMMARY -JUDGMENT EVIDENCE (RULE 166a(f))  
6. Summary -judgment evidence must be:  
i. Sworn,  
ii. Based on personal knowledge,  
iii. Contain admissible facts, and  
iv. Show the affiant is competent to testify.

3 
 7. Unsworn screenshots, unauthenticated documents, and narrative statements are not 
competent evidence and cannot be considered . Conclusory, unfounded, or legally defective 
affidavits cannot create a fact issue under any circumstance.  
V. EFFECT ON NO -EVIDENCE SUMMARY JUDGMENT (RULE 166a(i))  
8. Once all untimely, unauthenticated, and hearsay materials are struck, Petitioner has 
produced no competent summary-judgment evidence on any challenged element . Under Rule 
166a(i), the Court must grant Respondent’s no-evidence motion as a matter of law . 
VI. PRESERVATION OF ERROR  
9. Accordingly, Respondent timely objects to the form, substance, and admissibility of 
Petitioner’s evidence and expressly moves to strike each exhibit in its entirety , thereby 
preserving all error for appellate review. 
VII. PRAYER  
10. Respondent respectfully requests that the Court:  
i. Sustain Respondent’s objections ; 
ii. Strike all of Petitioner’s challenged summary -judgment exhibits in their entirety ; 
iii. Refuse to consider the excluded materials for any purpose ; and  
iv. Grant Respondent’s No-Evidence Motion for Summary Judgment  because no competent 
evidence remains on any challenged element.  
v. Abate the final trial setting and;  
vi. Provide any further relief, both in law and equity  that the Court deems necessary .
