This isn't merely a letter; it's a reflection, a moment of introspection, and a heartfelt plea rooted in the\nlove and dreams we've shared. It's about the path we've walked together and the crossroad where we now stand, facing directions |\nnever thought we'd consider.\n\nThe recent events have cast a shadow over us, making it difficult to see beyond the immediate turmoil. Yet, despite the challenges\nand the heartache, there's a part of me that clings to a sliver of hope. This hope isn't born out of naivety but from a deep-seated belief\nin the strength and bond we've built over the years. It's a hope that, perhaps, there's a chance for us to pause, to reflect, and to\ncontemplate the gravity of the path we're on\u2014a path that seems to be tearing at the very fabric of our family, leading us away from\neach other and the essence of what once made us 'us.'\n\nAs | navigate through these sleepless nights, our memories\u2014those moments of joy, laughter, and even the challenges we faced\ntogether\u2014are a testament to what we've built. They remind me of a bond that was once unbreakable, capable of withstanding any\nstorm. It's heartbreaking to see how far we've drifted from those days, embroiled in a battle | never imagined we'd fight, a battle that\nseems to disregard the very heart of our family: our children.\n\nMorgan, this isn't a letter of blame but a call\u2014a call to the woman | fell in love with, the mother of our children, and the person with\nwhom I've shared the deepest and most meaningful moments of my life. It's a call to reflect on the implications of our current situation,\non the pain and confusion our daughters are experiencing. They're hurting, Morgan, and it's a pain that echoes through our home, a\nhome that once thrived on love, laughter, and unity.\n\nAll the work, the memories, the dreams we've shared\u2014they're not just remnants of the past; they're the foundation of what we can still\nhave. They're embedded deep within our souls, a reminder of what we're fighting for. I'm not ready to let go of that\u2014not without a fight.\nBut this fight isn't about winning or losing; it's about fighting for what's best for our children, for the chance to provide them with the\nstability, love, and care they desperately need.\n\nI'm reaching out to you, Morgan, not as an opponent but as a partner, a father, and a man who still believes in us. I'm asking you to\nconsider the path before us, to think about the impact of our actions on our daughters, and to remember the love that brought us\ntogether. Let's not allow the challenges we face to define our future or the legacy we leave for our children.\n\nThis is a call to come home, not just to the physical space we shared but to the essence of what made our house a home. It's a plea\nfor dialogue, for understanding, and for the chance to navigate this crossroad together, with the best interests of our daughters at\nheart.\n\nThe divorce, as outlined in our proceedings, brings to light the complexity and the gravity of our situation, emphasizing the need for us\nto approach this with the utmost care for our children's welfare. It's clear from the protective orders, the division of property, and the\ntemporary injunctions sought, that we're navigating through uncharted waters, with significant implications for our family's future.\n\nThis doesn't mean you lose, or | win. But rather, it means both of us win because we're putting aside the noise and doing what we've\nalways done well together: take care of our kids. We can get divorced and still be friends. We can get divorced and still do what's right\nby our daughters.\n\n| can forgive, and | can understand. Because throughout this nightmare, one thing has remained persistent: our love for our children\nand our desire to see them thrive. Let's choose the path to forgiveness, the path that leads us to a better future for our daughters,\nregardless of the challenges we face as individuals.\n",

      "text": "If the divorce is truly what you want, then let me give it to you, but in a way that won't sacrifice everything we've worked for. In a way\nthat doesn't shroud our marriage in darkness when there are endless beacons of light. In a way that allows me to continue being a\npart of our girls lives throughout the process. In a way that doesn't cost us thousands of dollars to hire people who have no concern for\nour daughters.\n\nAs you know, I've lived through this. It lasted a decade because both of my parents weren't thinking about what mattered - me and my\nbrothers.\n\n| can't re-live this nightmare, and | know this is not what you want either.\n| can accept the fact you no longer wish to be married to me - and | understand why.\n\nIf the divorce is truly what you desire, | am committed to facilitating it in a manner that honors the depth of our shared life and the well-\nbeing of our daughters. Unlike the contentious paths often taken, | believe there's a way to navigate this transition that respects the\nlove we've shared and the future of our family.\n\nOur divorce proceedings have laid bare the complex emotions and legal entanglements we're facing. From the division of our\ncommunity property to the considerations around our daughters\u2019 lives, every aspect underscores the gravity of our decisions now. Yet,\nin this complexity, | see an opportunity for us to choose a path less traveled\u2014a path of mutual respect, understanding, and shared\ncommitment to our children's future.\n\nThis journey need not be one of loss or bitterness. Instead, it can be a testament to our ability to rise above the hurt, to navigate our\ndifferences with grace, and to prioritize the emotional and psychological well-being of our daughters above all else. Our shared history,\nthe dreams we've nurtured together, and the challenges we've overcome are not erased by this divorce; they are, in fact, the very\nreasons we must strive to handle this transition with care and dignity.\n\nThe legal measures outlined\u2014from temporary orders to permanent injunctions\u2014serve as a stark reminder of the legal framework\nwithin which we must operate. Yet, they do not dictate the spirit of our interactions. We have the power to define this process, to\nchoose dialogue over discord, and to ensure that our daughters witness an example of maturity and compassion, even in the face of\npersonal turmoil.\n\nChoosing the path to forgiveness and understanding does not signify a loss for either of us; rather, it offers a chance for healing and\ngrowth. It allows us to close this chapter of our lives with respect for what was and optimism for what will be. It ensures that the legacy\nwe leave for our daughters is one of love, resilience, and the courage to choose peace over conflict.\n\nAs we move forward, let us do so with the intention of minimizing harm and maximizing understanding. Let's remain allies in parenting,\nunited in our desire to see our daughters thrive. This is not just about dividing assets or legal rights; it's about safeguarding the\nemotional and psychological health of our children and preserving the essence of a family transformed but still intact.\n\nMorgan, | extend this letter not just as a legal respondent but as a partner in parenting and a fellow steward of our family's future. Let\nus navigate this process with the wisdom, love, and respect that our daughters deserve, laying a foundation for a future where they\nfeel secure, loved, and valued, regardless of the challenges we face.\n\nSo with that, | formally apologize for my role in all of this. I'm truly sorry | wasn't able to handle the thought of losing you as quickly as\nyou would have liked. I'm sorry for any actions that were made out of spite or anger. I'm sorry for failing you as a husband, and making\nyou think | was motivated by anything but the love in my heart for you and our girls.\n\nWhether married or not, one thing is for certain, even after everything that has unfolded:\n\n| love you. I'm always going to love you, and I'm always going to try and do what's best for you - even while separating, whether you're\nin the same home or in another, and whether you're Miss Wilson, or Mrs. Myers.\n\nI've dropped all suits filed against you, as that decision was one based on anger and not rationale, and will end this letter being left\ncompletely vulnerable to what you decide to do with it.\n\n| hold nothing against you, as the sliver of hope my gut so strongly feels is worth listening to, because without it, there's nothing left to\nguide me.\n\n| can either stand up for our family, or myself.. but not both.. and | choose our family.\nWith all do respect,\n\nCharlie\n",

This act has severely compromised our financial stability and has directly impacted my\nprofessional obligations. It raises significant ethical and legal questions, especially since Dan is not licensed to practice law, yet he\nreferred to himself as your \u2018client\u2019. | have all of this in evidence.\n\nAdditionally, the unwarranted withdrawal of funds based on Dan's guidance, coupled with the filing of false reports, is both deceptive\nand potentially criminal. This conduct is a direct affront to the legal standards meant to govern our divorce proceedings fairly and\njustly.\n\nGiven the gravity of these actions, | am contemplating all legal avenues, which include pursuing criminal charges for the misleading\npractices and the unauthorized withdrawal of funds, and the intentional lying on sworn documents by you in an attempt to slander my\ncharacter and gain an unfair advantage in the divorce proceedings.\n\nIn light of these events, | expect the following corrective measures to be taken immediately:\nWithdrawal of the Protective Order:\n\nThe false and misleading protective order alleging family violence must be retracted. The claims are without merit and have imposed\nunnecessary restrictions, directly affecting my ability to be present for our children - a stark contradiction to the divorce petition request\nfor joint conservatorship.\n\nResolution of the Unlawful Eviction:\n\n| ask that you discuss with your grandmother the withdrawal of the illegal eviction notice. Divorce is not a lawful cause for eviction, and\ninvoking the protective order, which is still under judicial review, is inappropriate and misleading, as well as unlawful. If granted - it\nwould be next to impossible to secure housing - which is not in the best interest for our children.\n\nFull Disclosure of Financial Activities:\n\nYou must provide a detailed explanation for the withdrawal of funds into your \"personal account,\" especially in light of your claim of\nfinancial inability to pay for your divorce petition. As we are still under the regime of community property, transparency in our financial\ndealings is paramount.\n\nHalt to Divorce Proceedings Discussion:\n\nUntil these critical issues are resolved and all false statements are rectified, discussions around the divorce proceedings are to be\npaused. The foundation of our negotiations must be built on honesty and factual accuracy.\n\nStart thinking about the children:\n\nNone of your actions have been what's best for the children - but rather a calculated series of steps to run away from accountability,\nand a joint effort by you and other members of your family to up-root our financial stability and living arrangements - something that\nwould be detrimental to our children as you have no means to provide, and all important and relevant questions have been asked by\nme - with little to no communication on your end.\n\nThe recent decisions you have made, in collaboration with certain family members, are not only deeply concerning but also seem to\nbe a deliberate effort to destabilize our family\u2019s financial security and living conditions. Such actions are not only reckless but also\nshow a lack of consideration for the long-term impact on our children's lives.\n\nYour refusal to engage in meaningful communication has only compounded these issues. Essential questions concerning our\nchildren's future, their well-being, and how we plan to co-parent under these new circumstances have been met with silence or\ninsufficient responses from your end. This lack of communication is not only unhelpful but also exacerbates the already challenging\nsituation we find ourselves in.\n\n| implore you to reconsider the trajectory of your actions. Our children deserve a stable, secure, and nurturing environment, and your\ncurrent approach risks depriving them of this. | am prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure their well-being is\nprioritized and safeguarded.\n\nMorgan, it is within your power to rectify these matters, and | urge you to do so promptly. Should these issues remain unaddressed, |\nam prepared to defend my rights vigorously and demonstrate the falsity of the claims against me while substantiating my assertions.\n",

The protective order, based on allegations that lack substantiation, not only contradicts the initial grounds of our divorce but\nalso unfairly tarnishes my reputation and has serious implications for our family's future. Utilizing such a measure as leverage in our\ndivorce proceedings is neither just nor lawful.\n\nRegarding the financial aspects, | am committed to providing all necessary information in a transparent manner. However, this process\nmust be reciprocal to ensure fairness and equity. The detailed disclosure of financial information, including account numbers,\nbalances, IRA accounts, brokerage, and retirement accounts, and the tax identification number of my company, will be conducted in a\nmanner that reflects our mutual responsibilities and rights.\n\nConcerning the living arrangements, your insistence on me vacating our family home at 6641 Anne Ct Watauga. TX 76148, without a\nsolid, mutually agreed-upon plan, is not reasonable. Decisions regarding our living situation must be made with careful consideration\nof our daughters\u2019 stability and well-being. Unilaterally dictating terms is not conducive to a constructive resolution.\n\nThe involvement of third parties, particularly the actions of Dan and your grandmother, raises serious legal and ethical concerns. Their\nattempts to influence the case through means such as unlawful eviction notices and financial manipulations are unacceptable and\npotentially violate legal boundaries. If it is discovered that you falsified the documents on the advice of Dan - and it is found that he\nhas no license to practice law - this is a serious matter that | will pursue legally.\n\nYour assistance in this proceeding has done nothing but convolute the case - as they are operating off of a one sided narrative\noperating off of non-facts.\n\n| must stress that until these unlawful acts are addressed and rectified, proceeding with any divorce negotiations seems impractical\nand unwise. The use of an unlawful eviction notice and a baseless protective order as leverage in our divorce is a strategy | cannot\ncondone or participate in. These issues highlight the necessity of resolving our situation through the court, where objective and lawful\ndecisions can be made.\n\n| understand your desire to no longer live with me - however - this does not give you the right to use your family to meddle in our\nbusiness without knowing the fact, and also does not give your grandmother the right to unlawfully pursue eviction based on\nconcurrent proceedings.\n\nYou will not use your illegal and unlawful attempts of removing me from the family home as leverage.\n\nThis is not only unethical, but shows a clear lack of commitment by you to resolve these issues in a manner that best suits our\nchildren.\n\nUntil the following tasks are completed, | have no incentive to cooperate with you considering the nature of your false allegations and\nunreasonable expectations as well as disregard for the law and due process.\n\n1. Movement of Funds by Dan's Advice:\nThe evidence at hand indicates that Dan, despite lacking legal standing to practice law in Texas, advised you to withdraw funds from\nour joint account. This action not only caused significant financial strain but also constitutes unauthorized legal practice. The text\n\nmessages corroborating this advice point to a clear violation of legal and ethical boundaries. This move, which resulted in an overdraft\nand unpaid bills, is not just morally reprehensible but also illegal.\n\n2. Use of Unlawful Eviction as Leverage:\nThe eviction notice served, which cites our divorce and a protective order as reasons, is legally unfounded. An eviction based on\n\nthese grounds does not comply with Texas property and family law. Utilizing this as a tactic in our divorce is an abuse of legal\nprocesses and constitutes a serious legal infraction.\n\n2 Racalacec Pratartive Ordar:\n",

This action not\nonly affects my personal and professional reputation but also misrepresents the truth in a legal setting. It is imperative to understand\nthat such allegations, when proven false, can lead to legal repercussions for the accuser.\n\nIt is important to recognize that these actions have serious legal consequences. If these issues are not addressed and the unlawful\nacts are not withdrawn, they will become central to our legal proceedings. This situation could lead to accountability measures,\nincluding potential legal action against those who have committed these unlawful acts.\n\n| urge you to consider the gravity of the situation and the impact of these actions on our family, especially our daughters. It is essential\nto approach our divorce with honesty, fairness, and respect for the legal process. | remain committed to resolving our issues amicably\nand lawfully, but this requires a mutual effort to rectify the wrongs that have been done.\n\nIn closing, | implore you to reassess your approach and engage in a resolution process that respects legal boundaries and our family's\nwell-being.\n\nWhile your claims to be civil are heard - your actions directly contradicts this - as throughout this process you have done nothing other\nthan impose hardship, mental anguish, and not communicate on important matters while using your family and false allegations to\nabuse the process in your favor.\n\nA resolution is not possible outside of the courts until you can resolve these serious legal concerns.\nRespectfully,\n\nCharlie\n\nOn Fri, Jan 5, 2024, 3:59 PM Morgan Myers <morganmw\nCharlie,\n\n@gmail.com> wrote:\n\nOn December 1, 2023, | made you aware that | no longer wanted to be together, and that | wanted a divorce. From that moment,\nand since then, | have asked for our time with the girls to be shared as evenly as possible. | have mentioned multiple times that | am\nnot going into this with the intentions of taking the girls away from you or demanding maximum child/spousal support. There was\nalso a mutual agreement at the beginning of December that you would be moving out of the house after the holidays. Each attempt\nI've made to speak to you in more detail about these matters has been met with hostility or bringing up past, personal issues, which\nhalt all further conversation.\n\nThe attempts by you to handle this amicably that you claim to have made were simply you making demands that | withdraw\neverything I've filed so we can start again on your terms. You've even gone as far as to say that you will deny my attempt to\nwithdraw the protective order, which directly contradicts this latest email from you. This has been the pattern since the moment |\nasked for divorce, which has made this entire process very difficult to navigate. If you are truly willing to have a civil conversation\nabout moving forward, | am open and willing to sit down with you. If that's the case, | request that your attorney (or witness of your\nchoice) join along with a witness that | choose. Otherwise, I'd like all communication about our divorce be done via email. During\nthis conversation, we need to discuss the following topics:\n\nCustody Agreements\n\nAs I've mentioned, | do not want to keep you out of Mara and Caroline's life. You are their father, and have been a very good father\nto them. | don't want to jeopardize their relationship with you. That being said, | believe it is in the best interest for them that we split\nour time evenly. For easy filing with the court, | suggest we go by the state of Texas' standard. Of course, we can make our own\narrangements outside of this and use the standard as a fall back should any problems or concerns with each other. As the parent\nlisted first to contact in an emergency at school, and as the parent that takes them to scheduled and urgent doctor appointments, |\nwould see it fitting to have myself listed at the primary parent. This is the state standard visitation:\n\nStandard Child Visitation Schedule in TX\n\nUnder a standard possession order in Texas, if the parents live less than 100 miles apart, then the parent with whom the\nchild(ren) do not primarily live (Charlie) typically has possession of the children on the first, third, and fifth weekends of the\nmonth, beginning on Friday at either the time school lets out or 6:00 p.m. and ending on Sunday at 6:00 p.m.\n\nThe non-custodial parent will also have child visitation every Thursday, beginning at either the time that school lets out or\n6:00 p.m. and ending at 8:00 p.m.\n\nIf the parents reside more than 100 miles apart, then the non-custodial parent has the choice between the first, third, and\nfifth weekends of the month or one weekend per month.\n\nSummer Visitation in TX\n",

The\nparent must give notice of their 42 days (which can be broken up into two periods of possession) by April 1st, or it will\nautomatically default to June 15th through July 27th.\n\nThe primary parent then has the option of having two non-consecutive weekend visitations during the 42 days if they\nprovide notice by April 15th.\n\nHoliday Visitation Schedules\n\nHolidays are divided between the parents on an even/odd year basis. One parent will have Thanksgiving in even years\nand the other will have Christmas in even years, and then the parents switch for odd years. Holidays typically only cover\nThanksgiving, Christmas, and spring break, but provisions can be included for every holiday.\n\nIf the parents reside less than 100 miles apart, then the parents typically rotate spring break on an even/odd basis. If the\nparents reside over 100 miles apart, the parent who does not have primary possession is awarded spring break every\nyear.\n\nIf there is anything further you wish to discuss regarding custody agreements, please let me know.\n\nFinancial Obligations\n| will not walk into any discussion or court proceedings asking a judge to grant me the maximum available child or spousal support.\n\nIf the court decides that child support be paid, | will leave it to their discretion to decide the amount. | have multiple applications out\nfor full-time positions, and have received an offer for a job to begin training on January 22, 2024. | will not ask you to cover bills for\nthe house once we are no longer living together. | would request that assets | am unaware of be split, or at least some percentage\nbe granted to me to ensure our children are provided for. Below is the standard child support for Texas. Again, | will not make any\nspecific demands for support. It will be entirely up to the court.\n\nChild Support\n\nTexas standard- Texas child support laws provide the following Guideline calculations: one child= 20% of Net Monthly\nIncome ; two children = 25% of Net Monthly Income. Texas law provides that in order to compute net monthly income, the\ncourt should first calculate gross income on an annual basis and then recalculate to determine the average monthly gross\nincome, meaning the court will divide the annual net income/resources by 12 to come up with monthly net resources.\n\nIn determining gross income, the court will calculate net resources. Resources include: all wages and salary, interests,\ndividends, royalty income, self-employment income, net rental income, all other income actually being received, including\nseverance, retirement, pensions, social security, unemployment, disability and workers\u2019 compensation among numerous\nother income categories.\n\nThe court will then deduct the following: social security taxes; federal income tax; state income tax; union dues; health\ninsurance for the child.\n\nIn regards to the $1,576 | transferred from the PNC account, | am willing to provide my bank statement showing the money entering\nmy account, and what it has been used for since then. | can send those in a separate email once | get that prepared. In exchange, |\nkindly request the provision of comprehensive financial documentation, specifically copies of all bank statements spanning the last\nthree years. | will require detailed information encompassing account numbers and balances for all financial accounts, inclusive of\nbut not limited to, the IRA account with a reported balance of $38,000. Furthermore, please provide details on any brokerage\naccounts, company checking accounts, 401k or other retirement accounts, and all credit cards associated with your financial\nportfolio. Additionally, | request disclosure of your company's tax identification number and any accounts associated with your\nprofessional activities.\n\nMoreover, | seek pertinent contact information for the entities with which you have indicated collaboration in London and Germany.\nAs per your earlier reference to an upcoming business trip in January 2024 for the purpose of \"closing a deal worth $10,000 a\nmonth,\" | would appreciate details on the companies involved to facilitate further communication and verification.\n\nIf there is anything further you wish to discuss regarding finances, please let me know.\n\nLiving Arrangements\n\nThroughout your voice messages, texts, emails, and filings you've made, it is clear that you now have no intention of leaving, even\nafter our divorce is final. | feel that | need to make this clear - | do not want to continue living together.

This communication is\nnot just about us but primarily about our children and their future. We are at a crucial point where our decisions will have long-\nlasting effects. | implore you to consider the following detailed reasons for filing a joint motion to dismiss and re-evaluating our\nsituation collaboratively:\n\nConservatorship Contradiction:\n\nOur mutual request for joint conservatorship is in stark contradiction with the protective order you've filed against me. This order,\nbased on unfounded claims, directly conflicts with the idea of shared parenting responsibilities. Pursuing this in court will\ninevitably bring these contradictions to light, potentially undermining both our cases.\n\nQuestionable Eviction Process:\n\nThe eviction proceedings initiated by your grandmother, coupled with the subsequent voiding of the eviction notice, exhibit a lack\nof due diligence and responsibility. If scrutinized in court, this could reflect poorly on the integrity of your claims and question the\nmotivations behind them.\n\nDan\u2019s Financial Intrusion:\n\nDan\u2019s involvement in our financial matters has not only created undue strain but also sets a precedent for external interference in\nour private affairs. The discovery process in court will uncover all relevant financial transactions and communications, likely\nbringing unwelcome scrutiny and consequences.\n\nImplications of a Conspiracy:\n\nThe collective actions of your party paint a disturbing picture of a concerted effort to damage my credibility with baseless\nallegations of family violence.

Different actions\u2014\nranging from financial misdeeds to dishonesty and neglect\u2014carry specific legal\nconsequences under Texas law. Below is an analysis of each listed action, including relevant\nstatutes/case law, potential penalties, real-case examples, and the impact on divorce\noutcomes (property division, child custody, and financial orders).\n\n1. Lying on an Affidavit of Inability to Pay Court Fees\n\nRelevant Law: Filing a \u201cStatement of Inability to Afford Court Costs\u201d (pauper\u2019s affidavit)\nin Texas requires a declaration under penalty of perjury that the information is true.\nKnowingly lying on such an affidavit is perjury under Texas Penal Code \u00a737.02.\n\nBecause this affidavit is submitted in a court proceeding, a false material statement may\nqualify as aggravated perjury (Texas Penal Code \u00a737.03)\n\nTexas courts explicitly warn that making false statements \u201cunder penalty of perjury\u201d in a\nfee-waiver affidavit can lead to criminal prosecution\nCriminal/Civil Penalties: Perjury in Texas is a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by up to 1\n\nyear in county jail and a $4,000 fine.\n\nIf the false statement is made in connection with an official proceeding (like a court case)\n",

      "text": "and is material, it constitutes aggravated perjury, a third-degree felony carrying 2-10 years\nin prison and up to a $10,000 fine.\n\nIn addition to criminal liability, a person caught lying on a court-cost affidavit will likely\nlose the fee waiver \u2014 the court can require them to pay the fees and may sanction the deceit.\nWhile not common, judges can refer the matter to the district attorney; Texas judges take\nperjury seriously and have, in extreme instances, ordered a lying party to be immediately\nescorted for booking on perjury charges.\n\nEnforcement Examples: There are few reported cases purely about false indigence\naffidavits, but perjury prosecutions do occur. For example, Tarrant County prosecutors have\ncharged individuals with aggravated perjury months after investigating false statements in\ncourt proceedings\n\nThe affidavit form itself cautions that false statements can be prosecuted., underscoring that\nauthorities view this as a crime. Even if criminal charges are not pursued, courts can impose\nconsequences within the divorce case: a judge may revoke any temporary relief granted\nbased on the false affidavit and could order the lying party to pay the other side\u2019s attorney\u2019s\nfees incurred due to the misconduct.\n\nImpact on Divorce Outcome: Being caught in a lie to the court severely undermines a\nlitigant\u2019s credibility. In a divorce, credibility is crucial when proving income, assets, or\nfitness as a parent. A spouse who lies about their inability to pay fees may be presumed to\nbe dishonest in other testimony, harming their case. For instance, if one party lied about\nfinances to avoid court fees, a judge might doubt their disclosures about marital assets or\nincome. This could lead to stricter scrutiny of their financial claims and potentially a less\nfavorable property division for the dishonest party. In custody matters, while lying about\ncourt fees isn\u2019t directly about the children, it reflects on the person\u2019s integrity; a judge could\nquestion that party\u2019s honesty in child-related testimony. Overall, such a lie may not carry a\nspecific family-law penalty beyond loss of the fee waiver, but it poisons the court\u2019s trust,\nwhich can influence every aspect of the divorce judgment.\n\n2. Theft of Marital Funds\n\nRelevant Law: In Texas, money or property acquired during marriage is generally\ncommunity property belonging to both spouses. Each spouse owes a fiduciary duty to the\nother in managing community assets.\n\nIf one spouse wrongfully takes, conceals, or spends marital funds for their sole benefit\nwithout the other\u2019s consent, it may be treated as fraud on the community (also called waste\nor dissipation of assets). Texas Family Code \u00a77.009 provides that if a spouse is found to\nhave committed actual or constructive fraud on the community, the court must calculate the\nvalue of the misappropriated funds and reconstitute the community estate, then divide it in a\n\u201cjust and right\u201d manner.\n\nIn practice, this means the wronged spouse can receive a greater share of the remaining\n\nce a . 4 C 1 m~ a\n",

      "text": "community property or a money juagment to compensate ror the stolen Tunas. Un tne\ncriminal side, outright theft by a spouse can fall under general theft laws. Texas Penal Code\n\u00a731.03 defines theft as unlawfully appropriating property with intent to deprive the owner of\nit. A spouse taking funds belonging to the other spouse\u2019s separate property, or by fraud (for\nexample, forging the spouse\u2019s signature to withdraw money), could be charged with theft or\nfraud.\n\nPotential Penalties:\n\ne Civil/Divorce Penalties: The primary remedy in a divorce for \u201ctheft\u201d of community\nfunds is an unequal property division. Courts can award the innocent spouse a\ndisproportionate share of the community estate or a money judgment to make up\nfor the loss.\n\nIn extreme cases, judges have effectively awarded 100% of certain assets to the\ninnocent spouse when the other dissipated or hid funds. For example, in Boothe v.\nBoothe (Tex. App. 2023), the trial court found the wife had committed fraud and\nwaste of community assets (including stealing the husband\u2019s checkbooks and\nmisusing funds); the court responded by awarding the husband virtually the entire\ncommunity estate (the wife received only her personal clothing).\n\nLikewise, if one spouse diverted community money for an affair or personal use, the\nspent sums can be counted against that spouse in the division. Texas law permits\njudges to \u201creconstitute\u201d the estate by adding back the value of misused funds, then\naward a larger portion of what remains (or a cash judgment) to the wronged spouse.\nThe divorce court may also order the guilty spouse to pay the other\u2019s attorney fees as\na form of sanction.\n\ne Criminal Penalties: While spouses have joint interests in community property,\negregious misappropriation can lead to criminal charges in some instances. Theft\noffenses in Texas range from misdemeanors to felonies depending on the value stolen.\nFor instance, unlawfully taking a large sum (over $30,000) could be a felony theft\ncharge, with penalties escalating as the amount increases. If a spouse steals from the\nother\u2019s separate property (say, empties an inheritance account), that clearly falls\nwithin theft law. Penalties could include restitution, fines, and incarceration (e.g., theft\nof $2,500\u2014$30,000 is a state jail felony; larger amounts can be third, second, or first-\ndegree felonies under Texas Penal Code \u00a731.03). Additionally, if a spouse violates a\ncourt\u2019s temporary restraining order by transferring or hiding marital funds during a\ndivorce, they can be held in contempt of court (punishable by fines or jail time) in\nthe civil case. Contempt sanctions often compel the return of funds or incarceration\nuntil compliance.\n\nEnforcement/Case Examples: Texas courts take a dim view of spouses hiding or stealing\nassets. Spouses have been found to commit fraud on the community for secretly transferring\nfunds to third parties or dissipating accounts. In Schlueter v. Schlueter, the Texas Supreme\nCourt noted that a wronged spouse has an adequate remedy through an unequal property\ndivision, rather than a separate tort suit, when the other spouse misappropriates assets\n\nws ra . 1 ~ 3 og aa \u00b0 # \u00ae 1 \u2018 \u201c?>~ -\" a 1 v.41 a2 Ose\n",

Criminal prosecution of a spouse for asset theft is\nless common but not impossible. For example, if a husband secretly siphoned funds into a\npersonal account and forged documents, he could face charges for forgery, fraud, or theft.\nThere have been cases outside of divorce (e.g. a former spouse prosecuted for forging\nchecks on an ex-spouse\u2019s account), illustrating that marital status is not a defense to theft.\nMoreover, misusing a child\u2019s trust fund or support payments (such as falsely claiming a\ndisability for a child to collect support, as in Boothe, can lead not only to civil remedies but\npotentially to criminal fraud charges.\n\nImpact on Divorce Settlements, Custody, and Finances: Theft or dissipation of marital\nfunds primarily affects the property settlement. Texas is a community property state, and\nby statute the division must be \u201cjust and right\u201d (Tex. Fam. Code \u00a77.001). A spouse who has\nstolen or hidden funds will likely receive a smaller portion of the remaining assets as the\ncourt\u2019s way of balancing the equities.\n\nThe innocent spouse may recoup the value of missing funds through a greater share of\nproperty or a judgment. This can significantly alter the financial outcome; instead of, say, a\n50/50 split, the innocent spouse might get 60, 70, or even 100% of certain assets to offset\nthe loss. Such misconduct can also influence spousal maintenance or alimony decisions \u2014 a\njudge may be more inclined to order the offending spouse to pay maintenance if their\nwrongdoing worsened the other\u2019s financial position, or conversely may deny an offending\nspouse any support. In terms of child custody, misuse of funds typically does not directly\ndetermine conservatorship or visitation rights. However, if the theft involved funds meant\nfor the children\u2019s care (for example, spending the child\u2019s college fund or support money), it\ncould reflect on that parent\u2019s judgment and priorities. Courts primarily base custody on the\nchild\u2019s best interest (Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7153.002);so a parent who shows a pattern of\ndishonesty or financially endangering the family might be seen as less reliable. Still, absent\na connection to the child\u2019s welfare, financial theft is more likely to impact the financial\norders (property division, child support calculations) than custody arrangements. Finally, if a\nspouse\u2019s theft of funds is part of adulterous behavior (gifts to a paramour, etc.), it overlaps\nwith adultery as a fault ground and can compound the fault-based property award to the\nother spouse.\n\n3. Engaging in a Long-Term Affair (Adultery) and Its\nImpact on Divorce\n\nRelevant Law: Adultery itself is not a crime in Texas, but it is recognized as marital\nmisconduct with legal consequences in divorce. Texas Family Code \u00a76.003 explicitly lists\nadultery as a fault ground for divorce: \u201cThe court may grant a divorce in favor of one\nspouse if the other spouse has committed adultery.\u201d\n",

      "text": "In addition, even in a no-fault divorce, courts may consider adultery when dividing property\nor deciding on spousal support. Texas law requires a \u201cjust and right\u201d division of community\nproperty at divorce (Tex. Fam. Code \u00a77.001), and the Texas Supreme Court has held that\nfault in the breakup of the marriage \u2014 including adultery \u2014 may be weighed by the court in\nmaking an unequal division.\n\nFor example, in Murff v. Murff, the Court affirmed that a trial judge has broad discretion to\nconsider a spouse\u2019s adultery (among other factors) in allocating a greater share of the estate\nto the innocent spouse.\n\nLikewise, Texas Family Code \u00a78.052(10) includes \u201cmarital misconduct, including adultery\u201d\nas a factor in determining spousal maintenance (alimony) awards.\n\nIn short, while an affair does not expose one to criminal charges, it can be legally relevant to\ndivorce outcomes.\n\nPotential Consequences in the Divorce:\n\ne Property Division: Adultery can financially cost the unfaithful spouse. Judges in\nTexas have discretion to award a disproportionate share of community property to the\nspouse who was cheated on, as part of a fault-based division. It is not automatic that\nadultery will result in an unequal split, but if the innocent spouse can show the affair\ncontributed to the marriage\u2019s breakdown or involved misuse of marital assets, courts\noften adjust the division. For instance, one family law court noted that a judge might\naward 60% of the community estate to the faithful spouse and 40% to the\nadulterous spouse when adultery is proven.\n\nThe rationale is that the adulterer\u2019s conduct breached the marriage and perhaps\neconomic security of the family, justifying a larger award to the other side.\nAdditionally, if the cheating spouse spent significant community funds on the affair\n(gifts, trips, etc.), the court can count those expenditures as a depletion of the\ncommunity estate (a form of constructive fraud/waste). The judge might \u201crecoup\u201d that\nby granting the wronged spouse an equivalent amount in extra property.\n\ne Spousal Maintenance (Alimony): Adultery can influence post-divorce support. Texas\nis conservative about alimony, but when a spouse does qualify for maintenance under\nChapter 8 of the Family Code, the court \u201cmust consider all relevant factors,\u201d\nincluding either spouse\u2019s adultery. This means a cheating spouse asking for\nmaintenance is less likely to receive it (the court may view their misconduct as a\nreason to deny or limit support), whereas a cheated-on spouse may have a stronger\nclaim for support if needed. While Texas law does not allow punitive alimony, judges\nmay, for example, lean toward the upper end of the allowed duration or amount for a\nspouse who was faithful when the other\u2019s affair caused financial or emotional harm.\nConversely, a spouse who committed adultery might be ordered to pay contractual\nalimony or a larger lump-sum as part of the divorce settlement to the other spouse\n(this often happens in negotiated settlements, using the fault as leverage). It\u2019s\nimnortant to note that adulterv alone doesn\u2019t ouarantee alimonv\u2014there must still he\n",

Code \u00a78.051 (such as a marriage 10+ years with a spouse\nlacking ability to meet minimum needs, etc.), but once eligibility is met, adultery can\ntilt the scale on the award.\n\ne Child Custody: By itself, a parent\u2019s extramarital affair is usually not a decisive factor\nin child custody or visitation determinations. Texas law mandates that custody\n(conservatorship) decisions be made in the \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d (Tex. Fam.\nCode \u00a7153.002)\n\ncodes.findlaw.com\n\n. Ordinarily, an affair is an issue between the spouses and does not mean the cheating\nparent is unfit to raise the child. Texas courts have generally held that \u201ca parent's\nadultery won t affect a judges decision about parenting time\u201d unless the affair\nnegatively impacted the children.\n\n. For example, if the cheating parent exposed the children to inappropriate situations\n(such as involving them in meetings with the lover), neglected the children to carry\non the affair, or if the affair partner poses a risk to the kids, then it becomes relevant.\nIn such cases, a court could consider the moral environment or safety: perhaps\nordering that the lover not be present during the parent\u2019s visitation, or in extreme\nsituations, the affair could contribute to a finding that the parent put their needs\nabove the child\u2019s. However, absent evidence that the affair harmed the child\u2019s well-\nbeing, adultery typically will not change conservatorship. Texas case law reflects\nthat a parent\u2019s sexual misconduct is only one factor and is outweighed by direct\nfactors affecting the child. In sum, a long-term affair may influence custody only\nindirectly \u2014 for instance, if it caused instability or conflict that affected the children,\nthe judge will factor that into the best-interest analysis. (As one attorney notes,\nadultery \u201ccould be a factor in deciding who gets custody of the children\u201d only in\nlimited circumstances.\n\ne It\u2019s more common that adultery affects property and finances rather than custody.\n\ne Other Effects: While not a legal \u201cpenalty,\u201d an affair often heightens the acrimony in a\ncase, which can influence the divorce process. A spouse suing on grounds of adultery\nmight also seek reimbursement for community funds spent on the affair (as\nmentioned) or use the affair as leverage to negotiate a favorable settlement.\nAdditionally, an affair can bar the adulterer from receiving certain benefits in the\ndivorce. For example, Texas law bars a spouse from receiving court-ordered spousal\nmaintenance if they committed adultery and that is the sole ground for divorce (Tex.\nFam. Code \u00a78.053(b)), meaning a cheating spouse cannot get maintenance when the\ndivorce is granted for adultery. And while rare, adultery can form part of an\nintentional infliction of emotional distress claim in Texas (see 7wyman v. Twyman),\nbut such tort claims are hard to win and usually must be brought within the divorce\ncase, not separately.\n\nEnforcement/Precedent: Texas courts routinely acknowledge adultery in their rulings.\nFault-based divorces (while less common than no-fault) are still sought by spouses wronged\nby infidelity in order to obtain a more favorable outcome.

In another case,\nevidence showed the husband\u2019s adultery and lavish spending on his girlfriend; the appellate\ncourt approved an unequal division plus a monetary judgment to the wife to compensate for\nthose expenditures (treating them as fraud on the community). These cases demonstrate that\njudges will enforce consequences for adultery primarily through economic means. Adultery\nis also often pleaded alongside other fault grounds (like cruelty), and the cumulative\nmisconduct can strengthen the innocent spouse\u2019s position. Importantly, because adultery is\nnot a crime, there are no direct criminal cases on point, but its impact is well documented in\ncivil divorce jurisprudence. The bottom line: a long-term affair can significantly affect the\ndivorce settlement \u2014 typically harming the cheating spouse\u2019s financial interests \u2014 even\nthough it does not result in criminal penalties.\n\n4. Neglecting to Obtain Medical Care for Children\n\nRelevant Law: Parents in Texas have a legal duty to provide necessary medical care for\ntheir children. Failing to seek or provide medical care can be considered child neglect under\nTexas law. Texas Family Code \u00a7261.001(4) defines \u201cneglect\u201d to include \u201cfailing to seek,\nobtain, or follow through with medical care for a child, with the failure resulting in or\npresenting an immediate danger of death, disfigurement, or bodily injury or...an observable\nand material impairment to the child's growth, development, or functioning. \u201d.\n\nIn other words, if a parent\u2019s omission in getting medical treatment puts the child at risk of\nserious harm, it meets the statutory definition of abuse/neglect, triggering intervention by\nChild Protective Services (CPS). From a criminal standpoint, such conduct can violate\nTexas Penal Code provisions on endangering a child. For example, Texas Penal Code\n\u00a722.041(c) makes it an offense if a person \u201cby act or omission, engages in conduct that\nplaces a child in imminent danger of death, bodily injury, or physical or mental\nimpairment. \u201d\n\nFailing to obtain urgent medical care (by omission) could fall under this if the child was\nplaced in imminent danger. Additionally, Penal Code \u00a722.04 (Injury to a Child) can be\nimplicated if the lack of medical care causes serious injury to the child; a parent can be\ncriminally liable by omission if they had a legal duty to act.\n\nPotential Penalties:\n\ne Child Welfare Consequences: If a parent neglects a child\u2019s medical needs, CPS can\ninvestigate under Chapter 261 of the Family Code. Substantiated medical neglect can\nlead to various outcomes: the court might issue orders for the parent to comply with\nmedical directives, or in severe cases the child can be removed from that parent\u2019s\ncustody. A family court may place the child with the other parent or even a\nrelative/foster care if both parents were neglectful. Ultimately, if the neglect is\nextreme and persistent, it can be grounds for termination of parental rights. Texas\nFamily Code \u00a7161.001(b)(1)(D) and (E) allow termination if a parent knowingly\n\nnlaced ar allawed the child ta remain in canditinns that endanger the child\u2019s nhwvsical\n",

Failing to provide needed medical care falls squarely within \u201cendangering\nconduct\u201d when it jeopardizes the child\u2019s health. Termination is a last resort, but lesser\ncourt actions (like temporary removal or court-ordered service plans) are common to\naddress medical neglect. In private divorce litigation, one parent might file an\nemergency motion or request a modification of custody if the other parent\u2019s medical\nneglect is endangering the child. Courts can issue temporary restraining orders\nrequiring a parent to obtain specified treatment for the child.\n\nCriminal Penalties: Child neglect itself is handled through CPS/family courts, but\nwhen it crosses into criminal behavior, charges can ensue. Under Penal Code \u00a722.041\n(Child endangerment), if a parent\u2019s failure to get medical care was intentional,\nknowing, reckless, or criminally negligent and placed the child in imminent danger,\nit\u2019s a state jail felony (or higher, depending on circumstances). For example, a parent\nwho ignores a child\u2019s serious illness until the child is in life-threatening condition\ncould be prosecuted for endangerment. If the child actually suffers serious bodily\ninjury due to lack of care, the parent could be charged under Penal Code \u00a722.04\n(Injury to a Child), which ranges from a state jail felony up to a first-degree felony\ndepending on the level of injury and the parent\u2019s mental state. (Injury causing serious\nbodily harm by omission, if done knowingly or intentionally, is typically a first-degree\nfelony.) These are heavy criminal penalties \u2014 e.g., a first-degree felony can mean 5 to\n99 years in prison. There is also a specific provision that a person who has legal duty\nto a child and causes injury by failing to act can be held responsible. While\nprosecution is relatively rare (authorities often prefer to handle through CPS unless a\nchild is gravely harmed), it does happen in severe neglect cases. A notable example is\nwhen parents refuse life-saving treatment for a child for non-legitimate reasons; Texas\ncourts have seen cases where parents were charged after a child died from untreated\nillnesses (such as diabetes) that would likely have been manageable with proper\nmedical attention.\n\nDivorce/Custody Orders: In a divorce context (civil court), a parent\u2019s medical neglect\nof a child will manifest in custody outcomes. The court can issue orders restricting\nthat parent\u2019s rights. For instance, the court might award sole managing\nconservatorship to the other parent, meaning the responsible parent gets the\nexclusive right to make medical decisions for the child. The neglectful parent could be\nmade possessory conservator with limited rights or supervised visitation. Texas\nFamily Code \u00a7153.002 states the child\u2019s best interest is paramount; a demonstrated\npattern of not obtaining necessary medical care strongly indicates that giving that\nparent decision-making or primary custody is not in the child\u2019s best interest. Thus, the\nneglectful parent is likely to lose decision-making authority over health matters at\nminimum. The court may also order that parent to attend parenting classes or\nmedical education as a condition of access to the child. If the issue is serious, the\ncourt could require their visits with the child to be supervised by a third party or\ncontingent on proof that they will follow medical instructions (for example,\nadministering prescribed medication during their visitation). The neglectful parent\nmight also be ordered to pay for any medical expenses that resulted from the lack of\ncare (for example, if their neglect caused the child\u2019s condition to worsen and incur\n",

      "text": "greater treatment Costs).\n\nImpact on Divorce Settlements, Custody, and Judgments: Neglecting a child\u2019s medical\nneeds most directly affects child custody (conservatorship) determinations. A parent who\nhas failed to provide proper medical care will likely be deemed unfit to serve as a primary\ncustodian. In practical terms, the other parent will almost certainly gain primary\nconservatorship, meaning the child will reside primarily with the responsible parent and that\nparent will have the exclusive right to make medical decisions. The neglectful parent\u2019s\nvisitation may be curtailed or supervised to ensure the child\u2019s safety. Courts have a duty to\nprotect the child\u2019s welfare; thus, even if a divorce is initially filed as \u201cno-fault,\u201d evidence of\none parent\u2019s medical neglect will shift the case to focus on protecting the child. This could\nresult in emergency temporary orders during the case, giving one parent immediate custody\npending final orders. Ultimately, the possession schedule could be adjusted so that the\nneglectful parent has less time (or only daytime visits) if the court fears the child\u2019s health\nmight be compromised in their care. As for financial judgments, if one parent\u2019s neglect led\nto significant medical costs, the court may take that into account. For example, if due to\nneglect a child needed hospitalization, a judge could order the neglectful parent to cover\nthose bills or reimburse the other parent (this might be done through an unequal division of\nany remaining community property or via child support adjustments). Also, a parent who\nloses custody due to neglect will typically be ordered to pay child support to the other\nparent, which ensures the custodial parent can better provide for the child\u2019s needs (including\nmedical care). In extreme scenarios where parental rights are terminated for neglect, the\nparent would no longer have custody or visitation and would also lose standing to claim any\nrights in the divorce regarding the child (though they may still be ordered to pay past due\nsupport or certain costs). Regarding the divorce settlement (property division), child-\nrelated misconduct isn\u2019t a listed factor for property splits as adultery or fraud is. However, if\nthe neglect caused economic loss (like medical expenses), the court could indirectly address\nit. For instance, the court might decide not to award a neglectful parent a house or asset that\nwould otherwise have been split, in order to ensure the child\u2019s residence with the other\nparent is secure (especially if that asset is needed to raise the child). In sum, medical neglect\npredominantly affects custody and parental rights rather than serving as a monetary\npenalty, but it can have financial implications insofar as ensuring resources for the child\u2019s\ncare are allocated to the responsible parent.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s worth noting that Texas law does have a narrow exception for certain cases of\nmedical decisions: if a parent withholds specific treatment due to a legitimately held\nreligious belief, CPS may not consider it neglect in some circumstances (unless the child\u2019s\nlife is in danger). But in a divorce, a secular court will still put the child\u2019s health first. As\none Texas attorney put it, \u201cNeg/ecting a child's medical needs certainly could be a basis for\na custody change\u201d.\n\n\u2014 divorce courts will act accordingly to protect the child.\n\n5. Perjury in Court Proceedings\n\nRelevant Law: Perjury is lying under oath, and doing so during court proceedings is\nespecially serious.

Thus, a\nspouse or witness who commits perjury in a divorce court (or in filings/depositions\nconnected to the case) could be charged with aggravated perjury. To be \u201cmaterial,\u201d the false\nstatement must be capable of affecting the outcome; trivial lies may not meet that threshold,\nbut most false statements on substantive issues in divorce (property values, fitness of a\nparent, etc.) are material. Notably, even if not prosecuted, lying in court violates court rules\nand can lead the judge to impose sanctions or hold the perjurer in contempt. Moreover,\nperjury is classified as a crime of moral turpitude, reflecting on one\u2019s honesty and\npotentially impacting their credibility in legal proceedings.\n\nPenalties for Perjury: Under Texas law, perjury (not in an official proceeding) is a Class\nA misdemeanor, and aggravated perjury (in an official proceeding and material) is a third-\ndegree felony. Specifically:\n\ne Class A Misdemeanor Perjury: Punishable by up to 1 year in county jail and a fine\nup to $4,000. This could apply to false statements under oath that aren\u2019t part of a trial\n\u2014 for example, lying in a sworn affidavit attached to a motion (if not considered \u201cin\nconnection with\u201d the proceeding) or lying in a deposition about something arguably\nimmaterial. In practice, most lies in the context of a divorce case will be considered\nconnected to an official proceeding, so aggravated perjury is the typical charge.\n\ne Third-Degree Felony (Aggravated Perjury): Punishable by 2 to 10 years in state\nprison and a fine up to $10,000. This covers lying under oath in court, at a deposition,\nor in a sworn inventory or financial statement filed with the court, provided the\nfalsehood is material. Each separate materially false statement could theoretically be a\nseparate count. Besides criminal penalties, being convicted of a felony can have\ncollateral consequences like loss of certain civil rights and difficulty finding\nemployment (the stigma of a crime of moral turpitude).\n\nAdditionally, Texas judges have the power to punish contempt of court. While usually\ncontempt is for disobeying court orders, blatant lying to the judge\u2019s face can provoke an\nimmediate response. There have been instances in Texas family courts where judges, upon\ncatching someone lying on the stand, halted the proceedings and ordered the person taken\ninto custody. One law firm recounts a judge telling a witness, \u201cGet off the stand... Sheriff,\ntake him down and book him. DA, I\u2019m pressing charges for perjury.\u201d\u2019. In that scenario, the\nperson would be jailed on a contempt/perjury hold and face subsequent indictment for\naggravated perjury. Such dramatic enforcement, though not everyday, underscores that\ncourts will not tolerate perjury. Short of criminal prosecution, a judge can impose civil\nsanctions for litigation misconduct. If a party\u2019s perjury is discovered, the court may order\nthem to pay the other side\u2019s attorney fees incurred because of the lie (for example, fees for\nhaving to uncover the truth). In extreme cases, Texas courts can even strike a party\u2019s\n\n1 1 ba Ww 1 a f 1 cat * 1\n",

Texas prosecutors have charged\nindividuals for perjury in family court settings. For instance, after a high-conflict divorce\ncase in Tarrant County around 2000, two witnesses were investigated for eight months and\nthen indicted for aggravated perjury for false testimony they gave during the proceedings.\nFamily law attorneys often warn their clients that lying under oath is not only illegal but can\nbackfire disastrously. A Texas family law blog notes that if you can prove your ex lied under\noath, \u201che or she could end up paying a big price,\u201d including writing a big check (civil\ndamages) and facing prison time.\n\nOne precedent illustrating civil consequences is Glass v. Glass, 826 S.W.2d 683 (Tex. App.\n1992). In that divorce, the husband was found to have lied and obstructed discovery about\nassets; the trial court sanctioned him over $50,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees and awarded the wife a\ngreater share of property. The appellate court upheld hefty sanctions, signaling that perjury\nand discovery fraud justified harsh punishment. In Boothe v. Boothe (2023) mentioned\nearlier, the wife essentially committed perjury by making false disability claims about the\nchild in court to obtain child support. The trial court, upon learning the truth, terminated the\nimproper support and awarded the husband nearly all assets as a consequence.\n\nAlthough she wasn\u2019t criminally charged (from the record), the civil outcome was severely\nagainst her interest due to that dishonesty. Another example comes from a Dallas County\ncase (unpublished), where a father lied under oath about his income in a child support\nhearing; when the lie was uncovered through bank records, the judge not only recalculated\nsupport with the correct figures but also ordered the father to pay the mother\u2019s attorney fees\nand referred the matter to the DA\u2019s office. These examples show that perjury can lead to\nboth immediate courtroom sanctions and later legal action.\n\nImpact on the Divorce (Settlements, Custody, Financial Judgments): Committing\nperjury in a divorce case can be catastrophic to the perjurer\u2019s position. First and foremost, it\ndestroys the credibility of that party on all issues. Family law cases often hinge on he-\nsaid/she-said situations, especially in custody disputes or when valuing assets that may not\nhave perfect paper trails. If the court catches one party in a significant lie, the judge is likely\nto doubt everything that person says thereafter. This means the lying party will likely lose\ncontested issues by default of credibility. For example, if a husband lies about an asset\u2019s\nexistence and is caught, the court may well accept the wife\u2019s valuations or arguments on all\nproperty issues going forward. The perjurer may find the judge rules in favor of the other\nspouse\u2019s claims about hidden assets, debt responsibility, etc. In terms of property division,\na spouse proven to have lied about community assets or financial matters is at risk of an\nunequal division favoring the other spouse. Not only might the court give the innocent\nspouse the asset that was lied about, it could award an extra portion of other assets as a\npunitive measure or to cover the innocent spouse\u2019s litigation costs (this is within the court\u2019s\ndiscretion under the \u201cjust and right\u201d standard). The lying spouse might also face a judgment\n",

In one\nTexas case, a wife who concealed information and lied in discovery was ordered to pay over\n$100,000 of the husband\u2019s legal fees, drastically affecting her share of the marital estate (the\ncourt simply took that amount out of what she would have received). Thus, perjury can lead\nto a financial judgment against the liar.\n\nIn child custody matters, honesty is paramount because the court needs to trust a parent\u2019s\ntestimony regarding the child\u2019s welfare. If a parent is caught perjuring themselves (for\ninstance, lying about the other parent\u2019s behavior or about their own compliance with court\norders), the court may award custody to the other parent. A classic scenario is when one\nparent fabricates allegations (such as false claims of abuse by the other parent) and this is\ndisproven; family courts do not take false allegations lightly, and the parent who lied could\nnot only lose credibility but also be deemed to have endangered the child\u2019s relationship with\nthe other parent by lying. This can result in the lying parent receiving restricted visitation.\nEven in less dramatic situations, a parent who lies about, say, their drug use or income in a\ncustody hearing will likely find the court ruling against them on custody and support issues.\nThe best interest of the child standard allows the court to consider a parent\u2019s moral\ncharacter and ability to foster the child\u2019s welfare. A proven act of perjury by a parent can\nindicate poor role-model behavior and an inability to put the child\u2019s interests first (since the\nparent was willing to lie and drag the child through a contentious fight on false grounds).\nSo, perjury can indirectly but powerfully shape custody outcomes \u2014 often to the detriment of\nthe lying parent.\n\nRegarding divorce settlements, if a party is known to have lied, their bargaining power\nplummets. The other side will be less inclined to trust any settlement proposals and may\ninsist on trial or on very favorable terms. Conversely, the innocent spouse, armed with\nevidence of the other\u2019s perjury, has leverage \u2014 they could threaten to pursue criminal\ncharges or ask the court for a judgment, pushing the lying party to settle on terms favorable\nto the innocent spouse. Many divorce cases settle once one party is caught in a lie, because\nthat party wants to avoid the risk of the court\u2019s wrath (or further exposure of the lie).\n\nFinally, beyond the immediate case, perjury being a fe/ony means that if charged and\nconvicted, it could affect a spouse\u2019s future. For example, a spouse convicted of aggravated\nperjury might face difficulties in employment, might lose any professional licenses (if they\nhave a career that requires licensure and a clean record), and even immigration\nconsequences if not a citizen. While these are outside the scope of the divorce itself, they are\ncollateral fallout that can indirectly affect the family (e.g., a parent losing a medical license\ndue to a felony conviction would impact their earning capacity and thus child support, etc.).\n\nIn summary, lying under oath in a Texas divorce is exceedingly risky. The law provides\nfor severe criminal punishment, and even without a criminal case, family judges have tools\nto penalize and correct the injustice (through sanctions, property division, custody\ndecisions). As one Texas lawyer bluntly states: \u201cWhen it comes to what happens if you lie\nunder oath in family court, jail time is one of several penalties you may face\u201d, and judges\n\u201cwon t hesitate\u201d to punish or refer perjury because they will not tolerate people\nundermining the integrity of the court.\n\n& Refucina ta Pracecnte a Cacea (Kailure ta Mave RFarward\n",

In Texas civil procedure, if a case stalls due to inaction by the party who initiated\nit, the court may dismiss it for \u201cwant of prosecution.\u201d Texas Rules of Civil Procedure Rule\n165a governs Dismissal for Want of Prosecution (DWOP). Under Rule 165a, if a party\nseeking affirmative relief (like a divorce) does not appear at a hearing or does not diligently\nadvance the case, the court, after notice, must dismiss the case unless there is good cause\nshown for the delay. Courts also have an inherent power to dismiss a case that has been\ninactive for an unreasonable time. In a divorce context, this means if one spouse files for\ndivorce and then \u201crefuses\u201d or fails to take the necessary steps (serving the other spouse,\nfiling required paperwork, setting hearings, etc.), the judge can place the case on a DWOP\ndocket. Typically, the court clerk will send notice to the parties that the case will be\ndismissed on a certain date if no action is taken.\n\nEach county may have its own timeline (often if no activity for ~6 months or so, a DWOP\nnotice issues). If the parties don\u2019t respond or cannot show a good reason to keep the case\nopen, the case will be dismissed without prejudice.\n\n\u201cRefusing to prosecute\u201d could also refer to one party (say the petitioner) simply deciding not\nto show up at trial or not presenting their case. In that event, if the petitioner doesn\u2019t appear\nat trial, the court can dismiss the case at that time (again for want of prosecution).\n\nIf it\u2019s the respondent who is refusing to participate (for example, ignoring the proceedings\nentirely), the petitioner can proceed to take a default judgment after proving proper service\nand waiting the required time. So, the consequences differ depending on which side \u201crefuses\nto prosecute.\u201d Generally, the law doesn\u2019t force someone to go forward with a divorce if they\ndon\u2019t want to\u2014but it won\u2019t grant the divorce either, leaving the status quo (still married) if\nthe case is dropped.\n\nConsequences of Failure to Prosecute:\n\ne Dismissal of the Divorce: The immediate consequence is that the divorce petition will\nbe dismissed. A dismissal for want of prosecution effectively ends the case as if it\nnever happened, without a final judgment of divorce. As one attorney explained, if\nyour divorce case was DWOP\u2019'd, then \u201cyou did not get divorced.\u201d\n\navvo.com\n\nThe parties remain legally married. This can be a significant outcome\u2014if the goal\nwas to terminate the marriage, that goal is not achieved, and one would have to start\nover with a new filing (or file a motion to reinstate the case within 30 days of\ndismissal, per Rule 165a(3)). Dismissal wastes time and money that were already\ninvested in the suit. Any temporary orders that were in place during the divorce (for\nsupport, custody, etc.) expire when the case is dismissed, potentially leaving matters\nin limbo. For example, if temporary child support was being paid, that order is gone\n(since it was incident to the now-dismissed case), and the parties would have to seek\nnew orders in a new proceeding to continue enforcement.\n",

      "text": "rs ~\n\ne Delay and Added Expense: If one party refuses to move the case, it drags out the\nresolution. This could be tactical (to frustrate the other spouse or to avoid an\noutcome), but it often backfires. After dismissal, if one spouse still wants a divorce,\nthey will need to file a new petition (and pay a new filing fee, service fees, etc.).\nEssentially the process restarts. Important to note: Texas has a 60-day cooling off\nperiod from filing to divorce, so a dismissal and refiling adds at least that much delay\nagain. The time and money spent on the initial case (court costs, attorney\u2019s fees) are\nwasted. A judge can also assign court costs to the party who failed to prosecute,\nrequiring them to pay the fees for the other party\u2019s answer or any fees the county\nincurred. However, unless there was egregious bad faith, each side typically bears\ntheir own attorney\u2019s fees after a DWOP.\n\ne Sanctions for Bad Faith: \\f the refusal to prosecute is part of a pattern of stalling or\nabuse, the court might impose sanctions. For instance, if a petitioner files and\ndismisses repeatedly to harass the respondent (forcing them to prepare multiple\ntimes), a court could eventually award attorneys\u2019 fees to the respondent or even bar\nthe petitioner from refiling for some period (via an injunction against vexatious\nlitigation). Rule 13 of Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and Chapter 10 of the Civil\nPractice & Remedies Code allow sanctions for filings made in bad faith or for\npurposes of unnecessary delay. \u201cRefusing to prosecute\u201d a case might not in itself\ntrigger those unless coupled with a frivolous intent.\n\ne /mpact on Relief Sought: If the case is dismissed, obviously none of the requests in\nthe divorce (property division, custody orders, etc.) are granted. This means the\nparties revert to their pre-divorce status. This can actually benefit one party and harm\nthe other. For example, suppose Wife filed for divorce and was seeking a share of\nHusband\u2019s retirement and primary custody of the kids, but she then fails to pursue it.\nIf the case is dismissed, Wife doesn\u2019t get her share of retirement (the community\nproperty remains undivided and they\u2019re still married). On the flip side, Husband\ndoesn\u2019t get the marriage terminated either, which may or may not matter to him. If\none spouse wanted out of the marriage promptly (perhaps to remarry), a DWOP\nfrustrates that. Similarly, any progress toward agreements (say they agreed on some\nissues) is lost when the case resets.\n\nExamples: Dismissals for want of prosecution are not uncommon in Texas dockets. A party\nmight file pro se and then get overwhelmed, or couples reconcile temporarily and let the\ncase die. For instance, if a divorce case sits idle for 8-12 months with no filings, most courts\nwill send a notice like: \u201cThis case will be set on the dismissal docket on [date] unless\nsooner disposed or good cause is shown.\u201d\u2019.\n\nIf neither party appears at the DWOP hearing to show good cause, the judge will sign an\norder dismissing the case. One Texas blogger noted that DWOP is the court\u2019s way of\n\u201cmotivating the parties to keep moving toward a resolution\u201d and, failing that, \u201ca way for the\njudge to clear [inactive cases] off the docket.\u201d\u2019. On the other hand, if the respondent is the\none not participating (basically \u201crefusing to defend\u201d the case), the petitioner can get a\ndefault divorce. For example, in In re Marriage of Smith, the wife filed for divorce and the\nhusband never answered or appeared. The court allowed the wife to prove up the divorce\n",

The husband\u2019s \u201crefusal to participate\u201d meant he forfeited his say in the\noutcome. Only if he could show a good reason (like he wasn\u2019t served) could he later\nchallenge it.\n\nImpact on Divorce/Children/Finances: If one spouse\u2019s refusal to prosecute leads to a\ndismissal, the impacts are essentially the absence of a divorce decree. The parties remain\nmarried, which has several implications: (1) Marital Status and Property \u2014 Because\nthey\u2019re still married, community property continues to accrue. This could be detrimental or\nbeneficial depending on perspective. If the spouses stay separated in fact but not on paper,\nany income either earns is technically still community property; this might set up a more\ncomplicated property division whenever the divorce is re-filed, or could benefit the spouse\nwho earns less (since they\u2019d have a claim on some of the earner\u2019s ongoing income/assets).\nConversely, it could disadvantage the earner who wanted to cut off community property as\nof an earlier date. (2) Child Custody/Support \u2014 Without a divorce (or SAPCR order), there\nmay be no formal custody order or child support in effect. The parents then either continue\nany informal arrangement or one parent might file a separate Suit Affecting Parent-Child\nRelationship to get orders in place. If one parent was relying on temporary orders for\nsupport or visitation from the now-dismissed divorce, that support can stop. The children\nmight be left in an unstable situation until a case is refiled. For example, if a mother had\ntemporary primary custody and the father had visitation under temporary orders, a DWOP\nwould dissolve those orders, potentially prompting conflict or confusion about visitation\ngoing forward. Courts can preempt this by converting temporary orders into a standing order\nupon dismissal (but that requires action which typically doesn\u2019t happen automatically). (3)\nProtective Orders/Temporary Injunctions \u2014 Often in divorces there are standing mutual\ninjunctions preventing asset disposal or requiring certain bills be paid. If the divorce is\ndismissed, those injunctions end, possibly allowing a vindictive spouse to take financial\nactions (like cleaning out a bank account) unless and until a new case is filed and new\norders put in place. So a refusal to prosecute could give an opening for mischief during the\n\ngap.\n\nIf the case is refiled, the prior delays might influence the judge\u2019s view of the parties. The\nspouse who was diligent may ask the court for a swift timeline the second time around. The\njudge might also subconsciously attribute blame for the prior dismissal to the party who\ndidn\u2019t prosecute and be less sympathetic to them on contested issues. However, the merits of\nthe case (fault, property, custody) are not legally affected by a DWOP itself \u2014 those will be\ndetermined when and if the case is litigated fully.\n\nIn terms of legal strategy, if one spouse \u201crefuses to prosecute\u201d by not moving forward, the\nother spouse has options: they can file a motion to dismiss for want of prosecution\nthemselves or simply wait for the court to do it; or more proactively, the respondent spouse\ncould file a counter-petition for divorce. If a counter-petition is on file, even if the original\npetitioner drops out, the case can continue on the counter-petition. In that scenario, the\nrefusing party might actually end up as a respondent in the other\u2019s case. So one spouse\u2019s\nrefusal doesn\u2019t always halt the divorce if the other picks up the torch.\n\nTo sum up, refusing to prosecute a divorce generally results in no divorce. The legal\nconseanence is case dismissal. not nunishment. hunt it can carrv nractical nevative outcomes\n",

Courts prefer to resolve cases on the\nmerits, so a genuine lack of prosecution is met with dismissal rather than any criminal\nsanction. But if the pattern of delay is abusive, a judge can sanction the dilatory party in the\nfuture proceedings. The best practice is if a party no longer wishes to pursue divorce, they\nshould nonsuit (voluntarily dismiss) the case, rather than let it languish, so that everyone is\nclear on the status. Otherwise, a DWOP will eventually clear it off the docket, and as the\nsaying goes, \u201cyou\u2019re back to square one.\u201d\n\n7. Lying Under Oath (General Perjury in the Context of\nDivorce)\n\nThis category overlaps with item 5, but covers any instance of lying under oath, whether in\nwritten form or orally, inside or outside the courtroom. In a divorce, apart from courtroom\ntestimony, parties swear to the truth of many documents: sworn inventories of property,\nfinancial affidavits, depositions, interrogatory answers (which are given under oath), etc.\nAny deliberate falsehood in these contexts is perjury. Texas Penal Code \u00a737.02 applies\nbroadly to false sworn statements required by law.\n\nFor example, if a spouse swears in a deposition \u201cI have no other bank accounts\u201d while\nhiding an account, that is perjury. If a spouse verifies discovery responses with a notary and\nlies in those answers, that is perjury. While not all lies will be caught, the legal standard and\nconsequences remain as discussed: Class A misdemeanor or felony if in an official\nproceeding and material. The difference between item 5 and 7 is mostly one of emphasis;\nitem 5 dealt with lying in court proceedings (aggravated perjury), whereas here we note that\nany oath (even outside the courtroom) carries the same obligation of truth. Texas even has\nan Unsworn Declaration law (Civil Practice & Remedies Code Chapter 132) that allows a\nwritten declaration \u201cunder penalty of perjury\u201d instead of a notarized affidavit for certain\nfilings \u2014 a false unsworn declaration is treated as perjury as well.\n\nIn short, in the divorce process, whenever a person is \u201cunder oath,\u201d they are legally required\nto tell the truth, and lying is a criminal offense.\n\nConsequences: The consequences discussed in section 5 largely apply here too. To avoid\nredundancy, key points to reiterate or add include:\n\ne Criminal Liability: A lie under oath in written discovery or affidavits is typically still\n\u201cin connection with\u201d the case, hence potentially aggravated perjury (felony) if\nmaterial. If, say, a husband lied in a deposition about an affair, and that fact was\nmaterial to a fault-based divorce claim, it\u2019s aggravated perjury. If a wife lied in an\naffidavit to obtain a temporary restraining order (for example, falsely claiming the\nhusband threatened her, to get an order and exclusive use of the house), that written\nlie is under oath and material \u2014 perjury as well. The punishment range (up to 10 years\nin prison for aggravated perjury) remains the same. It\u2019s worth noting that each false\nstatement can be: a a separate \u00a9 count of perjury; theoretically a | person who lies multiple\n\naesee ee Ha (On. 3 Vat t= as \u201c\u00abt...-. . = oon os \u00ab34 1 eee Bee\n",

Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 215 authorizes judges to sanction\nparties for abuse of the discovery process, which includes providing false answers.\nSanctions can include exclusion of evidence (for example, if a husband lied about an\nasset, the judge might rule that he cannot later introduce evidence about that asset\u2019s\ncharacterization in his favor), monetary fines, or even striking pleadings. In one case,\na party\u2019s persistent lies in discovery led the court to strike his claims for certain relief,\nessentially deciding those issues against him by default. Additionally, if a final\njudgment is obtained by fraud (which includes perjury), the wronged party may seek\nrelief from that judgment. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 329b(f) and equitable bills of\nreview allow a final judgment to be set aside for extrinsic fraud. For instance, if after\na divorce is finalized, the wife discovers the husband lied under oath about a bank\naccount, she can file a post-divorce action to divide that newly found asset (Tex. Fam.\nCode \u00a79.003 allows undivided community property to be divided upon later\ndiscovery). The court, seeing that the husband lied, could award the entire value of\nthat hidden asset to the wife as a remedy. Essentially, the liar might not only face\ncriminal charges but also lose whatever advantage they sought through the lie.\n\ne Examples: A common example of lying under oath in divorce is undisclosed assets.\nIf one spouse denies having certain assets under oath and it\u2019s later discovered, judges\noften respond harshly. They might award that asset wholly to the other spouse as\npunishment. Texas courts have done this with hidden bank accounts, undeclared real\nestate, even collections of gold or crypto-currency that were lied about. Another\nexample is a parent lying about income in a child support context (under oath on a\nfinancial information sheet). If caught, the court can redo the support calculation and\nmight order retroactive support to recoup what the child lost due to the lie, and order\nthe lying parent to pay the other\u2019s attorney fees used to uncover the truth. On the flip\nside, truthful disclosure is expected: one case saw a wife forget about a small pension\nin her name; she didn\u2019t mention it (not intentionally, she genuinely overlooked it). The\nhusband later found out and accused her of perjury. The court found it was an honest\nmistake (no intent to deceive), so she wasn\u2019t penalized. This highlights that intent is\nkey to perjury \u2014 accidental omissions or memory lapses aren\u2019t criminal. However,\nproving intent is tricky, so courts often look at circumstantial evidence (size of the\nasset, pattern of nondisclosure) to infer whether it was a lie or a mistake\n\nthetxattorneys.com.\n\nImpact on Divorce Outcome: The impact of lying under oath broadly mirrors what was\nsaid for perjury in court. The lying party\u2019s goals in the divorce will likely be thwarted. A\nspouse who lies under oath about finances can expect a less favorable financial judgment:\nthe court might give the innocent spouse a larger share of community property, might order\nthe liar to debt that otherwise might have been split, or might require them to pay attorney\nfees. The rationale is twofold: to do equity (correct the imbalance caused by the lie) and to\ndeter litigants from lying. As cited earlier, hiding assets and lying about them can result in\nforfeiting those assets to the other spouse. One Texas case noted that more important than\nthe monetary sanction was the loss of credibility the lying spouse suffered in the eyes of the\ncourt.\n",

      "text": "Once credibility is lost, the court tends to rule in favor of the other spouse\u2019s claims on\nambiguous issues. For child-related matters, a parent who lies (be it about the other parent\nor their own behavior) may lose the court\u2019s trust, which is essential in custody\ndeterminations. A judge needs to believe that a parent will be honest and act in good faith,\nespecially in joint conservatorship arrangements where parents must cooperate. If one parent\nis found to have lied under oath, the judge might conclude that parent will not foster\ncooperation or might even lie to the court in the future about compliance with orders. As a\nresult, the judge could decide that the other parent should have sole decision-making\nauthority or even primary custody, to ensure the child\u2019s best interests are protected by a\nmore trustworthy guardian.\n\nIn terms of divorce settlements, if one party lies during negotiations (e.g., not disclosing an\nasset during mediation which later comes out), any agreement could be invalidated for\nfraud. The innocent spouse could reopen the settlement upon discovering the lie. This means\nlying under oath can deprive the parties of a stable, final agreement and prolong litigation.\n\nTo encapsulate the policy: Texas law and courts strongly discourage and penalize dishonesty\nin divorce cases. Each spouse is expected to deal fairly and transparently regarding finances\nand children. Lying under oath is not only a crime but also undermines the very basis on\nwhich courts can grant a just divorce. As such, judges often say that a party who lies has\n\u201cshot themselves in the foot\u201d \u2014 they not only face legal penalties but also damage their own\ncase. In the end, the offending spouse stands to lose much more in the divorce than they\nmight have gained had the lie succeeded. Thus, the safest and indeed legally required course\nin any divorce is full honesty and compliance with oaths.\n\nSources:\n\ne Tex.

I wasn't a good husband and i\nrealize it now.. but our marriage wasn't all bad and you know it.\n\nThings happen.

Once this is fixed THEN we can finally start getting divorced.\nGonna take a lot longer now.. wish you would've just listened to me in the beginning.\n\nMara barely passed third grade.\n",

You'll get receipt when the case is opened. It's a\nSAPCR suit.\n\nGiven that the current orders have no legal effect, Mara and Caroline have no legal\nguardian. Rule 44 of Tex. R. CIV. P. Permits me to represent them when there are no legally\nbinding court orders and no legally appointed managing conservators of the children in\nlitigation.\n\nTherefore, they have no legal guardian, and I will be seeking joint managing\nconservatorship appointing me as the primary conservator determining the residence of the\nchildren, and will be seeking 50/50 time.\n\nTheres only one caveat. Due to the fact I've been illegally locked out of my home since\nMarch 6th, 2024, and given that they have had no legal guardian since then - I will be\ninvoking the senate bill discussed in my prior email to reclaim the lost custody time.\n\nI will divide the lost days up in a way that allows the kids to see both of us on a continuous\nbasis in accordance with Texas state Policy.\n\nOnce the case is initiated- if Cooper plans to represent you, she will need to file a Notice of\nAppearance.\n\nI'm going to ask for a preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order to prevent any\ndisturbance of the kids status quo and to allow myself enough time to rebuild what has been\n",
