II. Unopposed Statement of Facts
6. On December 12, 2023, Respondent, Charles Dustin Myers, discovered a significant 
volume of  text messages be tween P etitioner M organ M ichelle Myers and  Damen G ault 
Kazlauskas, Petitioner’s current boyfr iend. See CMR. p.254-714. 
7. In response to this discover y, the Respondent reached out to the Petitioner’s Grandparents 
with a request to talk, who admit to bei ng “blindsided” by Petitioner’s sudden desire for a 
divorce. See CMR. p.716-720. 
8. The following da y, on December 13, 2023, the requested famil y meeting was turned into 
a private meeting  between t he Petitioner a nd her family m embers, as ev idenced b y the 
Petitioner’s text message sent on December 13, 2023, send at 9:55 P.M. CS T. See CMR. p.1715.

3 
 9. Returning home around 1:30 A.M. CST, the text records show that Petitioner began 
communicating via text message with her Stepfather, Daniel Kenneth Branthoover of Yukon, 
Oklahoma at approximately 3:29 A.M. CST. See CMR. p.278. 
10. These communications escalated the following day on December 14, 2023, totaling to 
over 90 text messaged exchanged, which is the same day that the Petitioner sought her first ex -
parte order of protection from this Court. See CMR. p.274-278. See also CMR. p.78 ¶ 9B. 
11. Over the weekend of December 15, 2023, Petitioner traveled to Yukon, Oklahoma, where 
she received assistance in drafting the initial documents submitted to this Court on December 18, 2023, acquired a secondary phone registered under 817-940-0852 which was used in these proceedings, and transferred $1,576 of marital funds to herself using Daniel Branthoover’s PayPal as a medium. See CMR. p.1706. (bank statement showing monetary transfer). See also 
CMR. p.2866. (unanswered request for admissions). See also CMR. p.1715. (text message from 
Petitioner admitting to monetary transfer on December 17, 2023).  
12. The initial documents submitted to this Court on December 18, 2023, are the Original 
Petition for Divorce ( CMR. p.71-81), a Request for Uncontested Cases form (CMR. p.101-102) 
and an Affidavit of Inability to Afford Court Costs (CMR. p.84-96). 
13. In the Original Petition for Divorce, the following misrepresentations were made with 
direct reference to the record that contradicts them:  
 i.  Petitioner claimed she could not afford Court costs yet admits to transferring  
  $1,576 to the day before filing for divorce. See Unopposed Statement of Facts ¶  
  11. 
 ii. Petitioner claimed that the couple stopped living together as spouses on December 
  1, 2023, yet evidence shows the Petitioner at home with respondent on December

4 
   22 and December 29. See CMR. p.74 ¶ 4. See also CMR. p.1734. (screenshot  
  from a video showing Petitioner at home with the Respondent having fun with the 
  Children.)  
 iii. Petitioner claimed to have an active order of protection in place against the  
  Respondent with a finding of family violence during the marriage, which is a  
  blatant lie that cannot be proven. See CMR. p.78 ¶ 10. See also CMR. p. 
 iii. Petitioner claimed to own both family vehicles prior to the marriage despite  
  knowing that both vehicles, one of them being a lease, were financed by the  
  Respondent. See CMR. p.135-136. (Respondent’s TXDPS records showing no  
  prior history of family violence or criminal activity.  
 iv. Petitioner claimed that she would  be harassed, abused, seriously harmed   
  or injured or otherwise subjected to family violence if she  must give the   
  Respondent her new phone number acquired in Oklahoma. See CMR. p.81 ¶ 15. 
14. In the Petitioner’s Statement of Inability to afford Court Costs, the following 
misrepresentations were made with a direct reference to the record that contradicts them:  
 i. The Petitioner claimed she could not afford court costs despite admitting to a  
  monetary transfer of $1,576 the day prior to filing this document. See Unopposed  
  Statement of Facts ¶ 11.  
 ii. The Petitioner claimed to be financially responsible for $1,610 in monthly   
  expenses despite only alleging to make only $744 per month. See CMR. p.89 ¶ 5;  
  see also CMR. p.92 ¶ 6.

5 
  iii. The Petitioner claimed to be financially responsible for the 2023 Mazda CX -5 and 
  a 2021 Mazda CX3 which the couple never owned despite this amount exceeding  
  her alleged monthly income. See CMR. p.93 ¶ 8. 
15. Finally, Petitioner submitted a Request for Uncontested Cases Form which 
misrepresented that this matter is uncontested. See CMR. p.102.  
16. Four days later on December 22, 2023, Petitioner filed for another protective order 
despite claiming to already have an existing order of protection. See CMR. p.103-109 . 
17. In the application for protective order, Petitioner made the following misrepresentations:  
 i. The Petitioner claimed family violence occurred on December 18, 2023, yet  
  waited four days to inform the Court despite filing for divorce on that same day.  
  See CMR. p.108-109. 
 ii. The Petitioner has failed to produce any evidence for these allegations in nearly  
  two years of litigation.  
 iii. The Petitioner can be seen at home with the Respondent and the Children on the  
  same day she filed for protection in no state of emergency. See CMR. p.1716.  
  (image of petitioner at home with Respondent getting the Children ready for bed;  
  See also Unopposed Statement of Fact ¶ 13(ii).  
18.  The totality of these false allegations and misrepresentations lead to the improper 
removal of the Respondent from his home on January 16, 2024. See CMR. p.183. (first order 
removing Respondent from the home without findings or an evidentiary hearing); see also CMR. 
p.118. (show cause summons for Petitioner’s application for protective order)

6 
 19. After this initial decision was made, Petitioner began to leverage her advantage against 
the Respondent as he was thrusted into a situation where he had to acquire legal representation 
on very short notice, only having until January 22, 2024, to do so. 20. On this day, which was the reset hearing before Associate Judge Kaitcer regarding 
Petitioner’s Application for Protective Order, no appearances can be found in the docket, no hearing took place, and the Respondent’s deprivation was extended until February 1, 2024, because the Petitioner waited until right before the hearing to allegedly retain the services of Cooper L. Carter (“Carter”) in the lobby of the courtroom. See CMR. p.186. (associate judge’s 
report resetting the case to February 1, 2024, where Carter’s signature first appears in this matter)  
21. Despite communicating with his attorney regarding his goals, the children’s needs, and 
his reliance on the home for generating income for the family, Dan Bacalis proved to be ineffective in his representation. See CMR. p. 818, ¶¶ 9–11, 13. (communications with Dan 
Bacalis)  
22. After little communication from Dan Bacalis, Respondent reached out and informed him 
that he would be terminating his services and shared his feelings regarding the quality of service that was being provided. See CMR. p.819 ¶ 14. 
23. Despite these concerns, and with no recorded appearances within the case docket, the 
parties appeared on February 1, 2024, where the Respondent was presented with the sole option of a settlement agreement and was given a month back in the home. See CMR. p.229-234. 
(‘agreed’ associate judge’s report signed February 1, 2024)  
24. Respondent “…disagreed with the conditions in the document and advised Mr. Bacalis 
that he wanted to take it to trial because the petitioner did not have any evidence of family violence. Mr. Bacalis advised Mr. Myers that he “knows this Judge and this is the best we can

7 
 get”. Mr. Bacalis stated in whining manner “We’ll be here all day; we can come back and change 
it later”. Mr. Bacalis stated “no one will put a gun to your head if you are not out by March 1st.”  
See CMR. p.1368. (affidavit of Steve Myers, witness) 
25. This is when Respondent paid special attention to the following provisions of the 
agreement found on CMR. p.233:  
  A typed written Order conforming to this Report will follow within 20 days from 
 the date this Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall  be prepared by Dan Bacalis . 
 Each  attorney should approve the Order. The parties do not need to approve the Order. 
 The attorney reviewing the proposed order shall have five (5) days to do so. There are no 
 ten (10) day letters. If an agreement is not reached, a Motion to Sign shall be filed  and 
 set within thirty (30) days from the signing of this Report.  (emphasis added)  
 26. Therefore, we can gather based on the language that this agreement:  
  i.  Required Dan Bacalis to prepare the typed written order;  
  ii. The attorney  reviewing the proposed order would therefore be Cooper L.  
   Carter, attorney for Petitioner.  
  iii. If an agreement was not reached, a motion to sign was required to be filed  
   and set within 30 days of February 1, 2024. 
27. Given these provisions, the Respondent signed the agreement, and immediately 
terminated his attorney thereafter and provided notice to the Court and opposing parties on February 5, 2024. See CMR. p.221-222. (notice of termination of legal counsel)  
28. Following his termination, Respondent prepared an EMERGENCY MOTION TO 
RECONSIDER EVIDENCE AND VACATE TEMPORARY ORDERS. See CMR. p.240-243. 
This was filed alongside a brief and several exhibits that highlighted the Petitioner’s dishonesty. See CMR. p.244-252. (brief in support of emergency motion); See also CMR. p.254 -714 (text 
records highlighting mothers extensive communications with Damen Kazlauskas); CMR. p.716-

8 
 720. (text message from Petitioner’s grandfather showing he was blindsided by the divorce); 
CMR. p.722-723. (financial transaction showing that Petitioner transferred $1,576 to a third 
party prior to filing for divorce); CMR. p.725-731. (overdraft notice from Petitioner’s transfer 
and text communications asking for the funds to be returned); CMR. p.733-735. (eviction suit 
instigated by the Petitioner over the weekend of December 15, 2023); CMR. p.737. (dismissal of 
the eviction suit.)  
29. The opposing counsel, Cooper L. Carter, sent correspondence informing the Respondent 
that she would be filing a counter motion on February 14, 2024. See CMR. p.2794.  
30. By March 4, 2024, Respondent filed a notice with the Court informing the opposing side 
and the Court that he would not be leaving the matrimonial residence as it would not be in the 
best interests of the children.  
31. Two days later, while walking the Children to school, Petitioner took it upon herself to 
lock the Respondent out of the marital residence and left a sign on the door. See CMR. p.829 at 
2024-03-06. (video of Respondent taking the children to school that morning and the sign on the 
door left by Petitioner)  
32. It’s noteworthy that this action came without any response being filed to the emergency 
motion served on her nearly a month prior. 33. Respondent stayed in Flower Mound, Texas, with his father until the March 14, 2024, 
hearing on his emergency motion.  
34. On March 14, 2024, the parties both appeared before Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer, 
despite only the Respondent making an appearance on the case docket. See Exhibit 1, p.3 at DKT. No. 78.

9 
 35. Without responding to the motion, and in violation of the provisions outlined above, 
Cooper L. Carter handed the Respondent the typed written “Temporary Orders” with actual 
knowledge that:  
 i.  Dan Bacalis did not prepare the order;  
 ii. An agreement was not reached and no motion to sign was ever filed or set within  
  the agreed upon timeframe.  
36. Upon inspection of this document, which was signed by both the Petitioner and her 
Counsel, the following misrepresentations were made to the Court:  
 i. That on February 1, 2024, a hearing occurred regarding a motion for temporary  
  orders when this setting was a  reset hearing from the initial protective order  
  setting on January 16, 2024, later extended to January 22, 2024, and then   
  February 1, 2024.  
 ii. That the Court heard arguments and evidence from both sides when in reality the  
  parties had a hallway settlement conference and no evidence was presented. See  
  CMR. p.888.  
 iii. That the orders were in the best interests of the children and the prerequisites of  
  the law have been met.  
 iv. That the parties agree to the terms of the order ‘as evidenced by the signatures  
  below’. See CMR. p.888. This fact was omitted in her response.  
37. Furthermore, Cooper L. Carter, despite not filing any response to the emergency motion, 
handed Associate Judge Jeff Kaitcer a proposed order in the form of an ‘associate judge’s report’ requesting that his motion be denied. See CMR. p.795. This fact was omitted in her response. 
This fact was omitted in her response.

10 
 38. Despite no opposition to his motion, the Associate Judge, who was never vested with any 
order of referral to hear the motion, denied him without explanation, and signed the temporary 
orders prepared by Cooper L. Carter which were handed to the Respondent just moments earlier.  
39. Finally, the temporary orders drafted by Carter contained unilaterally altered terms, 
specifically:  
 i.  In the February 1, 2024, associate judge’s report referenced in the orders prepared 
  by Carter, the agreed terms gave the Respondent until March 1, 2024, to reside in  
  the home. See CMR . p.231 ¶ 7.  
 ii. In the March 14, 2024, temporary orders prepared by Carter, the Respondent was  
  given until March 20, 2024, to reside in the home, and the Petitioner was given  
  access after March 30, 2024, leaving a ten -day period where no party would  
  occupy the home. See CMR. p.1815. This fact was omitted in her response.  
40. Finally, Carter handed Judge Kaitcer an unserved “Proposed Order”  requesting that 
Respondent ’s emergency motion be denied  despite never providing a response to the motion. 
CMR. 795. This fact was omitted in her response.  
III. Introduction  
41. Respondent Charles Dustin Myers  (“Father”) files this Reply to Petitioner Morgan 
Michelle Myers’s  (“Mother”) response to the no-evidence motion for summary judgment. After 
nearly two years of litigation, Mother’s last -minute attempt to avoid summary judgment fails. 
She was required under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 166a(i)  to produce competent evidence 
raising a genuine fact issue on each challenged element of her claims. Instead, she offers only conclusory, self-serving assertions (in an affidavit and sc attered exhibits) and promises of what 
she “plans to give at trial,” which do not satisfy her burden. It remains undisputed that Mother

11 
 has no evidence for the essential elements identified in the motion. Indeed, she ignored written 
discovery entirely, causing Requests for Admission to be deemed admitted by operation of law. Texas law does not permit a claimant to continue a lawsuit in the absence of evidence.  
42. Because Mother’s response points to nothing more than a scintilla  of proof  (at best), 
summary judgment must  be granted as a matter of law.  
43. Mother’s eleventh -hour allegations of family violence, harassment, and even drug use  – 
raised for the first time in her response – are wholly unsubstantiated and suspect. For nearly 22 months , she produced no  police reports, medical records, witness affidavits, or other evidence to 
corroborate her sensational claims. She even withdrew her own protective order application rather than pursuing a finding of family violence in court. Only now, faced with dismissal  of her 
claims , does she submit a self -serving affidavit that was drafted on March 27, 2025, and a 
handful of unauthenticated and cherry-picked text messages in an effort to create a fact issue. The Court should view these belated accusations with extreme skepticism. Unsupported assertions and post hoc allegations cannot defeat a properly supported no-evidence motion. As shown below, Mother’s response contains no competent evidence on each element specifically 
challenged in the motion, and her failure to answer discovery leaves her with no factual basis  to 
avoid summary judgment.  
44. Finally, Mother’s current live pleadings (her Second Amended Petition for Divorce) 
undermine her own positions. She now pleads for relief that contradicts the very temporary 
orders  she asks this Court to keep in place. This inconsistency underscores the lack of merit in 
her claims. In short, Petitioner’s response falls far short of the requirements of Rule 166a(i). The Court should grant summary judgment in Respondent’s favor, dismissing all of Mother’s

12 
 unsupported claims so that Respondent may return to his home and family life, and his 
constitutional rights as a father and homeowner may be restored.  
IV. No-Evidence Summary Judgment Standard s 
45. Under Rule 166a(i), once a no-evidence motion identifies the essential elements where 
no proof exists, the burden shifts to the non-movant to produce “more than a scintilla of evidence”  raising a genuine issue of material fact on each challenged element. If the non -movant 
fails, the Court must  grant summary judgment. “More than a scintilla” means evidence sufficient 
to enable reasonable and fair -minded jurors to differ in their conclusions ; by contrast, evidence 
so weak that it creates only a surmise or suspicion of fact is legally insufficient . Crucially, 
allegations in pleadings or mere promises of future testimony do not constitute evidence. The non-movant must present actual, admissible proof now – such as documents, affidavits, or 
deposition testimony – to demonstrate a fact issue. Texas courts  have emphasized that a party 
cannot avoid summary judgment with conclusory self -serving statements or by simply arguing 
that evidence “may be produced” later . 
46. Here, Respondent’s motion was timely filed after an adequate time for discovery and 
specifically identified the elements lacking evidence. Mother was therefore required to point out 
competent summary judgment evidence  for each of those elements. She has not done so. As 
detailed below, her response relies on speculation and unverified accusations rather than 
admissible proof. Because Mother failed to meet her burden, Rule 166a(i) mandates that 
summary judgment be entere d in favor of Respondent.

13 
 V. Mother’s Complete Failure to Present Evidence on Challenged Elements  
47. Respondent’s motion challenged six essential elements of Mother’s claims on which she 
bears the burden of proof. Mother’s response does not present more than a scintilla of 
competent, admissible evidence on any  of these elements:  
i. No Evidence of Alleged Family Violence:  Mother has produced no credible evidence 
that any “family violence”  (as defined by Texas Family Code § 71.004) ever occurred 
during the marriage. She alleges an incident on December 18, 2023, under oath, but offers nothing to substantiate it beyond her own belated accusations. There are no police reports, medical records, or third -party affidavits  to corroborate any injury or assault. 
In fact, Mother’s own conduct undercuts her claims – after the alleged December 18 incident, she continued living with Father  and took no immediate action consistent with 
being an abuse victim. When given the opportunity to prove family violence in court, she withdrew her application  for a protective order prior to any hearing. This withdrawal 
speaks louder than her late -breaking statements. Mother’s new accusations of harassment 
and drug use are likewise unsupported by any evidence (no witness statements, no requested drug tests, nothing) and were never properly raised until now. Unverified allegations in an affidavit  drafted several months ago – especially after a long silence – 
are not enough to raise a fact issue. At most, Mother’s affidavit is merely a tactical 
weapon that she ’s been sandbagging for nine months and further exposes her bad-faith 
litigation tactics.   
ii. No Evidence of an Active Protective Order or Judicial Family -Violence Finding:  
Mother cannot point to any active protective order  in effect, nor any court finding of 
family violence against Respondent  that was in effect at the time of filing this suit . It is

14 undisputed that no cou rt eve r issued a p rotective order in  this case. M other did file an 
Application for Protective Order on December 22, 2023, but she never followed through –  
the application was non-suited. Thus, there is no signed Protective Order in the r ecord, 
and no judicial finding that family violence occurred. Texas law requires a formal 
hearing and a separate, written or der to grant a f amily-violence protective order (T ex. 
Fam. Code §§ 85.001, 85.004). Mother has neither. In her response, Mother vaguely 
refers to a protective order as if one exists, but this is misleading. Mother ’s inability to 
produce an actual order or judgmen t renders any claim or relief predicated on a protective 
order completely unsupported. In sum, the non-e xistence o f a protective order is an 
incontrovertible f act that negates Mother’s allegations to the contrar y, and this claim is 
precisely what landed her sole use of th e residency to begin with. 
iii. No Evidence of Financial Indigency (False Affidavit of Inability to Pay): Mother 
also failed to produce evidence that she was genuinely indigent  on the date she f iled this 
suit. In her Original Petition (filed December 18, 2023), Mother submitted a sworn 
Affidavit of Inability to Pay Costs claiming extreme financial hardship. However, this 
claim is conclusively refuted by objective facts in the record. Just days before filing, on 
December 15, 2023, Mother withdrew $1,576 in marital funds  – funds which she did 
not disclose in her in digency affidav it. She claimed to have only $ 21 to her name, y et 
evidence shows sh e had access to substantial commun ity money. Mother  has offered no 
bank statements, income records, or any financial documents to support her indigency 
assertion. To the contrary, the available evidence (in cluding her own transactions) shows 
she had resources and even managed to allegedly hir e private counsel

15 
 shortly after filing. Without any evidence substantiating “true indigence,” Mother’s 
affidavit of inability to pay is proven false . Texas law provides that a suit filed on a false 
indigency affidavit may be dismissed or sanctions imposed, because the Practice & Remedies Code does not tolerate proceeding in forma pauperis under false pretenses. At 
the very least, the lack of evidence for indigency means Mother cannot carry any burden 
tied to her financial status or claims for relief premised on indigency. Th is element, too, 
fails as a matter of law.  
iv. No Evidence that Temporary Orders Were Properly Entered or Valid:  Mother’s 
response leans heavily on the Temporary Orders  signed in early 2024, claiming they 
should remain in effect and are in the children’s best interest. But Mother produces no 
evidence that those February 1, 2024 temporary orders were obtained with the required due process  or formalities. In fact, the record shows serious irregularities with how those 
orders came about. Mother cannot point to any notice or hearing  on her December 27, 
2023, motion for temporary relief that resulted in the February 1 orders , and the case 
docket shows that the Petitioner’s only appearance in this matter was on January 16, 2024. There is no transcript or reporter’s record  of any evidence presented on 
February 1, 2024. There is not even a file -marked copy of the temporary orders motion 
showing it was properly served on Respondent in advance. Absent proof that Respondent received due notice and an actual evidentiary hearing was held on February 1, the resulti ng Temporary Orders “lack a lawful foundation.” In short, Mother has no 
evidence that the procedural prerequisites (notice, an opportunity to be heard, and a hearing on the merits) were satisfied before the court signed those sweeping temporary orders. This calls into question the validity and enforcea bility of the orders she seeks to

16 
 uphold. Moreover, Mother repeatedly refers to the February 1 proceeding as an “Agreed” 
temporary orders hearing, yet it is undisputed that Respondent never actually agreed to the terms  that were later signed. Mother has no evidence – no signed consent, no email 
acceptance, nothing – showing that Respondent approved the specific terms of the 
“Agreed” Temporary Orders that were entered on March 14, 2024. To the contrary, all 
evidence indicates Respondent objected  to those terms at every opportunity: the orders 
were drafted unilaterally by Petitioner’s counsel  and presented to the court without 
Respondent’s signature or consent. The signature line for Respondent on the face of the 
order is conspicuously blank, confirming he did not sign it. Respondent has provided sworn testimony (in the mandamus record and elsewhere) that he never agreed  and 
voiced his objections, which stands unchallenged by any evidence from Mother. Thus, Petitioner cannot demonstrate that the temporary orders were the product of a valid agreement or hearing – an essential underpinning of their legitimacy. In fact, Petitioner’s 
counsel, Cooper L. Carter , materially altered and submitted the proposed order after the 
February 1 hearing, without following proper process or obtaining Respondent’s approval , which amounts to a fraud on the court. Respondent promptly filed an 
emergency motion  on February 9, 2024, to alert the Court to these improprieties and to 
vacate the temporary orders, but that motion was effectively brushed aside without any cure for the underlying due process violations  despite receiving no response from the 
opposing side . Mother’s response offers no rebuttal to these facts  and in fact, skips over 
them completely ; she does not deny the lack of notice or the ex parte submission of the 
order. Because Mother has no evidence that the temporary orders were entered with due process or valid agreement, she cannot rely on those orders as a shield to avoid summary

17 
 judgment. Any claims premised on the validity of the February 1, 2024, proceedings are 
unsupported and cannot stand, and are contradicted by the face of the record.  
v. No Evidence that Temporary Orders Are in the Children’s Best Interest:  Even 
setting aside the procedural flaws, Mother has no evidence that the content of the current 
Temporary Orders (which give her exclusive occupancy of the marital home and severely 
limit Father’s possession of the children) is in the best interest of the children . Under 
Texas law, the “best interest of the child shall always be the primary consideration”  in 
determining conservatorship and access. Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002. If Mother w ishes to 
justify the highly restrictive temporary orders, she bears the burden to prove those orders 
benefit the children. Yet she offers nothing  of the sort. There is no expert testimony or 
evaluation from a mental health professional supporting Mother’s position. There are no statements from the children’s teachers or doctors , no school or medical records 
indicating the children are better off under the current temporary arrangement. In fact, Mother disobeyed a court -ordered parenting course (which was me ant to help the 
children cope with the family situation), demonstrating a disregard for the children’s best interests. By contrast, Respondent has continually asserted that removing the children from their father and home has been harmful to them, and Mother’s own evidence inadvertently supports Respondent’s concerns. For example, in one of the text/email exhibits attached to her response, Father poignantly points out that one daughter was coming to his house in distress (asking for a diaper at nearly 7 yea rs old) and that the girls 
have been prevented from even speaking with their father’s side of the family. He laments that the one-sided temporary orders – “procured by deceit and fraud” – have damaged 
the girls’ status quo , and he implores Mother to consider the harm being caused. Rather

18 
 than contradict Respondent, these communications corroborate that the current situation 
is unhealthy for the children and was imposed without proper basis. Mother has simply no evidence to affirmatively show that keeping Father out of the home and on a supervised or restricted schedule is in the children’s best interest. All she offers is the 
refrain that “best interest” is paramount (which is true) and her own speculation that her 
custo dy demands should be litigated. Speculation is not evidence. Because Mo ther has 
not met her burden to produce evidence that the temporary orders’ onerous terms benefit 
the children, this element likewise yields to summary judgment. The Court should not allow baseless temporary orders to continue when they lack evidentiary sup port and, in 
fact, appear to be hurting the children more than helping.  
vi. No Evidence that Respondent Violated Court Orders in Any Material Way:  In an 
effort to smear Respondent, Mother’s response accuses him of various violations  of court 
orders and bad acts (harassment via messages, etc.), but again she offers  no concrete 
evidence of any meaningful violation . The record reflects that Respondent, though 
understandably frustrated by being ousted from his home and limited in access to his children, largely complied  with the temporary orders to avoid further conflict. Mother’s 
exhibits include a series of text messages and emails from Respondent – yet these actually serve to validate Respondent’s position rather than prove willful misconduct. For instance, in the December 19, 2024, email chain that Mother herself su bmitted, 
Respondent addresses Mother’s failure to follow the temporary orders (not informing him directly of a child’s medical needs, not facilitating communication, etc.). He expresses anguish at how the orders are being used as a sword against him and how he will seek to rectify the situation through the legal process. While the tone of these communications is

19 urgent and upset, they do not evidence any threats or violence by Respondent; rather, 
they show a father reacting to Mother’s bad-faith litigation tactics  and the distress they 
caused. Mother has presented no evidence that Respondent ever harmed the children or violated any court order in a manner that endangered anyone. There is no contempt order, no enforcement proceeding with findings against Respondent, nothing beyond Mother’s complaints. Minor technical violations (if any) or angry words in communications do not rise to the level of creating a genuine fact issue on any claim in this case. To defeat summary judgment, Mother needed to present admissible proof  that Respondent 
breached a legal duty or order in a way that supports a cause of action or her requested relief. She has not done so. In the absence of any evidence of significant misconduct  by 
Respondent, Mother cannot avoid summary dismissal of her allegations of harassment or other wrongdoing. 
48. In sum, Mother failed to carry her burde n on each and every one of  the challenged 
elements. Ea ch of  the above  issues i s something  for which Mother w ould bear  the burden of  
proof at trial , yet after ample time for  discovery s he has “adduced nothing – no documents, 
no affidavits, no testimony”  to support them. Her response is built on accusations, not evidence. 
Under Rule 166a (i), “the court must grant” the motion  if the non -movant fails to bring forth 
more than a scintilla of evidence on the challenged  elements. That is precisely th e situation here. 
VI. Deemed Admissions and Discovery Defaults Confirm No Evidence
49. Mother’s l ack of  evidence is further con firmed by her failure to answer written 
discovery i n this cas e. See CMR. 1409 . Respondent served Requests for Admission, 
Interrogatories, and Requests for Production aime d at uncoveri ng any factual support for 
Mother’s cl aims. M other did not  respond within  the time required by t he Texas R ules of  Civil

20 Procedure. By rule, each Request for Admission she left unanswered is automatically deemed 
admitted . See Tex. R. Civ. P. 198.2(c) ; Marshall v. Vise , 767 S.W.2d 699, 700 (Tex. 1989) 
(unanswered requests are deemed admitted by operation of law). These deemed admissions are binding judicial admissions – Mother cannot introduce evidence to contradict them. Marshall , 
767 S.W.2d at 700; Sherman Acquisition II LP v. Garcia, 229 S.W.3d 802, 812 (Tex. App.—Waco 2007,  no pet.) Moreover, deemed admissions are fully competent summary judgment 
evidence that can support a judgment as a matter of law.  Acevedo v. Comm’n for Lawyer 
Discipline, 131 S.W.3d 99, 105 (Tex. App. —San Antonio 2004, pet. denied) 
50. In this case, the deemed admissions effectively negate Mother’s causes of action.
Although the admissions themselves are in the record, a few examples are illustrative (paraphrasing due to their admitted status): Mother has admitted she has no evidence  of physical 
abuse by Respondent; admitted that no protective order was ever issued; admitted that 
Respondent did not breach any court order in a manner harming the children; and admitted that she withdrew funds around the time of filing while claiming indigence. These admissions align with the no -evidence points discussed above, and Mother never sought to withdraw or amend 
them. Thus, even if Mother’s late affidavit could be considered, it cannot create a fact issue  in 
the face of her own conclusive admissions to the contrary  Beasley v. Burns , 7 S.W.3d 768,  769-
70 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 1999, pet. denied). The Court is entitled to rely on the deemed admissions as undisputed facts establishing that Mother lacks evidence for her claims. In short, Mother’s disc overy defaults have sealed the fate of her case: she has judicially conceded the very 
points that entitle Respondent to summary judgment.

21 VII. Mother’s Seco nd Amended Petition filed November 24, 2025, Contradicts the March
14, Temporary O rders , that claim t o be in the C hildren’s Best  Interests 
51. It is also not eworthy  that M other’s live pleadings  in this case do not square with her  
position in this summary judgment proceeding. In her Sec ond Amended Petition fo r Divorce, 
filed the day prior to her response, M other as serts cl aims and  requests r elief that cannot be 
reconciled wit h the premise that the February 1, 2024 Temporary Orders are valid and in the 
children’s best interest. For example, upon information and belief, Mother’s Second Amended 
Petition omits the family-violen ce allegations  that or iginally und erpinned the  ex pa rte temporary 
restraining order and protective order application. She instead pleads primarily “no -fault” 
divorce g rounds, s uggesting  that the marriage is i nsupportable – a stance at od ds with her 
current portrayal of Respondent as an abuser. Likewise, while the Temporary Orders reflect an 
agreement (on paper) t o joint managing conservatorship with standard possession, Mother’s 
amended petition now seeks to modify or overturn those terms (e.g. by requesting sole managing 
conservatorship and supervised access by Father) due to allege d misconduct. Mother cannot have 
it both ways. If the temporary orders were truly agreed a nd in the children’s best interest (as she 
claims w hen i t suits he r), on e would exp ect he r live petition  to m irror that status quo going 
forward. Instead, her Sec ond Amended Petiti on attempts to dramatically change the custodial 
arrangement and revisit issues supposedly settled by the temporary orders . This inconsistency 
undermines Mot her’s cr edibility a nd the integrity of her c laims. I t app ears M other values t he 
temporary orders only as a tactical weapon to keep Respondent out of the home during the case, 
even as s he signals an intention  to seek di fferent  relief at f inal trial. The Court s hould not  credit 
arguments t hat the temporary orders must stand, when Mother’s own pleadings cast doubt on 
their propriety a nd continued viabilit y. This conflict in positions further confirms that the 
temporary or ders w ere a product of  strategic maneuvering  rather t han a fair, ev idence-based

22 resoluti on. As documente d in the Secon d Amended Consolidated Mandam us Record filed i n 
the Texas Supreme Cour t, the chronol ogy of events and Mother’s shifting litigati on posture 
remain undisputed by her. In light of the record as a whole, Mother’s claims have no firm footing 
in fact or law. 
VIII. Respondent’s Communications Highlight Petitioner’s Bad Faith
52. Mother’s r esponse includes various  text m essages and  emails – presumably to paint 
Respondent in a poor light – bu t these actually support R espondent’s case and expose 
Petitioner’s ba d faith. The communications s how a Father de sperate to m aintain con tact w ith his 
childre n and frustrated by Mother’s selective adherence to court orders. In one December 2024 
email, for instance, Respondent admonishes Mother for “hid[ing] behind” the one-sided orders 
while failing  to follow  them herself. H e notes t hat M other was preventing the children from even 
speaking  to their f amily ( violating  the spirit of  co-parenting) and points out that if Mother insists 
on using the orders as a shield, she should at least honor all provisions of those orders. Tellingl y, 
Respondent accuses Mother of fabricating h er indigency (referring t o the false affidavit she 
filed) and of procuri ng the temporary orders “by deceit and fraud,” w ith the assistance of  her 
counsel. Far from being off-t opic rants, t hese statements di rectly a lign with R espondent’s l egal 
position:  that M other misled the court t o gain unf air advantage  and has not  acted in t he children’s 
best interests. Respondent’s passionate tone is the unde rstandable result of a parent who has been 
unjustly de prived of  his home an d children for an extended period. Importantl y, nowhere in 
these communications  does Respondent  threaten h arm or  violate the law – he expressly says he 
will “pur sue litigation” and  hold those responsible accountable “in a ccordance with t he law.”  
These messages, t herefore, do not create any genuine dispute of material fact; if anything, they 
corroborate Respondent’s claims of procedural wrongdoing by Petitioner a nd the deleterious

23 effect of  Petitioner’s a ctions  on the famil y. The Court s hould s ee Mother’s exhi bit ev idence for  
what i t is: an at tempt t o distract from  her lack of  adm issible evidence by  showcasing  
Respondent’s unde rstandabl e concern. S uch distractions do not defeat a summary judgment 
motion. Context matters, and c ommunications  made in the midst of  contentious  litigation  can 
reflect di stress r ather t han cu lpabilit y. Here, t he context  of Respondent’s cherry-pi cked messages 
is a father’s distress caused by M other’s bad -faith tactics, and that context reinforces the 
justness of granting relief to Respondent. 
IX. Conclusion a nd Prayer
53. Mother has had ample time and opportunity to develop her case, but chose not to 
participate in the discovery pr ocess. She has com e up with nothing of  substance. The law i s 
clear: w hen a claimant produces no e vidence to s upport es sential e lements of  her claims, “the 
court must grant the motion” for no-e vidence summary judgment. M other’s r esponse falls f ar 
short of the mark – it is a compilation of excuses, contradictions , and unproven allegations 
dumped o n the Court at the last minute. She asks the Court to ignore the rules of evidence and 
procedure and allow her claims to proceed on mere sympathy or speculation. But Rule 166a(i ) 
was de signed pr ecisely t o prevent  that s cenario and to dispose of  baseless cl aims before they 
consume more time and resources. Courts i n Texas (including in famil y law matters) do not 
hesitate to s ummarily d ismiss cl aims w hen no pr oof supports t hem. This case is a textbook  
example of  one that should b e disposed of  now: Mother’s ext reme allegations  (family vi olence, 
etc.) remain unsubstantiated , and every objective indicator i n the record shows there is no 
genuine fact issue for trial. 
54. Accordingl y, Respondent Charles D ustin Mye rs respectfully prays that the Cour t 
GRANT the no-evidence motion  for summary j udgment  in its ent irety. All of  Mother’s cl aims

24 and requests for relief that lack supporting evidence should be dismissed with prejudice  under 
Rule 166a(i). Such a judgment will finally dissolve the improperly obtained temporary orders, 
allowing Respondent to regain access to his home and children. Justice and equity demand this outcome. After enduring substantial hardship and damage to hi s family life due to Petitioner’s 
meritless accusations, Respondent is entitled to judgment as a matter of law and the restoration of his constitutional rights as a par ent and homeowner.  
55. The Petitioner’s last -ditch effort wholly fails to raise a fact issue, and the motion should
be GRANTED as a matter of law in Respondent’s favor, and the final trial setting ABATED . 
56. Respondent further requests all other relief to which he is justly entitled.
57. Respondent further prays that this Court, its’ staff members, and the opposing side have a
good Thanksgiving holiday, and appreciates the Court’s time in reviewing this document.
