The Temporary Order shall  be prepared by Dan Bacalis . \n Each  attorney should approve the Order.

Therefore, we can gather based on the language that this agreement:  \n  i.  Required Dan Bacalis to prepare the typed written order;  \n  ii. The attorney  reviewing the proposed order would therefore be Cooper L.  \n   Carter, attorney for Petitioner.  \n  iii. If an agreement was not reached, a motion to sign was required to be filed  \n   and set within 30 days of February 1, 2024. \n27.

Indeed, she ignored written \ndiscovery entirely, causing Requests for Admission to be deemed admitted by operation of law.

Because Mother\u2019s response points to nothing more than a scintilla  of proof  (at best), \nsummary judgment must  be granted as a matter of law.  \n43. Mother\u2019s eleventh -hour allegations of family violence, harassment, and even drug use  \u2013 \nraised for the first time in her response \u2013 are wholly unsubstantiated and suspect. For nearly 22 months , she produced no  police reports, medical records, witness affidavits, or other evidence to \ncorroborate her sensational claims. She even withdrew her own protective order application rather than pursuing a finding of family violence in court. Only now, faced with dismissal  of her \nclaims , does she submit a self -serving affidavit that was drafted on March 27, 2025, and a \nhandful of unauthenticated and cherry-picked text messages in an effort to create a fact issue. The Court should view these belated accusations with extreme skepticism. Unsupported assertions and post hoc allegations cannot defeat a properly supported no-evidence motion. As shown below, Mother\u2019s response contains no competent evidence on each element specifically \nchallenged in the motion, and her failure to answer discovery leaves her with no factual basis  to \navoid summary judgment.  \n44. Finally, Mother\u2019s current live pleadings (her Second Amended Petition for Divorce) \nundermine her own positions. She now pleads for relief that contradicts the very temporary \norders  she asks this Court to keep in place. This inconsistency underscores the lack of merit in \nher claims. In short, Petitioner\u2019s response falls far short of the requirements of Rule 166a(i). The Court should grant summary judgment in Respondent\u2019s favor, dismissing all of Mother\u2019s",

Respondent\u2019s motion challenged six essential elements of Mother\u2019s claims on which she \nbears the burden of proof. Mother\u2019s response does not present more than a scintilla of \ncompetent, admissible evidence on any  of these elements:  \ni. No Evidence of Alleged Family Violence:  Mother has produced no credible evidence \nthat any \u201cfamily violence\u201d  (as defined by Texas Family Code \u00a7\u200971.004) ever occurred \nduring the marriage. She alleges an incident on December 18, 2023, under oath, but offers nothing to substantiate it beyond her own belated accusations. There are no police reports, medical records, or third -party affidavits  to corroborate any injury or assault. \nIn fact, Mother\u2019s own conduct undercuts her claims \u2013 after the alleged December 18 incident, she continued living with Father  and took no immediate action consistent with \nbeing an abuse victim. When given the opportunity to prove family violence in court, she withdrew her application  for a protective order prior to any hearing. This withdrawal \nspeaks louder than her late -breaking statements. Mother\u2019s new accusations of harassment \nand drug use are likewise unsupported by any evidence (no witness statements, no requested drug tests, nothing) and were never properly raised until now. Unverified allegations in an affidavit  drafted several months ago \u2013 especially after a long silence \u2013 \nare not enough to raise a fact issue. At most, Mother\u2019s affidavit is merely a tactical \nweapon that she \u2019s been sandbagging for nine months and further exposes her bad-faith \nlitigation tactics.   \nii. No Evidence of an Active Protective Order or Judicial Family -Violence Finding:  \nMother cannot point to any active protective order  in effect, nor any court finding of \nfamily violence against Respondent  that was in effect at the time of filing this suit .

Mother \u2019s inability to \nproduce an actual order or judgmen t renders any claim or relief predicated on a protective \norder completely unsupported. In sum, the non-e xistence o f a protective order is an \nincontrovertible f act that negates Mother\u2019s allegations to the contrar y, and this claim is \nprecisely what landed her sole use of th e residency to begin with. \niii. No Evidence of Financial Indigency (False Affidavit of Inability to Pay): Mother \nalso failed to produce evidence that she was genuinely indigent  on the date she f iled this \nsuit. In her Original Petition (filed December 18, 2023), Mother submitted a sworn \nAffidavit of Inability to Pay Costs claiming extreme financial hardship. However, this \nclaim is conclusively refuted by objective facts in the record. Just days before filing, on \nDecember 15, 2023, Mother withdrew $1,576 in marital funds  \u2013 funds which she did \nnot disclose in her in digency affidav it. She claimed to have only $ 21 to her name, y et \nevidence shows sh e had access to substantial commun ity money. Mother  has offered no \nbank statements, income records, or any financial documents to support her indigency \nassertion. To the contrary, the available evidence (in cluding her own transactions) shows \nshe had resources and even managed to allegedly hir e private counsel",

Texas law provides that a suit filed on a false \nindigency affidavit may be dismissed or sanctions imposed, because the Practice & Remedies Code does not tolerate proceeding in forma pauperis under false pretenses. At \nthe very least, the lack of evidence for indigency means Mother cannot carry any burden \ntied to her financial status or claims for relief premised on indigency.

But Mother produces no \nevidence that those February 1, 2024 temporary orders were obtained with the required due process  or formalities.

Moreover, Mother repeatedly refers to the February 1 proceeding as an \u201cAgreed\u201d \ntemporary orders hearing, yet it is undisputed that Respondent never actually agreed to the terms  that were later signed.

The signature line for Respondent on the face of the \norder is conspicuously blank, confirming he did not sign it. Respondent has provided sworn testimony (in the mandamus record and elsewhere) that he never agreed  and \nvoiced his objections, which stands unchallenged by any evidence from Mother. Thus, Petitioner cannot demonstrate that the temporary orders were the product of a valid agreement or hearing \u2013 an essential underpinning of their legitimacy. In fact, Petitioner\u2019s \ncounsel, Cooper L.

Mother\u2019s response offers no rebuttal to these facts  and in fact, skips over \nthem completely ; she does not deny the lack of notice or the ex parte submission of the \norder.

No Evidence that Temporary Orders Are in the Children\u2019s Best Interest:  Even \nsetting aside the procedural flaws, Mother has no evidence that the content of the current \nTemporary Orders (which give her exclusive occupancy of the marital home and severely \nlimit Father\u2019s possession of the children) is in the best interest of the children .

By contrast, Respondent has continually asserted that removing the children from their father and home has been harmful to them, and Mother\u2019s own evidence inadvertently supports Respondent\u2019s concerns. For example, in one of the text/email exhibits attached to her response, Father poignantly points out that one daughter was coming to his house in distress (asking for a diaper at nearly 7 yea rs old) and that the girls \nhave been prevented from even speaking with their father\u2019s side of the family. He laments that the one-sided temporary orders \u2013 \u201cprocured by deceit and fraud\u201d \u2013 have damaged \nthe girls\u2019 status quo , and he implores Mother to consider the harm being caused.

All she offers is the \nrefrain that \u201cbest interest\u201d is paramount (which is true) and her own speculation that her \ncusto dy demands should be litigated. Speculation is not evidence. Because Mo ther has \nnot met her burden to produce evidence that the temporary orders\u2019 onerous terms benefit \nthe children, this element likewise yields to summary judgment.

The record reflects that Respondent, though \nunderstandably frustrated by being ousted from his home and limited in access to his children, largely complied  with the temporary orders to avoid further conflict.

There is no contempt order, no enforcement proceeding with findings against Respondent, nothing beyond Mother\u2019s complaints.
