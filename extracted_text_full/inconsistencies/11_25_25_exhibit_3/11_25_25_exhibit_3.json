I don't want any trouble.. I don't care about Caitlin, I don't care\nabout the state of the house or what's been destroyed that's mine - all I care about is being\nwith the girls.. and upon receipt I have every legal right to do so.\n\nI don't want anyone there to ruin this moment for the girls. Papaw and Meme need to stay\nout of it. If they want to get involved - they will need to go through the courts and do things\nthe right way.\n\nBecause as of today, 03/19/2025, you are still my wife, we are still legally married and live\nat 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148, where you claimed we both own the\nmatrimonial home.\n\nI will give you a day to prepare if I hear back from you, and will be coming home first thing\nFriday morning.\n\nI didn't petition for sole use. Only to decide where the kids live. Let's just do this right so we\ncan get divorced.\n\nIts been a long year for me.\n\nHoping you contact me so we can arrange this. You can call me at 817-546-3693 any time.\n",

Stamped it with a notary seal made of toast. The clerk blinked Morse code at\nme, each dot a denial, each dash a delay. I whispered back: \"Due process, maybe...?\" She\nshrugged. Per curiam. I wore a tie made of subpoenas, each one ignored like a bedtime story\nread to no one. Shoes made of unserved motions, my footsteps echoing through halls where\njustice used to live. I approached the bench riding a unicycle of hearsay. The judge levitated,\nthe record evaporated, and Morgan's counsel dissolved into a fog of alleged representation. I\nasked, \u201cDo you even have authority?\u201d The fog replied: Per curiam. The bailiff offered me a\nlemon \u2014 bright yellow, bitter as the day they took my children without a hearing. I\nobjected. He smiled like he\u2019d heard that line before. I hit him with the door on my way out.\nPer curiam. I cried out, \"But I never agreed!\" The courtroom answered in silence. The\nTemporary Orders danced across the floor, signed in invisible ink. They spoke in tongues:\n\"As evidenced by the signatures below...\" There were none. But the judge still nodded. Per\ncuriam. M.E.M. drew a picture of our house. Said: \u201cDaddy, when are you coming home?\u201d\nC.R.M. left his shoes by the door \u2014 still waiting. I filed my heart as Exhibit A. They struck\nit. Hearsay. I tried again. Filed their laughter, their drawings, their birthdays I missed. The\nclerk stapled it to a stack of motions never read. Per curiam. Somewhere, a gavel bangs. But\nnot for me. Not for them. Just another ghost echo in a court that doesn\u2019t listen, doesn\u2019t look,\ndoesn\u2019t feel. But still I file. Still I write. Still I fight. For them. Per curiam.\n",

In March 2022, \u201cwhen business\nexploded faster than my systems could handle, I made the calculated choice to pause\nadvertising \u2014 not because demand was gone, but because I needed to strengthen the\nfoundation so it could sustain that growth.\n\nBy January 2024, that foundation was ready. My systems were rebuilt, my product was\nmarket-ready, and the relaunch was set to capture a much larger audience than before. That\nwas when you blindsided me with a sudden divorce filing in December 2023, coupled with\nfalse statements that removed me from my home, my workspace, and my livelihood.\n\nThe result? You didn\u2019t just interrupt a job \u2014 you froze a growth trajectory. You didn\u2019t just\nstop income \u2014 you cut off the very momentum I had built for years. And from January\n2024 to today, that disruption has caused an estimated $118,000+ in lost revenue, with\ndamages still growing every single month.\n\nNow - with no reliable internet connection available to meet the latency demands - I am\nunable to scale, and won't ever be able to until I am able to have the infrastructure you\nripped out from underneath me.\n\nYou lied about me, made the issues you claim to be the reasons behind our \"divorce\" about\nyou being a victim, when you knew damn well and we had discussed it and there was a plan\nmoving forward.\n\nYou did all of this because you're a liar, a cheater, and a horrible friend. Anyone who would\nwillingly insert themselves into the life of a family with two young children is a scumbag,\nand that's what you're now with.\n\nThis is what the Federal suit is about. It's about the major damage you've caused to not only\nmy future, but the girls' and your own as well. You traded the rest of your life for a short-\nterm splurge that has done nothing positive for anyone other than you, and your lousy\nboyfriend.\n\nYou traded someone who cared about your children deeply for someone who was willing to\ndisrupt their life for his own benefit.\n\nYou two are the most selfish human beings on the planet, and you both - and Dan - will be\nheld accountable.\n\nI've attached the evidence that you think doesn't matter.\n\nThe reality of the damage you've caused grows each day, and whether you like it or not,\nyou're going to have to grow up and deal with it before we can get divorced.\n\nThe question is: how much more of our children's lives will you sacrifice for Damen?\n\nThe scary part - is I believe you would sacrifice all of it.\n\nVau'we enent the lact 1 4 weare naintinga me ac the willian urhen wan need ta lank in the mirrar\n",
