Otherwise. please don't contact me again while | pursue litigation against you and your family that decided to\nimplicate themselves in this disaster you've created.\n\nAlso - Caroline is nearly 7 years old, lives with all women, yet she comes to me every night she's here asking for a diaper as if there's no effort whatsoever to potty train her.\n\nIn the future, you'll need to contact me through an attorney - no - not Cooper Carter, an actual attorney. What you've done over the last year is unacceptable and will be resolved in accordance with the law. The divorce will likely be\ndismissed for DWOP given your representation has no ability to prosecute the case.\n\nEven if she did - the blatant fabrication of the IFP you filled out with the assistance of Mr. Branthoover is grounds in and of itself to dismiss the case.\nSo while you're making your record for trying to be \u201chelpful\u201d, you haven't been. You've been destructive, careless, and reckless, and will have to answer for your actions at some point.\n\nIf you're going to use the orders to prevent the girls from talking to their own family and father when requested, then the least you can do is follow the rest of the orders since that seems to be what you live by, as sad as that is given\nthey were procured by deceit and fraud.\n\n| had my childhood taken from me, and | will not let you get away with what you've done by taking advantage of the hard work | put in for your benefit and my detriment.\n\n| told you in the beginning you would hurt more than just me and the girls, and you've done it. By involving Dan, Meme, and Caitlin, and by showing no remorse or efforts to realize the actual damage you've caused - | hope you\nunderstand that I've been put in a position to ensure everyone is properly adjudicated for their role in the destruction of the girls' status quo.\n\nMy mission is clear: shed light on what has happened, and seek damages from those responsible to ensure the girls\u2019 future remains stable.\nDon't message me again unless it's an emergency related to the girls.\n\nCharlie\n\nOn Thu, Dec 19, 2024 at 2:59 PM Morgan Myers <morganmw02@gmail.com> wrote:\nFor Mara\u2019s eye drops, she needs one drop 4x a day.

You have been downright vile, malicious, and honestly childish.\n\nThese emails come off as a threat to you - a nuisance - but it's the only way I'm able to\ncommunicate given your complete detachment from reality.\n\nI honestly don't care about your feelings Morgan. Not anymore. I care about my kids, and\none day - whether it's now - or much later in the future - you'll realize that.\n\nIf I were really out to get you, why would I file a motion to dismiss, and not a motion for\nsanctions, contempt, or call the police and report your crimes?\n\nBECAUSE IT'S NOT BEST FOR THE KIDS.\n\nWake up Morgan. You've been asleep since November 30th, 2023.

If | won't be getting them on a Thursday, I'll let you know the day prior to ensure you are\nkept updated.\n\nEverything else is irrelevant.\nAlso, Mara missed school today and you forgot to mention it.\n\nI'll be getting the girls on Thursday depending on if | can get the suit filed against Dan. |'ll let you know here by Wednesday at 6pm if\nI'll be coming.\n\nThanks\n\nOn Mon, Dec 9, 2024, 4:07 PM Morgan Myers <morganmw02@gmail.com> wrote:\nKeeping you updated, since you still aren't able to see my messages in AppClose.\n\nMara has a few things coming up. This Thursday, December 12th, is the 3rd grade program. It's at the school at 6pm. She has a\nsmall speaking part. She also has a field trip to see the Nutcracker on Friday, December 13th. No chaperones needed, and her\nticket has already been paid for. They leave in the morning, and are back by 1pm.\n\nDue to the program, we need to make a plan for your Thursday visitation. If you still plan to pick them up from school, | will pack the\nclothes Mara needs to wear in her backpack so she can change. You will need to get her back to the school at 5:30. | will be there\nat 5:30 so | can fix her hair, if needed.\n\nShe also has a solar system project due on January 7th. Since the girls will be with you during most of the break, I'd appreciate it if\nyou made sure she spent some time working on it. There were multiple options for how she wanted to present it, and she chose\npowerpoint. Let her log into Canvas on any computer, and the tools she needs to complete it are there. I'll help her after she gets\nback home on the 28th. The info page for the project will be in her binder for reference.\n\nHere's the link for Canvas if you don\u2019t already have it bookmarked:\nsslink.com/bisdtx\n\nThe holiday shop is going on this week at the school that the girls can shop at and buy gifts for family. If you want to send them with\nmoney, or shop with them during lunch, it closes mid-day on Friday.\n\nLastly, their class Christmas parties are next week. If you want to volunteer or provide snacks for the class, please email their\nteachers. | will not be able to attend due to work.

As far as documentation, you have failed to respond to the discovery request served back on September 19th, 2024, which\nincluded admissions.\n\nWhen a party fails to respond to a request for admissions, the requests are deemed admitted \"without the necessity of a court order.\"\nTex.R.Civ.P. 198.2(c). Admissions of fact on file at the time of a summary judgment hearing constitute competent summary judgment\nevidence. Acevedo v. Comm'n for Lawyer Discipline, 131 S.W.3d 99, 105 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 2004, pet. denied); Mackie v.\nGuthrie, 78 S.W.3d 462, 468 (Tex. App.-Tyler 2001, pet. denied) (citing Tex.R.Civ.P. 166a(c)).\n\nThere is a pending summary judgement which is also unresponded to, filed and served on February 22nd, 2024.\n\nThis means that all admissions of fact will be admitted into evidence at the summary judgement hearing should the Federal District\nCourt for the Northern District of Texas remand the case for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nThe summary judgement hearing is the oldest motion on record, and will be the first motion scheduled for hearing if necessary on\nremand.\n3. As far as the orders are concerned, they also state the following:\n\n\u201cThat the marital address is 6641 Anns Court, which is not correct. This was pointed out prior to its rendition, and no amendment\nhas been filed.\n\n*That the parties must take the parenting class and file a notice of completion with the court, which you failed to do.\n\n*That the Petitioner receive exclusive use of the residency pending the divorce. In Pennsylvania, Texas, New Jersey, and most\nother states in the US, there\u2019s an administrative order known as the status quo, which requires the soon-to-be ex-spouses to shun\nfrom disrupting the norm created throughout the length of the marriage. \"Exclusive\" - meaning excluding or not admitting other\nthings. By moving in your sister to the residence, you are not \"exclusively\" using the marital home with the children.\n",

Living Expenses\n\ne Airbnb costs (to remain near my daughters) for as long as possible: $14,000\ne Hotel Costs: $960.45\ne Total increased living expenses: $14,000 + $960.45 = $14,960.45\n\n3. Travel and Transportation Costs\n\ne Tolls for visitation and transportation to see daughters: $1,800\ne Car repairs caused by wife\u2019s damage: $1,600\ne Total travel and transportation costs: $1,800 + $1,600 = $3,400\n\n4.

Legal and Related Costs\n\ne Legal fees and associated costs related to this situation: $3,000\n\n7. Emotional Distress\n\ne The financial and physical strain from being displaced, combined with the emotional distress of limited access to my\ndaughters, has caused significant emotional harm. A claim for emotional damages in the amount of $1,000 is being sought\nper month that this continues or until justification is provided.\n\nStart = March 6th, 2024.\ntoday = December 5th, 2024.\nAs of tomorrow, totaling to: $11,000\n",

This theft was malicious, unjustified, and\ncompletely disregarded our children\u2019s welfare around the Christmas holidays.\n\nFalse Indigence Declaration:\nYou misled the court by falsely claiming indigence, despite clear evidence that you had access to sufficient funds. This\nfraudulent act constitutes perjury, as it was intended to gain unlawful advantage through the court system.\n\nMalicious Conduct with Intent to Harm:\n\nYour actions were not isolated incidents but part of a larger pattern of calculated, malicious behavior designed to paint\nyourself as a victim while disregarding the truth and well-being of your family.

You're just a toxic human being with no regard for\nanyone but yourself.\n\nYou aren't even aa parent anymore.\nWhat part of your brain thinks you're doing the right thing?\nYou realize you're still sleeping on the bed my mom gave us, so why haven't you thrown that out to the curb? Because you need it?\n\nOur kids have neither parent now. You're making less than | made before you destroyed everything, and you are doing EXACTLY what\n| said you would in the beginning.. using your grandparents just like you always have.\n\nThree reminders:\n\n1. | still live at 6641 Anne Ct, Watauga, TX 76148.\n\n2. We will not be divorced until you're held accountable by either the judges or a jury trial.\n\n3. You had an affair, got caught, and this is all a ruse to escape accountability.\n\nAttached will be the evidence showing that you took my personal property and threw it on the curb, clearly with anger.\nDespite all of this, | still pray for you each night.\n\nCya\n",

This communication\nconstitutes a good faith effort to resolve the matters at hand without necessitating judicial intervention.\n\n1. Residency and Custodial Arrangements\n\nThe Respondent will not seek an injunction for exclusive use of the residence during the recovery period, as the primary\nconcern for maintaining the residency is based on financial necessity rather than any intention to deprive you of your home or\naccess to the children. The Respondent will request primary joint conservatorship during the recovery period to protect the status\nquo of the children. This arrangement will remain in place until Respondent is able to secure alternative housing in close proximity,\nshould you choose to waive the option of cohabitation, as described below, to ensure the children remain in their home during the\ntransition.\n\n2. Business Losses and Financial Impact\n\nThe abrupt exclusion from the residence has significantly hindered Respondent's ability to operate his business, resulting in a\n41% loss of clientele and a 50% decrease in revenue. This not only affects Respondent's financial stability but also impedes the\nability to support the minor children.\n\nTo remedy this, the Respondent will demand a recovery schedule that grants 1.25 days for each day of missed parenting\ntime and property deprivation. This is to address not only the lost time with the children but also the financial losses incurred due to\nthe combined actions of your attorney and the trial court which stemmed from your initial pleadings. You may remain in the residence\nduring this period; however, if this arrangement proves impractical or undesirable, Respondent will petition the Court for primary\nconservatorship under Texas Family Code \u00a7 156.101, thereby modifying the current custodial order to reverse the conservatorship\nroles.\n\nUpon your response, Respondent will furnish documentation substantiating these losses, including financial statements, client\ntermination records, and revenue reports, in compliance with Texas Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 194 regarding disclosure of\ninformation.\n\n3. Validity of Current Temporary Orders\n\nGiven that the current orders have been filed by an attorney potentially lacking proper authority to represent you, they potentially\ncontravene Texas Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 12 and the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct. Furthermore,\nRespondent was not served with any supporting motion as mandated by Texas Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 21a, and the orders\nwere entered as \"agreed\" despite Respondent's prior withdrawal of consent, rendering them voidable under Texas precedent.\n\nGiven these procedural deficiencies, the ongoing appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas, and the question of authority regarding\nyour attorney - there exists a substantial likelihood that the current temporary orders may be declared rightfully void ab initio, which will\nrequire new orders be put in place. Respondent seeks to address and rectify this matter amicably, without further court involvement\nwith orders that truly suit the children's best interests.\n\nThe rushed nature of the decisions made here now have wasted an extraordinary amount of time, and Respondent believes\nthe terms of these orders are the quickest way to a final decree of divorce at this time.\n\n4. Financial Support Obligations\nTo promote the welfare of Mara and Caroline during the recovery window, Respondent agrees to:\n\n- Resume payment of $800 per month in rent for the marital residence to Margie Evonne Wilson and will seek a temporary injunction\nenjoining her from harassing, threatening, or otherwise disturbing the peace of the Respondent or the Children during the recovery\nperiod.\n\n- Assume financial responsibility for both vehicles, including payment for associated insurance and Respondent's phone services.\n- Secure health insurance coverage for the minor children.\n\n- Cover 100% of all medical, dental, and psychological expenses incurred on behalf of the children.\n\nThe Respondent will further seek that the court requires child support payments amounting to 10% of your net monthly income during\nthe recovery period.\n\n5.

Request for Temporary Injunction\n\nThe Respondent will seek a temporary injunction to preserve the status quo and protect the financial interests of the minor\nchildren during the recovery period. Respondent will request that the Court waive the requirement of a bond under 105.001(d) of the\nTexas Family Code for the welfare of Mara and Caroline given that the injunction aims solely to safeguard the welfare of the children.\n\n7. Next Steps and Request for Response\n\nIn light of the pending Rule 12 motion challenging the authority of your current counsel, Respondent is directing this correspondence\nto you personally. You may forward this correspondence to Ms. Carter if you deem necessary.\n\nUpon your response, Respondent is prepared to provide all relevant documentation and answer any questions pertaining to:\n- The calculated damages and financial losses incurred.\n\n- The loss of clients and revenue impacts.\n\n- Any other pertinent information necessary for the resolution of this matter.\n\n- The need for the residency\n\n- The logistics moving forward\n\nRespondent remains committed to reaching an equitable and swift resolution in the best interests of Mara and Caroline, in accordance\nwith Texas Family Code \u00a7 153.002. The current trajectory must be reassessed, and this is another opportunity to do so.\n\nIf no response is given within 48 hours, or if no meaningful conversation can be obtained, | will be filing the Motion for Temporary\nOrders with the court.\n\nDespite the damage done, that doesn't mean that things can't begin to turn around for Mara and Caroline's sake.\n\nAfter the recovery, we can revisit custody arrangements and visitation schedules to determine what's best for all parties once an\nalternate residency is secured to preserve the financial stability of the children.\n\nPlease provide a written response within 48 hours of receipt of this letter. Failure to respond will compel Respondent to proceed with\nfiling the motion and to certify to the Court that reasonable efforts were made to resolve these matters without judicial intervention, as\nrequired by Tarrant County Local Rule 4.01(10)(b).\n\nBest,\n\nCharlie\n\nCharlie\n\nae\n\n",
