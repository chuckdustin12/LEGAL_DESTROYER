PARTE APPEARANCE

Respondent.

2025-04-04

TO THE HONORABLE COURT:

IMPROPER EX-PARTE APPEARANCE, and in support thereof, urgently brings the following

to the court’s attention:

1. Cooper L. Carter, counsel for Petitioner, intends to present a motion to consolidate to

5. The Motion does not state the specific reasons why it is requested, why it would serve  
 
the best interests of the children and mentions nothing of the objection. 
 
6. Additionally, COOPER L. CARTER has not shown her authority to act in this matter  
 
has not filed anything into the case since April 24, 2024, nearly twelve months ago. 
 
7. Finally, COOPER L. CARTER’s cannot “walk” the  
court for signature on this motion in the face of these issues, and further, because it is 
procedurally improper.  
8. The Texas Family Code states 6.407(b) states that “…either party to the suit for 
dissolution of a marriage may move that court for transfer of the suit affecting the 
parent-child relationship to the court having jurisdiction of the suit for 
dissolution..[o]n the transfer of the proceedings, the court with jurisdiction of the suit 
for dissolution of a marriage shall consolidate the two causes of action.” 
9. No transfer motion has been filed with the 233rd District Court, and opposing  
 
counsel cannot just approach the bench with an improperly filed  
 
consolidation motion that doesn’t comport to Texas law and then attempt to present it  
 
ex-parte to the bench without any mention of the objection. 
 
CONCLUSION 
For these reasons, unless a response is filed by the proper attorney of record, or  
COOPER L. CARTER’s authority is Proven pursuant to Rule 12 of the Texas Rules of  
Civil Procedure, it would be not only inappropriate to grant this motion filed by a nonparty,  
but it would also be prejudicial to not address the objection filed by the Respondent.

desperately needed, and in the face of a matter she hasn’t been prosecuting. Further, the court  
cannot proceed with the motion until COOPER L. CARTER satisfies her obligations pursuant to  
Rule 237a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, as outlined in the objection filed April 2, 2025. 
Finally, COOPER L. CARTER has shown an inability to effectively represent her client, and is  
causing further unnecessary delay.  
 
This case should be dismissed for want of prosecution, the consolidation motion declared 
moot, and Cooper L. Carter can instead defend her client in the original SAPCR. Her attempt to  
prematurely obtain an ex-parte ruling on a contested motion without regard is unacceptable.
