4. This places the obligation on COOPER L. CARTER to file with the clerk of the state 
court a certified notice of remand, which she has failed to do as of March 31, 2025, nearly three 
months later. 
5. COOPER L. CARTER’s authority to represent MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS has been in 
question since September 20, 2024, in cause number 322-744263-23 and is similarly in question in the 
instant case. 
6. COOPER L. CARTER has never filed a pleading on MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS’ behalf 
in either this court or the 322nd district court since she was allegedly retained on January 22, 2024, in her 
individual capacity over fourteen months ago. 
7. RODERICK D. MARX has filed every pleading on behalf of COOPER L. CARTER in both 
this matter and the divorce matter.

26. At the close of business on March 28, 2025, nothing was ever filed with the 322nd 
District Court by COOPER L. CARTER.

28. Petitioner’s detriment to his position is the fact that he is self-represented. 
29. Respondent’s detriment to her position is the lack of prosecution or defense. 
II. ARGUMENT 
30. When it comes to remand, the obligation falls on the plaintiff to file with the state 
court a certified copy of the order of remand. TEX. R. CIV. P. 237a; see also Kashan v. McLane 
Co., NO. 03-11-00125-CV, 7 (Tex. App. Jun. 7, 2012) (holding that rule 237a’s notice 
requirements cannot be satisfied by the district court, but must come from the plaintiff.)  
 
31. This prevents any trial on the merits, and prevents any relief to the Petitioner and his 
children.  
 
32. All other facts supported by evidence have already been provided to COOPER L. 
CARTER yet continues to not engage and instead call in favors from the bench.  
 
III. CONCLUSION 
Petitioner traveled to this court with a prepared emergency supported by exhibits only to 
be turned away at the eleventh hour due to his self-represented status and in the face of no real 
opposition. The children were denied due process outright, and now have been left without a 
remedy. The proper course of action should have been to hear the TRO and put in place 
protections for the minor children pending any promises of consolidation.

30. When it comes to remand, the obligation falls on the plaintiff to file with the state
court a certified copy of the order of remand. TEX. R. CIV. P. 237a; see also Kashan v. McLane
Co., NO. 03-11-00125-CV, 7 (Tex. App. Jun. 7, 2012) (holding that rule 237a’s notice

31. This prevents any trial on the merits, and prevents any relief to the Petitioner and his
children.

32. All other facts supported by evidence have already been provided to COOPER L.

CARTER yet continues to not engage and instead call in favors from the bench.

Il. CONCLUSION
Petitioner traveled to this court with a prepared emergency supported by exhibits only to
be turned away at the eleventh hour due to his self-represented status and in the face of no real

remedy. The proper course of action should have been to hear the TRO and put in place

The above statement of facts, unless promptly rebutted by COOPER L. CARTER, warrant 
immediate relief as duly requested in the emergency TRO through a declaratory judgement, and this court 
should proceed with the hearing date originally set for April 10th, 2025, and the emergency TRO should be 
GRANTED without further delay. 
COOPER L. CARTER disrupted much needed relief for the minor children in this case with false 
promises delivered to the tribunal that directly undermined the Petitioner’s due process rights. COOPER L. 
CARTER is fully aware that she cannot file anything in 322nd District Court because in doing so she would 
be acting ultra vires.   
Petitioner reasserts his position that COOPER L. CARTER is acting without authority, has no 
ability to comply with 237a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and cannot explain how she is able to 
abandon a case for nearly a full calendar year, yet can suddenly show up to defend her alleged client before 
this court for the sole purpose to prevent Petitioner’s emergency TRO from being heard, which was 
permitted despite being told he could present the motion. In what sense is this appropriate when children 
are involved? Does the attorney’s license give her a free pass to thwart the rules and litigate in bad faith? 
It may be a needle in the haystack, but this case defies the initial presumption that pro-se litigants 
are not as equipped or as capable as licensed attorneys, and it is no fault of COOPER L. CARTER. The 
Petitioner reminds the court that the true culprit responsible for this circumstance remains the puppet master 
hiding in the background – the Respondent – and yet Petitioner wishes no harm to her because this litigation 
is about the children. The children need their mother, but they also need their father.  
Perhaps the zealous passion has been misunderstood for contempt by the tribunal, but Petitioner’s 
motive runs parallel to that set forth in the Texas Family Code. However, despite the procedural quagmire, 
the anomalies, the pro-se status, the solution remains simple:  
Grant the relief. Nobody has argued against it, Texas law demands it, and the best interests of the 
Children depend on it. There remains no logical or legal basis to give COOPER L. CARTER any further 
deference in the face of Petitioner’s self-represented status. Petitioner welcomes any response from

COOPER L. CARTER to the contrary. If such response were to be filed, it would be the first in over fourteen 
months of litigation. 
If approached from a logical standpoint, the situation can be interpreted as such: 
i. 
COOPER L. CARTER is shackled by Rule 12 and Rule 237a of the 
Texas Rules of Civil Procedure from reaching final trial. 
ii. 
The 322nd District Court is shackled from proceeding due to Cooper 
L. Carter’s failure to prosecute. 
iii. 
The Petitioner is shackled from his home, his children’s daily lives, 
and his place of business under facially void orders that claim 
consent. 
iv. 
Most critically, the children are shackled in a situation that is not in 
their best interests and continue to suffer irreparable harm without 
any opportunity for relief and without any lawful basis. 
Indeed, that leaves just one party un-chained from this situation:  
the Respondent. Petitioner rests his case. 
IV. PRAYER 
WHEREFORE promises considered, the Petitioner, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, 
requests the following expedited relief: 
1. Take judicial knowledge that COOPER L. CARTER disrupted an emergency in 
bad faith and failed to fulfill her promise. 
2. Grant the emergency TRO without delay and keep the original hearing date set 
for April 10th as agreed by the parties on March 28th, 2025.  
3. Give no further deference to attorney COOPER L. CARTER, who has not 
prosecuted nor defended her position, and require a written response.

December 4, 2024. Defendant removed this case to federal court, citing “deprivation of 
constitutionally protected rights under the 14th Amendment.” ECF No. 1-1. The removal statute 
allows a defendant to “remove a state court action to federal court only if the action could have 
originally been filed in federal court.” 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a); Anderson v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 2 F.3d

have authority to review state court decisions. “A basic precept of our federal system is that federal 
courts do not exercise authority over the proceedings of a sovereign state’s judiciary as it relates

SUMMARY 
Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, respectfully submits this Motion to Dismiss for 
Want of Prosecution and in support thereof states as follows: 
1. The Supreme Court of Texas, through its promulgated time standards, provides clear 
guidelines for the timely disposition of cases, including dissolution of marriage. 
2. The proposed time standards are based on national studies, including those conducted by 
the ABA and the NCSC, which establish a 12-month maximum time frame for divorce 
cases as achievable and reasonable, with intermediate standards for temporary orders, 
responsive pleadings, and trials. 
3. In this case, the time standards have been exceeded, with no substantial progress toward 
resolution or final disposition. 
4. Rule 165a (2) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure permits the dismissal of cases that 
are not disposed of within the prescribed time standards, ensuring the proper 
administration of justice and preventing undue delays caused by party inaction. 
FACTS SUPPORTING DISMISSAL 
5. Notwithstanding the above, the Petitioner’s Original Petition for Divorce in this matter 
and all subsequent pleadings submitted to the court bearing her signature should be 
stricken from the record because they are fundamentally fraudulent, and given the 
circumstances of the case, the Petitioner cannot prevail at trial, and granting a divorce

SUMMARY

Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, respectfully submits this Motion to Dismiss for

Want of Prosecution and in support thereof states as follows:

1.

The Supreme Court of Texas, through its promulgated time standards, provides clear
guidelines for the timely disposition of cases, including dissolution of marriage.
The proposed time standards are based on national studies, including those conducted by
the ABA and the NCSC, which establish a 12-month maximum time frame for divorce
cases as achievable and reasonable, with intermediate standards for temporary orders,
responsive pleadings, and trials.
In this case, the time standards have been exceeded, with no substantial progress toward
resolution or final disposition.
Rule 165a (2) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure permits the dismissal of cases that
are not disposed of within the prescribed time standards, ensuring the proper
administration of justice and preventing undue delays caused by party inaction.

FACTS SUPPORTING DISMISSAL
Notwithstanding the above, the Petitioner’s Original Petition for Divorce in this matter
and all subsequent pleadings submitted to the court bearing her signature should be
stricken from the record because they are fundamentally fraudulent, and given the
circumstances of the case, the Petitioner cannot prevail at trial, and granting a divorce
under the current circumstances would prove detrimental to the Respondent, and the
children.
The Petitioner’s submissions include an affidavit of inability to pay, an original divorce

petition, and a protective order. These documents were leveraged to secure the current

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
temporary orders which claim to be agreed despite lacking the Respondent’s signature 
and were prepared by an attorney not authorized to represent the Petitioner. 
7. The Respondent has raised claims of fraud, perjury, deception, and child neglect against 
the Petitioner, and her counsel has failed to address, defend, or file any response 
regarding these claims.  
8. The Respondent has submitted discovery and admissions which have not been responded 
to by the opposing party, and despite filing a motel to compel discovery, no action has 
been taken by the court. 
9. The opposing counsel’s authority has been under challenge pursuant to Rule 12 of the 
Texas Rules of Civil Procedure since September 20th, 2024, yet she was permitted to 
attend the recusal hearing and raise objections despite no indication of her position on the 
motion prior to the hearing.  
10. The opposing counsel is unable to file anything on her client’s behalf in this matter 
because her electronic filing manager account is registered under her former employer’s 
email.  
11. The opposing counsel has not filed any documents on her client’s behalf in this matter but 
has rather had individuals unrelated to the case file documents for her on her behalf. 
12. The opposing counsel is unable to file the required notice of remand with the clerk of the 
court, and the case is unable to proceed given these circumstances. 
FURTHER STATUTORY PROVISIONS WARRANTING DISMISSAL 
Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, asserts that the Petitioner has violated Sec. 
12.002 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. Specifically:

=== PAGE 15 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
13. Petitioner knowingly made and presented fraudulent claims to the Court regarding 
Respondent's property, with the intent to deprive him of his interest in his home, a 
property essential for his ability to work and provide for the children. 
14. Petitioner acted with the intent that these false claims be given the same legal effect as 
valid court orders, misleading the Court and causing Respondent to be wrongfully 
deprived of his home and livelihood. 
15. The Respondent, as the person directly affected by this fraudulent conduct, reserves the 
right to bring a cause of action under Sec. 12.003(a)(8) as an equal owner to the 
community property impacted by the Petitioner’s fraudulent claims. 
16. Petitioner’s actions have caused significant harm, including: 
1. Financial injury resulting from the loss of property and work opportunities. 
2. Mental anguish and emotional distress caused by being deprived of his home 
and stability. 
17. Given the Petitioner is unable to account for the damages she has caused, the court should 
impose the appropriate sanctions for the following reasons: 
i. For signing multiple fraudulent documents which she knew to be false, 
including the affidavit of inability to pay and original petition for divorce 
filed December 18, 2023, the Application for Protective Order filed 
December 22, 2023, and the current temporary orders prepared by her 
current unauthorized attorney, which should be stricken from the docket 
pursuant to Rule 12 given that they are not agreed.

Petitioner knowingly made and presented fraudulent claims to the Court regarding

Petitioner acted with the intent that these false claims be given the same legal effect as

The Respondent, as the person directly affected by this fraudulent conduct, reserves the
right to bring a cause of action under Sec. 12.003(a)(8) as an equal owner to the

Petitioner’s actions have caused significant harm, including:

1. Financial injury resulting from the loss of property and work opportunities.

2. Mental anguish and emotional distress caused by being deprived of his home

and stability.

Given the Petitioner is unable to account for the damages she has caused, the court should
impose the appropriate sanctions for the following reasons:

i. For signing multiple fraudulent documents which she knew to be false,
including the affidavit of inability to pay and original petition for divorce
filed December 18, 2023, the Application for Protective Order filed

current unauthorized attorney, which should be stricken from the docket

ii. For failing to take her court-ordered parenting class, which permits the 
court to issue an appropriate sanction pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code § 
105.009(g). 
iii. For putting her own selfish agenda before her own children’s future and 
emotional stability , disregarding them entirely 
iv. For any other actions or inaction taken by the Petitioner in this matter. 
 
CONCLUSION AND PRAYER 
18. In conclusion, this case should be dismissed as a matter of law. It has yet to be 
adjudicated fairly in over a year, exceeding the Texas Supreme Court guidelines. It further was 
founded on fraud, including an affidavit of inability to pay, making the case dismissible pursuant 
to the Tex. Prac. Rem. Code Sec. 13.001. Finally, given the fundamentally flawed decisions 
made in this case in regard to the children – the current situation damages their well-being, and a 
re-assessment of the facts are needed for the court to properly adjudicate this matter. 
 
Therefore, the respondent respectfully requests that this honorable court: 
i. Dismiss this case without prejudice and impose the appropriate sanctions on 
the Petitioner. 
ii. Adopt the emergency temporary orders filed by the Respondent in September 
of 2024 which reflect the reality of the current situation and preserves the 
status quo of the children in accordance with Texas law. 
iii. Provide clear, written instructions in the dismissal order permitting the 
Respondent to return to 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, TX giving the Petitioner

Hello, 
This is Charles Dustin Myers, Petitioner in the above captioned cause, and I received an automated reply deferring me to
this email when originally reaching out to the Honorable Coordinator.
The original email's purpose was to inform the Honorable Coordinator that I had just received notification through the EFM
that the emergency ex-parte TRO had been accepted by the court.
I am following up to inquire about the status of the request.
I thank you for your attention to this urgent matter, and I will wait for further directive from the court to proceed accordingly.
As mentioned in the motion, the Respondent in this matter and her counsel of record have been duly notified of the relief
being sought and the motion itself, but have not responded to any attempts to communicate regarding this urgent matter.
Thank you and have a wonderful evening.

Again, all of these points have been argued in both courts, and it is her duty as counsel to handle these matters in
accordance with Texas Law.
These matters should be handled between the parties - not attempt to influence court staff after hours.
The reason we are here in the first place is due to the above unanswered facts. Ms. Carter has had ample time to file an
objection, response, or counter argument, but has chosen not to do so.
It would've been far more appropriate for Ms. Carter to have reached out to me directly to discuss scheduling conflicts.
Prior to the latest email, there was no indication Ms. Carter intended to participate at all despite being provided with all
relevant materials.
The court should disregard this email correspondence in its entirety for the reasons stated herein as it is highly prejudicial
to Petitioner and the children.
Pro se litigants are expected to follow the rules of procedure to the same extent licensed attorneys are.
This email chain should be disregarded in its entirety.
Have a good evening.

Good morning,
Mr. Myers appeared before me to schedule the hearing for the TRO; my apologies I did not realize this was that
same case.  We can go ahead and set the TRO with us, but most likely the case will be transferred prior to the
hearing date and the case needs to be transferred prior to that date.
Mr. Myers will be emailing with dates available for the hearing.
