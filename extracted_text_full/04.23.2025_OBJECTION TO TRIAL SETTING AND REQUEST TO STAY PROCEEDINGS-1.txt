Current issues 
 
Currently, there are several issues that remain unaddressed that need to be resolved: 
1. The entire case foundation is fraudulent due to Petitioner’s pleadings. 
2. The undersigned has sought relief from this situation since March 14, 2024, 
when the original orders issued on January 16, 2024, which removed the 
undersigned from his home without the required findings, were leveraged into 
a settlement agreement that was not consented to by all of the parties and did 
not serve the best interests of the children. 
3. COOPER L. CARTER’s authority remains in question, and her inactivity 
combined with the ambiguity surrounding her representation must be 
addressed. 
4. The undersigned has been forced to live in transient housing and incur 
extraordinary damages to his business operations due to the Petitioners 
fraudulent allegations which were never supported by evidence. 
5. The children in this matter continue to suffer ongoing and irreparable harm 
from being separated from their father unjustifiably. 
6. There is no child support set up for the children. 
Informal service 
 
Furthermore, the court continues to issue notices informally through the court 
coordinator, which is improper. 
Pursuant to Texas Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 21a, service of a notice via email 
directly, rather than through the electronic filing manager (EFM), does not constitute proper

Current issues

Currently, there are several issues that remain unaddressed that need to be resolved:

1. The entire case foundation is fraudulent due to Petitioner’s pleadings.

2. The undersigned has sought relief from this situation since March 14, 2024,
when the original orders issued on January 16, 2024, which removed the
undersigned from his home without the required findings, were leveraged into
a settlement agreement that was not consented to by all of the parties and did
not serve the best interests of the children.

3. COOPER L. CARTER’s authority remains in question, and her inactivity
combined with the ambiguity surrounding her representation must be
addressed.

4. The undersigned has been forced to live in transient housing and incur
extraordinary damages to his business operations due to the Petitioners
fraudulent allegations which were never supported by evidence.

5. The children in this matter continue to suffer ongoing and irreparable harm
from being separated from their father unjustifiably.

6. There is no child support set up for the children.

Informal service

Furthermore, the court continues to issue notices informally through the court

coordinator, which is improper.

Pursuant to Texas Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 21a, service of a notice via email

directly, rather than through the electronic filing manager (EFM), does not constitute proper

service if the email address is on file with the EFM. Texas courts have consistently held that 
electronic service must be made through the EFM when the recipient's email address is 
registered there. The undersigned’s email is registered with the EFM. 
Conclusion 
 
Because the undersigned has an email on file with the EFM, there is no court order 
requiring alternative service, and there is no agreement waiving formal service, any notice of 
court proceedings not in compliance with rule 21a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure is 
improper.  
 
Furthermore, because there are several issues that remain unaddressed, such as COOPER 
CARTER’S authority, the ongoing mandamus proceedings, the ongoing irreparable harm to the 
children, and the facially void orders which have caused detrimental effects to the undersigned, 
the risk of these issues creating future delays remains high. 
 
The undersigned is prepared to challenge any adverse actions taken against him in the 
face of these issues and will seek relief until this matter is resolved in accordance with the 
principles of fairness and justice. The undersigned requests that the court stay all future 
proceedings until the above matters are resolved. 
 
Respectfully submitted,
