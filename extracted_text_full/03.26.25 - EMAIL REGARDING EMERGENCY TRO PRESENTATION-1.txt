Hello, 
This is Charles Dustin Myers, Petitioner in the above captioned cause, and I received an automated reply deferring me to
this email when originally reaching out to the Honorable Coordinator.
The original email's purpose was to inform the Honorable Coordinator that I had just received notification through the EFM
that the emergency ex-parte TRO had been accepted by the court.
I am following up to inquire about the status of the request.
I thank you for your attention to this urgent matter, and I will wait for further directive from the court to proceed accordingly.
As mentioned in the motion, the Respondent in this matter and her counsel of record have been duly notified of the relief
being sought and the motion itself, but have not responded to any attempts to communicate regarding this urgent matter.
Thank you and have a wonderful evening.
Respectfully,
Charles Dustin Myers
