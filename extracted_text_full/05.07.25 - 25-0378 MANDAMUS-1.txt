Statement of the Case 
Nature of the Underlying Proceeding 
and Order Complained Of 
 
This is an original proceeding seeking 
a writ of mandamus to compel the 
Honorable Kenneth Newell, Presiding 
Judge of the 233rd Judicial District 
Court, Tarrant County, Texas, to vacate 
his order dated April 11, 2025. This 
order granted a contested motion to 
consolidate Relator’s Suit Affecting the 
Parent-Child Relationship (SAPCR), 
Cause No. 233-765358-25, with a first-
filed divorce proceeding, Cause No. 
322-744263-23, pending in the 322nd 
Judicial District Court of Tarrant 
County. 
 
Respondent Judge 
The Honorable Kenneth 
Newell, District Judge, 233rd 
Judicial District Court, Tarrant 
County, Texas. His office is 
located at the Family Law 
Center, 200 E. Weatherford St., 
5th Floor, Fort Worth, TX 
76196-0230. 
Respondent’s Challenged Actions:  
Respondent granted Real Party in Interest’s contested motion to consolidate the 
SAPCR (the later-filed case) into the divorce proceeding (the first-filed case). 
This order was issued sua sponte as to its timing and effect, without prior notice 
to Relator of an imminent ruling, without a hearing on Relator’s timely filed 
objections to the consolidation, and in direct contravention of Tarrant County 
Local Rule 4.01(8)(a), which mandates that consolidation motions be filed and 
heard in the earliest-filed case. 
Procedural History in the Court of Appeals 
 
Relator previously sought mandamus relief from the Second District Court of 
Appeals, Fort Worth, Texas, in Cause No. 02-25-00164-CV, challenging the 
Associate Judge’s refusal to hear his Emergency Temporary Restraining Order in 
the SAPCR. That petition was denied per curiam. The current petition for writ of 
mandamus arises from the consolidation order issued by Respondent moments 
after Relator filed the aforementioned mandamus in the court of appeals. Relator 
also has two pending mandamus in this Court, cause Nos. 25-0361 & 25-0367, 
related to the underlying divorce matter.

Introduction 
This Petition for Writ of Mandamus presents a case of profound and 
continuing injustice, compelling Relator, Charles Dustin Myers, to seek this 
Court’s extraordinary intervention. For over fifteen agonizing months, Relator has 
been ensnared in a procedural labyrinth, his fundamental parental rights 
systematically imperiled by a pattern of judicial actions that defy due process and 
the clear mandates of Texas law. This is not a mere disagreement with a 
discretionary ruling; it is a challenge to actions taken sua sponte, without notice, 
without hearing, and in direct contravention of established legal safeguards, 
culminating in an improper consolidation order that further entrenches the denial of 
Relator’s access to a fair and timely resolution of matters critical to his relationship 
with his children. This mandamus marks the third concurrent petition before this 
Honorable Court, and in totality, spell out a complete failure of the courts below to 
provide an adequate forum. 
The circumstances detailed herein are not only extraordinary but also 
represent an unprecedented disregard for the basic tenets of procedural fairness 
within the very system designed to uphold them. Relator has diligently pursued 
every available avenue to protect his rights and seek redress for the clear abuses of 
discretion by the 233rd and 322nd District Courts of Tarrant County. These efforts, 
however, have been met with a series of per curiam denials from the Second Court

Honorable Court, and in totality, spell out a complete failure of the courts below to
provide an adequate forum.

The circumstances detailed herein are not only extraordinary but also
represent an unprecedented disregard for the basic tenets of procedural fairness
within the very system designed to uphold them. Relator has diligently pursued
every available avenue to protect his rights and seek redress for the clear abuses of
discretion by the 233rd and 322" District Courts of Tarrant County. These efforts,

of Appeals, leaving Relator with no answers and without an adequate remedy by an 
appeal, resulting in continuous and ongoing irreparable harm. The challenged 
consolidation order, issued moments after Relator sought mandamus relief from the 
Court of Appeals concerning a related TRO denial, is the latest manifestation of a 
judicial course that appears determined to frustrate appellate review and perpetuate 
the denial of Relator’s rights. 
This Court’s intervention is not merely sought to correct a single erroneous 
order, but to address a situation where the lower courts’ actions, if left uncorrected, 
threaten to render Relator’s substantive parental rights meaningless and undermine 
public confidence in the integrity of the judicial process. The facts of this case cry 
out for the exercise of this Court’s mandamus power to uphold the rule of law, 
ensure fundamental fairness, and prevent the permanent loss of Relator’s most 
precious rights. This petition demonstrates a clear abuse of discretion for which no 
adequate appellate remedy exists, demanding this Court’s immediate and decisive 
action to restore due process and rectify a stunning departure from judicial 
propriety. 
A MOTION TO CONSOLIDATE these three mandamus petitions will be 
filed by May 8th, 2025, to provide this Court with the full context of this matter, the 
efforts put forth by the Relator, and to showcase the silence and lack of 
engagement from the opposing party and trial courts below.

STATEMENT OF FACTS 
 
This case arises from a deeply troubling sequence of procedural events in 
underlying family law matters involving Relator, Charles Dustin Myers, and his 
children. The facts, meticulously supported by the record, paint a picture of 
Relator’s persistent efforts to protect his parental rights and seek due process, met 
with actions by the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County and its Associate Judge 
that give rise to this petition. See In Re: Myers, No. 25-0367 (Tex. pending). 
On March 18, 2025, Relator initiated an original Suit Affecting the Parent-
Child Relationship (SAPCR), providing a comprehensive cover letter detailing his 
legal position. R. 1.0-1.18; R. 2.1-2.11. Accompanying this filing was an 
Application for Emergency Injunctive Relief, which outlined the series of events 
spanning from December 15, 2023, to the present day. R. 3.1-3.31. This 
application included numerous exhibits evidencing concerning issues such as bad-
faith actions by the opposing party, (R. 3.33-3.37) problematic third-party 
involvement (R. 3.38-R. 3.41), a decline in the eldest child’s academic 
performance, (R. 3.44-3.45) and signs of medical neglect concerning the youngest 
child R. 3.46-3.47. 
Despite months of inactivity in the first-filed divorce matter, the opposing 
party answered the SAPCR suit merely two days after its filing R. 4.1-4.5. Shortly

Despite months of inactivity in the first-filed divorce matter, the opposing

party answered the SAPCR suit merely two days after its filing R. 4.1-4.5. Shortly

thereafter, a motion to consolidate the SAPCR with the divorce case was filed by 
the opposing party in the 233rd District Court. R. 5.0-5.4 
In response to these developments and to protect his procedural rights, 
Relator moved to strike certain pleadings (R.6.1-6.10) and filed a Rule 12 motion 
against opposing counsel R. 7.1-7.14. No response was ever filed to these motions. 
Faced with ongoing harm and the urgent need to care for his children, Relator then 
filed for an Emergency Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) seeking to prevent the 
Real Party in Interest from barring the Relator from his residence. R. 8.1-8.31. See 
also R. 12.15. (Relator providing merits of TRO to opposing party) 
The attempt to secure a hearing on this critical TRO was summarily 
thwarted despite following proper procedure. R. 12.9; 12.12-12.13. Relator was 
denied the opportunity to even present his motion in the courtroom. Instead, he left 
with only the Court Coordinator’s initials regarding a hearing scheduled for April 
10, 2024, a hearing that was subsequently un-set by the Associate Judge without 
explanation or rescheduling. See In Re: Charles Dustin Myers, No. 02-25-00164-
CV; see also R.12.29. The decision to refuse to hear Relator’s emergency motion 
was based on an out-of-court statement made by opposing counsel, who was not 
even present in the courtroom at the time R.12.20. 
A forward-looking motion related to these matters was not filed by the 
opposing party until a week later, on April 3, 2025 R.13-13.2. Subsequently, the

Real Party in Interest from barring the Relator from his residence. R. 8.1-8.31. See
also R. 12.15. (Relator providing merits of TRO to opposing party)

The attempt to secure a hearing on this critical TRO was summarily
thwarted despite following proper procedure. R. 12.9; 12.12-12.13. Relator was
denied the opportunity to even present his motion in the courtroom. Instead, he left
with only the Court Coordinator’s initials regarding a hearing scheduled for April
10, 2024, a hearing that was subsequently un-set by the Associate Judge without
explanation or rescheduling. See Jn Re: Charles Dustin Myers, No. 02-25-00164-
CV; see also R.12.29. The decision to refuse to hear Relator’s emergency motion
was based on an out-of-court statement made by opposing counsel, who was not
even present in the courtroom at the time R.12.20.

A forward-looking motion related to these matters was not filed by the

opposing party until a week later, on April 3, 2025 R.13-13.2. Subsequently, the

12

opposing party attempted to have a motion signed by the court without addressing 
Relator’s timely filed objections R.12.31, an attempt Relator was forced to rebut 
R.12.32. No further correspondence was received from opposing counsel on this 
matter. 
Having been denied a hearing on his emergency TRO, Relator formally 
informed the 233rd District Court of his intention to seek mandamus relief from 
the Second Court of Appeals regarding this outright denial (R.14-14.18) and 
provided a statement of facts recapping the situation. R.14.4-14.6. Relator then 
prepared and, on April 11, 2025, filed his petition for writ of mandamus with the 
Second Court of Appeals (See In re: Charles Dustin Myers, No. 02-25-00164-CV, 
challenging the TRO denial). 
In a striking turn of events, mere moments after Relator sought this appellate 
oversight, he was served with an order, signed by the Respondent Judge of the 
233rd District Court, granting the opposing party’s contested motion to 
consolidate. This consolidation order was issued sua sponte as to its timing and 
effect, without notice to Relator of any imminent ruling, without a hearing on the 
consolidation motion itself, and without addressing Relator’s timely filed 
objections to the consolidation R.15-15.1. Relator promptly moved for en banc 
reconsideration of the Second Court of Appeals' subsequent per curiam denial of

addressing Relator’s timely filed objections. The Respondent’s actions constitute a 
clear abuse of discretion for at least two fundamental reasons: first, the 
consolidation order directly violates Tarrant County Local Rule 4.01(8)(a), which 
mandates that consolidation motions be filed and heard in the earliest-filed case—a 
rule the Respondent had no discretion to ignore. Second, the denial of notice and 
an opportunity to be heard on a contested, potentially case-dispositive motion is a 
fundamental violation of due process. 
Relator lacks an adequate remedy by appeal. The improper consolidation, 
effected under highly prejudicial circumstances (including the prior refusal of the 
Associate Judge to hear Relator’s emergency TRO and the suspicious timing of the 
consolidation order itself, issued moments after Relator sought mandamus relief 
from the Court of Appeals concerning the TRO denial), creates extraordinary 
circumstances. Forcing Relator to proceed through trial based on this voidable 
order would result in wasted judicial and personal resources, subject Relator to 
ongoing irreparable harm concerning his fundamental parental rights, and present 
insurmountable difficulties in demonstrating harm on appeal from proceedings 
tainted by such clear procedural error. The consistent per curiam denials by the

Argument

Mandamus relief is an extraordinary but essential remedy to correct clear
abuses of discretion by a trial court when no adequate appellate remedy exists. Jn
re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 135-36 (Tex. 2004) (orig.

demanding this Court’s intervention to prevent manifest injustice and uphold the
integrity of judicial proceedings.

I. Standard for Mandamus review.

Mandamus relief is available where the trial court’s error “constitute[s] a
clear abuse of discretion” and the relator lacks “an adequate remedy by appeal.”
Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 839 (Tex. 1992) (orig. proceeding). A trial court
clearly abuses its discretion if it reaches a decision so arbitrary and unreasonable as
to amount to a clear and prejudicial error of law, or if it clearly fails to analyze or

law correctly will constitute an abuse of discretion.” Id. Both elements for 
mandamus relief are met here. 
II. Respondent clearly abused his discretion when he granted a contested 
consolidation motion sua sponte, without notice, without a hearing, and in 
clear violation of local rules. 
 
The actions of the 233rd District Court, through its Presiding Judge, 
Respondent, constitute a clear and reversible abuse of discretion for at least two 
fundamental reasons: first, the consolidation order directly violates mandatory 
Tarrant County Local Rules, and second, the manner of its issuance—sua sponte, 
without notice to Relator, without a hearing, and without addressing Relator’s 
timely filed objections—is a profound denial of fundamental due process. 
A. Extraordinary circumstances exist warranting mandamus review 
While mandamus typically does not lie from a trial court’s consolidation 
order because such orders usually do not threaten a party’s substantial rights, this 
Court has recognized that “if an ordinary appeal is inadequate because 
extraordinary circumstances exist, mandamus relief may be appropriate.” In re Van 
Waters & Rogers, Inc., 145 S.W.3d 203, 210-11 (Tex. 2004) (orig. proceeding). 
Extraordinary circumstances are present when the appellate remedy is inadequate 
because, inter alia, “the party is in danger of permanently losing substantial 
rights,” “the error cannot be cured on appeal,” or “the party’s ability to present a 
--- OCR TEXT ---
law correctly will constitute an abuse of discretion.” /d. Both elements for
mandamus relief are met here.

Respondent, constitute a clear and reversible abuse of discretion for at least two

A. Extraordinary circumstances exist warranting mandamus review

While mandamus typically does not lie from a trial court’s consolidation
order because such orders usually do not threaten a party’s substantial rights, this
Court has recognized that “if an ordinary appeal is inadequate because
extraordinary circumstances exist, mandamus relief may be appropriate.” Jn re Van
Waters & Rogers, Inc., 145 S.W.3d 203, 210-11 (Tex. 2004) (orig. proceeding).

rights,” “the error cannot be cured on appeal,” or “the party’s ability to present a

viable claim or defense is vitiated.” Id. at 211. Such circumstances are manifest 
here.  
The Tarrant County Local Rules are unequivocal. Local Rule 4.01(8)(a) 
mandates that “every motion to . . . consolidate . . . shall be filed in the earliest-
filed case and the motion shall be heard in the earliest-filed case.” (emphasis 
added). This rule is not merely advisory but a directive ensuring orderly case 
management and has the force of law. See In re Christus Spohn Hosp. Kleberg, 222 
S.W.3d 434, 437 (Tex. 2007) (orig. proceeding) (trial courts are required to follow 
local rules). Here, the underlying divorce matter (Cause No. 322-744263-23), 
pending in the 322nd District Court, is the first-filed case. The SAPCR (Cause No. 
233-765358-25) was filed later in the 233rd District Court. Despite the clear 
mandate of Local Rule 4.01(8)(a), and the fact that the consolidation motion was 
filed in both Courts, Respondent in the 233rd District Court (the later-filed case) 
granted the motion. This action directly contravenes the local first-filed rule, an act 
for which the trial court had no discretion. Walker, 827 S.W.2d at 840. 
B. The respondent had no discretion to violate local rules or deny due process. 
 
Furthermore, Respondent granted the consolidation motion sua sponte as to 
its timing and effect, without providing Relator notice or an opportunity for a 
hearing on his timely filed objections. This deprived Relator of his fundamental 
right to due process. A trial court has no discretion to ignore or misapply clear local

rules or to deny a party due process. See In re J.B. Hunt Transp., Inc., 492 S.W.3d 
287, 299-300 (Tex. 2016) (orig. proceeding) (due process requires notice and an 
opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner). The 
Respondent’s decision to grant consolidation in the later-filed case, particularly 
under these circumstances—sua sponte, without notice or hearing on Relator’s 
objections, and with the effect of centralizing proceedings before a court that had 
previously demonstrated a reluctance to afford Relator emergency relief—
constitutes a clear abuse of discretion. The timing and manner of this 
consolidation, occurring immediately after Relator sought mandamus relief from 
the Associate Judge’s refusal to hear his TRO, strongly suggests that this 
procedural maneuver was intended to circumvent appellate oversight and further 
entrench the existing denial of Relator’s access to justice. 
III.
Relator lacks an adequate appellate remedy.
An appellate remedy is inadequate when a party is in real danger of losing
substantial rights, Perry v. Del Rio, 66 S.W.3d 239, 257 (Tex. 2001) (orig. 
proceeding), or when the trial court’s error is such that it cannot be effectively 
cured on appeal, potentially leading to wasted judicial resources and irreparable 
harm to the litigant. See In re McAllen Med. Ctr., Inc., 275 S.W.3d 458, 469 (Tex. 
2008) (orig. proceeding); In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 148 S.W.3d at 136.

In this case, the Respondent’s sua sponte consolidation order, issued without 
notice, hearing, and in violation of local rules, presents precisely such a scenario. 
Relator’s substantial rights, particularly his fundamental parental rights and his 
right to a fair process in the determination of those rights, are directly imperiled. 
The improper consolidation forces Relator to litigate critical issues concerning his 
children in a procedural posture tainted by clear legal error and apparent judicial 
resistance to affording him due process. Forcing Relator to endure a full trial under 
these circumstances, only to argue on appeal that the consolidation was improper, 
is not an adequate remedy. The prejudice from such a procedurally flawed 
consolidation, especially in a sensitive family law context involving custody of 
children, is difficult to quantify and may be impossible to fully “untangle” on 
appeal. See Dal-Briar Corp. v. Baskette, 833 S.W.2d 612, 616 (Tex. App.—El Paso 
1992, orig. proceeding) (noting difficulty in showing harm from improper 
consolidation after trial). 
Furthermore, the history of this case, including the prior denial to hear a 
motion requesting emergency relief based on ex parte communications and the 
pattern of per curiam denials from the appellate court without substantive review, 
demonstrates that ordinary appellate processes have thus far failed to provide 
Relator with a meaningful opportunity to be heard or to correct clear abuses of 
discretion. The challenged consolidation order is not an isolated incident but part

of a continuing course of conduct that effectively denies Relator due process and 
access to justice, specifically his ability to protect his relationship with his 
daughters and ensure their well-being. Waiting for a final appeal would subject 
Relator to further irreparable harm, including the continued deprivation of his 
parental rights and the significant expense and burden of a trial predicated on a 
voidable order. This Court has recognized that mandamus is appropriate to spare 
parties and the public the expense of a trial and appeal when the trial court’s ruling 
is a clear abuse of discretion that an appellate court would likely correct. See In re 
USAA, 307 S.W.3d 299, 314 (Tex. 2010) (orig. proceeding). The circumstances 
here cry out for such intervention to prevent further injustice and the needless 
expenditure of judicial and personal resources on proceedings founded upon clear 
and prejudicial error. 
CONCLUSION 
For the reasons stated, Respondent clearly abused his discretion by granting 
the contested consolidation motion sua sponte, without notice, without a hearing, 
without addressing Relator’s objections, and in violation of Tarrant County Local 
Rules. Relator lacks an adequate remedy by appeal due to the extraordinary 
circumstances presented and the inability of a final appeal to cure the prejudice 
caused by these procedural violations. Relator respectfully requests that this Court 
grant his Petition for Writ of Mandamus.

PRAYER FOR EXPEDITED RELIEF 
For the foregoing reasons, Relator respectfully requests that this Honorable 
Court: 
i. Grant this Petition for Writ of Mandamus; 
ii. Reverse or vacate the Second Court of Appeals’ per curiam denial of 
mandamus relief issued in Cause No. 02-25-00171-CV 
iii. Issue a writ of mandamus directing the 233rd District Court of Tarrant 
County, Texas, Honorable Kenneth Newell presiding, to vacate the Order
