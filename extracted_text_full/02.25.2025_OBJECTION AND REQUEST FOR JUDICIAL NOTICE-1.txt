I. INTRODUCTION

What incentive does this Court have, if not to uphold the
very laws it is sworn to enforce, to restore long-overdue justice in
this matter? How many unopposed motions must be filed, and how
much procedural entanglement must be endured, before
substantive relief is granted? This case hinges on a purported
settlement agreement that plainly lacks the required consent of
both parties, leaving no valid mutual assent. Yet procedural barriers
and administrative mishandling have thwarted any genuine review

of these issues.

Before this Court can even see the motion, it must pass
through the same administrative staff whose conduct has hindered

the proper adjudication of this dispute. In particular, the

Coordinator Lindsey Baker—who has already mishandled crucial 
aspects of recusal proceedings—in any further handling of

judicial review, the undersigned, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, 
remains unjustly delayed in receiving the relief this Court is well 
within its authority to provide.

8. The aforementioned laws have been grossly neglected by this
court, and rather than providing justice, it is being actively denied. 
IV. ARGUMENT
A. The Court Coordinator Lacked Legal Authority to Handle
the Recusal Filings 
 
 
 
1. Coordinators Have No Independent Authority Over Filing
or Docketing.
Under Texas Government Code §§ 74.101–74.106, a court
coordinator’s role is strictly administrative: maintaining the
judge’s docket, scheduling hearings, and other nonjudicial
tasks. In contrast, the clerk of the court is the official
custodian of court filings, responsible for receiving, filing,
and preserving all pleadings.
2. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 21(f)(11) explicitly states
that once a document is e-filed in accordance with the rules,
the clerk “may not refuse to file” it, even if it fails to
conform perfectly. There is no mention of a coordinator
having any parallel authority.

“the clerk may not refuse to file a document that fails to conform

8. The aforementioned laws have been grossly neglected by this

court, and rather than providing justice, it is being actively denied.

IV. ARGUMENT

A. The Court Coordinator Lacked Legal Authority to Handle

the Recusal Filings

1.

Coordinators Have No Independent Authority Over Filing
or Docketing.

Under Texas Government Code §§ 74.101—74.106, a court
coordinator’s role is strictly administrative: maintaining the
judge’s docket, scheduling hearings, and other nonjudicial
tasks. In contrast, the clerk of the court is the official
custodian of court filings, responsible for receiving, filing,
and preserving all pleadings.

Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 21(f)(11) explicitly states
that once a document is e-filed in accordance with the rules,
the clerk “may not refuse to file” it, even if it fails to
conform perfectly. There is no mention of a coordinator

having any parallel authority.

3. As explained in the facts, Court Coordinator Lindsey Baker
took it upon herself to “modify” the Joint Motion to
Recuse, omitting the sworn affidavit and exhibits from the
version that was apparently sent to the Regional Presiding
Judge. Such an act goes beyond any permissible
administrative function and constitutes a direct interference
with court records and is a criminal offense in Texas.
4. Coordinators Are Not Granted a Role Under TRCP 18a
Motions to recuse are governed by Rule 18a of the Texas
Rules of Civil Procedure, which specifically names the
clerk of the court, the respondent judge, and the regional
presiding judge—not a court coordinator.
5. Rule 18a(e): The clerk “must immediately deliver a copy”
of the filed recusal motion to the respondent judge and
regional presiding judge. This duty is the clerk’s alone, not
the coordinator’s.
6. Rule 18a(f): The respondent judge has three business days
to act—either recuse voluntarily or refer the motion to the
regional presiding judge. Again, no role is assigned to a
coordinator for screening, modifying, or distributing the
document.
7. Unauthorized Alteration of Filings Can Constitute
Tampering.

By “splicing” the motion after pointing out the modified 
submission, Baker created what amounts to a false or 
incomplete record for official purposes. Texas Penal Code 
§ 37.10(a) prohibits knowingly making a “false entry in, or 
false alteration of, a governmental record” and intentionally 
“impairing the availability” of that record. 
8. Because court filings fall within the definition of 
“governmental record” in Penal Code § 37.01(2), Baker’s 
unilateral modifications raise serious concerns under the 
tampering statute, as well as potential violations of due 
process. 
9. Accordingly, any action Baker took regarding the 
recusal motion was ultra vires (beyond lawful authority) 
and compels the Court to acknowledge that the filing 
process was improperly subverted. 
 
 
B. The failure to properly File and Refer the Recusal 
Motion Violates TRCP 18a 
10. The Respondent Judge’s Strict Three-Day Obligation 
Rule 18a(f)(1) imposes a mandatory duty on a judge who is 
the subject of a recusal motion: within three business days 
of the motion’s filing, the judge must either sign an order of 
recusal or sign and file an order referring the motion to the 
regional presiding judge. Failing to comply is more than a

The rule unequivocally requires the judge to file the order

Clerk’s Non-Discretionary Duty Under TRCP 21

Once a motion is e-filed, the clerk must file-stamp and note

to reject or modify a filing based on substantive content.
There is still no trace of the originally submitted Joint

Recusal motion found on the re:Search Texas platform.

18. TRCP 21(f)(11): “The clerk may not refuse to file a 
document that fails to conform to these rules.” Thus, even if 
there were perceived technical issues (e.g., file size), the 
correct remedy is for the clerk to notify the filer, not to alter 
the motion or remove exhibits and then give false 
statements as to the intentions behind the alteration.
19. Coordinator Interference Does Not Relieve the Clerk of 
Responsibility
Even if the coordinator allegedly modified the filing or gave 
instructions, the clerk’s statutory obligation remains. If the 
clerk allowed the coordinator’s altered version to replace 
the original in official communications with the regional 
judge, that constitutes a serious breakdown of mandated 
processes and a violation of the court’s duty to maintain 
accurate records.
20. Presumption of Prejudice
Given the importance of a recusal motion and the 
requirement of impartiality, any interference with the 
filing is presumed prejudicial to the party seeking recusal. 
The undersigned was effectively denied the protections of 
due process, including the right to have his motion heard on 
the complete merits with all supporting exhibits and 
affidavits.

The undersigned has a constitutional right to an impartial 
judge, guaranteed by Article I, Section 19 of the Texas 
Constitution (due course of law) and the Fourteenth 
Amendment of the U.S. Constitution (due process). When a 
litigant files a motion to recuse, the rules serve as a 
safeguard for that right. Subverting these procedures 
equates to subverting due process.
22. Active Denial of Justice
The undersigned remains unjustly barred from relief, as the 
central issue—lack of valid consent in the purported 
settlement—has never been legitimately addressed. Instead, 
it is tangled in administrative gatekeeping that contravenes 
multiple provisions of state law. “Justice delayed is justice 
denied,” and the repeated mishandling of filings amounts to 
an active refusal to apply the law.

To remedy these violations, the Court must order the clerk

other pleadings, especially those that are time-sensitive and

handling of recusal or other critical motions. The

be entitled, whether to address any ongoing interference, to 
provide injunctive relief ensuring fair access to the Court, 
or to sanction improper conduct that has obstructed the 
administration of justice. The Regional Presiding judge 
who is overseeing this matter not only has the legal 
discretion to issue interim orders pursuant to TRCP 18a, but 
a legal obligation considering the circumstances. 
V. PRAYER FOR IMMEDIATE RELIEF
WHEREFORE, based on the foregoing legal arguments and 
applicable authorities, the undersigned respectfully urges this 
Court to: 
27. Recognize that the recusal motion was improperly withheld
and altered by the court coordinator;
28. Direct the clerk to immediately file and docket the
complete, unaltered Joint Motion to Recuse with all
exhibits and affidavits;
29. Enjoin any further unauthorized modifications or
interference by non-clerk personnel; and
30. Grant such other and further relief as the interests of justice
and due process require without a hearing and with specific
instructions permitting the undersigned to return to his
home at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Tx, 76148.
 
Only until then can justice be served in this matter and the best interests of the 
children upheld.
