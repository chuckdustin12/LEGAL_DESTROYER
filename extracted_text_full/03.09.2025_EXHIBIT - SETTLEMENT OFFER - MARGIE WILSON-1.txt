Mr. Branthoover,
The time has come for you to be held fully accountable for your egregious actions that have significantly damaged the
well being of my daughters, caused significant damages to my business, and have left a case so fundamentally flawed
that the only possible outcome is for a dismissal, which has already been filed.
This is going to be your only opportunity to settle outside of court, so I highly recommend you set your ego aside and pay
attention, because the reality of your actions will lead to significant consequences in a court of law, and you've admitted to
the actions outlined below yourself, including welcoming this lawsuit against you.
Your response to this email is unnecessary, and if one is received, it will be taken as an unwillingness to take this offer,
and I will proceed with litigation without further notice.
If you feel you have a defense for your actions, then you will need to present it in court, not here, and you may ignore this
email.
Here's the facts:
1. On December 14th, 2023, at 3:29 A.M., you began messaging Morgan Michelle Myers. You sent a total of 92 text
messages throughout the day, which totals more than all messages exchanged for the prior two years. 
2. On December 14th, 2023, Morgan attempted to get an emergency ex-parte order of protection under your directive
when no emergency situation existed.
3. When this attempt didn't work, you then devised a scheme where you invited Morgan to stay at your residence located
at 6100 Copan Ct., Yukon, Oklahoma, over the weekend of December 15, 2023.
4. On December 15, 2023, you reached out to me using your cellular phone number 940-312-3434, and claimed that "
[you] want to help both of us" regarding a recent divorce announcement made by Morgan on December 1st, 2023, and
asked for me to call you. I replied that "I wanted to fix this more than anything in the world" and called you using my
cellular phone number 817-507-6562.
5. Directly following that phone call, you directed Morgan to transfer $1,576 from our joint marital bank account to your
PayPal account with the intent to hide the final destination of the funds and conceal Morgan's bank account information.
Bank statements and text messages confirm this to be true.
6. On December 16, 2023, I was notified that our bank account was overdrawn by $-800 the weekend before Christmas,
and I texted you and requested the funds be returned, informing you that the funds were for bills and for the girls'
Christmas presents.
7. Rather than return the funds, you decided to unveil the true intention behind why you wanted Morgan to visit your
residence - which by your own words - was to "help with the paperwork" and that I was "getting divorced", a stark
contradiction to your initial claim of "wanting to help both of us."
8. While at your domicile, you assisted Morgan in acquiring a second phone, a can of pepper-spray mace, and confirmed
via text message that "the money is in her account that you said was hers."
9. You then proceeded to assist Morgan in preparing a statement of inability to afford court costs, an original petition for
divorce, and through discovery it will be determined if you assisted in the protective order as well.
10. The statement of inability to afford court costs was knowingly fraudulent, as it clearly misrepresented Morgan's
financial obligations. Furthermore, considering you and Morgan both admit via text message evidence that you transferred
money to her account, the deliberate misrepresentation of Morgan's financial status will be apparent when I present my
payment history showing that I was responsible for the family finances leading up to the divorce announcement.

11. The original petition for divorce, also fraudulent, was filed under oath claiming financial indigency. Furthermore, the 60-
day waiting period for divorce was waived due to the claim that an active order of protection was already in effect and that
the order had found family violence occurred during the marriage. You and Morgan both knew this statement was
materially false, and proceeded to present it to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant county alongside the statement of
inability to afford court costs on December 18, 2023.
12. On December 17, 2023, I was served an eviction notice by Margie Evonne Wilson claiming a protective order had
been filed against me, which didn't happen until December 22nd, 2023.
13. Once filed, you then proceeded to text me and claim to be Morgan's legal representative, referring to her as "[your]
client" on December 19, 2023. You then proceeded to claim that "you have never lied to me", "lets get the decree written
up and move on with our lives" showing your clear involvement in my marital affairs you had no business meddling in.
14. On December 22, 2023, Morgan filed for another protective order despite claiming to already have one in effect in the
divorce petition. Text and image evidence will show Morgan at the home that evening taking care of the children with me,
laughing and playing - clearly in no emergency.
15. These fraudulent documents were relied upon by the court when I was unlawfully removed from the residence located
at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, TX 76148 on January 16, 2024.
16. You proceeded to mock and harass me throughout my attempts at seeking relief in the second court of appeals,
showing malicious intent.
17. You welcome this lawsuit against you as text message evidence will clearly show.
18. Your latest threat in December of 2024, where you stated "When this is over, you get to deal with me." showcases
your disregard for your actions and further showcases malicious intent.
Here's the reality:
1. You have caused significant emotional and psychological damage to my children by playing a part in my abrupt removal
from their lives.
2. As originally pointed out, you have helped Morgan conceal a marital affair between herself and Damen Kazlauskas, a
third party outside of the marriage that she exchanged over 6,500 text messages with leading up to the divorce.
3. My children are now being raised by Meme and Papaw, not their parents, and this is due to your carelessness.
4. You have devastated my business operations, costing me over $100,000 in damages and future business opportunity
losses from being unable to work in a stable home environment with reliable internet.
5. My children are now being medically neglected by Morgan, Mara is starting to struggle in school, and your criminal
history showcases this behavior as a character flaw rather than "trying to protect someone" as you have previously
claimed.
If you think you have a defense for the above actions, simply do not reply, and I look forward to hearing it in court. This is
your only opportunity to settle this outside of court, or I will be pursuing damages to the full extent that the law
permits, and will be requesting a bifurcated jury trial for punitive damages to deter similar behavior in the future.
The case has already been established in the Western District of Oklahoma and is awaiting my request for service, which
will be submitted on Thursday, March 13th, 2025, at 1:00 P.M. CST if you do not accept the following terms:
1. You will send via PayPal the $1,576 you converted on December 15, 2023 by the deadline mentioned above.
2. You will inform Morgan of the severity of the actions you both have committed and restore stability to my
children's lives and my life by taking the first step in doing the right thing and have her call me on my cellular
phone number at 817-546-3693 to have a real conversation about how we are going to proceed.
3. You will stop interfering in my divorce matter moving forward, and will return to being the loving, caring Dan Dan
that my daughters love and appreciate instead of furthering Morgan's conspiracy to conceal her marital affair.

That's it dan. That's all I'm asking of you. I'm asking you to step up, be a man, and do the right thing, or face the
consequences. I'm giving you this opportunity because I told the court that I would, and despite everything that's
happened, I am able to forgive so long as you meet me halfway.
This is me meeting you halfway.
Again, do not reply to this email. I will know if you accept the terms without the necessity of a response. I am not
interested in having a conversation with you. I am only interested in doing what's best for my children - and the situation
you have helped create is destroying the very fabric of their life.
If a reply is even seen come in my inbox from you, I will immediately take it as you reject the terms of this settlement and
will proceed to have you served by the U.S. Marshall or alternative service if necessary.
When Mara and Caroline grow up, this decision before you here will determine if you're the man who helped destroy their
family, or the man who helped repair it.
If Morgan wants a divorce, she must do it the right way.  This was not the right way to handle it Dan, and you know that.
For what it's worth - take care.
