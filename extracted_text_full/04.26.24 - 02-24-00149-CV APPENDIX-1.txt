Background Report for Case Consolidation

Case Details:

Divorce Case (Cause No. 322-744263-23) in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County, filed on
December 18, 2023.

Protective Order Case (Cause No. 322-744538-23) in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County.

Reasons for Consolidation:

Interconnected Issues:

The divorce case and the protective order case involve overlapping issues concerning family violence
allegations, which are central to the divorce proceedings and directly affect custody and visitation rights.
The protective order case includes allegations of family violence, which are also a pivotal point in the
divorce case in determining the waiver of the standard waiting period for the divorce.

Consistency in Rulings:

Consolidating the divorce and protective order cases would ensure consistency in the court's findings,
particularly regarding any allegations of family violence and their impact on the dissolution of marriage,
custody, and visitation rights.

Judicial Economy:

Hearing both cases together would promote judicial economy by avoiding duplication of legal
proceedings, as both cases are likely to involve similar witnesses, evidence, and legal arguments.

Claims of False Statements:

There have been claims of false statements and perjury related to the protective order, which could have
significant implications for the divorce case. For instance, the claim that the plaintiff intentionally lied
about being unable to pay court fees and made false allegations of family violence to gain an advantage
in the divorce proceedings suggests that a single judge should hear both matters for a clear
understanding of the facts.

APP 8:2
--- OCR TEXT ---
Evidence of Misrepresentation and False Statements:

Evidence provided suggests that there have been misrepresentations to the court, including the transfer
of funds from the joint account and the plaintiff's interaction with third parties, which could affect both
the protective order and the divorce outcome. The protective order — which was based on claims of
family violence — are entirely baseless as | have no record of family violence, and no evidence from the
Plaintiff has been provided to substantiate these claims.

Landlord-Tenant Relationship:

The eviction case, although not directly related to family law matters, stems from claims and actions that
are deeply intertwined with the divorce and protective order cases, suggesting that the alleged family
violence and the actions of the plaintiff have been used to justify an eviction that coincides with the
timing of the divorce and protective order filings.

Conclusion:

Given the overlapping factual and legal issues in the divorce and protective order cases, consolidation
would serve the interests of justice and efficiency. It would ensure that the court has a comprehensive
understanding of the intertwined nature of the family's circumstances, which is vital for fair and
equitable resolution of these matters. While the eviction case may not be directly consolidated due to
jurisdictional differences, it should be considered in context with the other cases to provide a complete
picture of the ongoing disputes and to keep the best interests of our children intact.

CAUSE NO. 322-744538-23

MOTION FOR CONTINUANCE

TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT:

Comes now Charles Dustin Myers, Defendant in the above-entitled and numbered cause, respectfully
requests that the Court grant a continuance in the protective order case, and as grounds therefore would
show the following:

1, Family Priorities During Holidays: The recent holiday season and the children's break from school
have been my priority. Ensuring their stability and spending quality time with them has been of
utmost importance, impacting my ability to prepare adequately for this case.

2. Motion for Consclidation: | have recently filed a motion for consolidation to combine this case
with two others due to their intertwined nature. This motion has been accepted by the court but
not yet ruled upon by the judge. A decision on this matter could significantly impact the
proceedings of this case. The relevant cases that are intertwined are cause numbers: 322-
744263-23 (DIVORCE) and JPO01-23-E00102017 (EVICTION).

3. Unfounded Claims in Eviction Suit and Protective Order: Both the eviction suit and the protective
order claims are unfounded. The eviction suit lists the violation of the lease as "granddaughter
divorced" and prematurely references the protective order as a secondary reason for eviction
grounds. Additional time is needed to address these premature and baseless claims. There is no
immediate danger to the Plaintiff, or the children — and has never been any incident of family
violence that has occurred within our home. Attached is a copy of my criminal history obtained
by the Texas Department of Public Safety that highlights my clean record.

4. Time to appropriately answer the divorce: The parent case in the request to consolidate is the
divorce, which | have yet to answer due to the concurrent proceedings (eviction suit and
protective order) which were both filed due to the claims that | possess a history of family
violence, waiving the 60-day period for service and making the timeframe unreasonable —
especially considering the lack of communications from the Plaintiffs — to formulate a plan that
best suits our children’s interests.

5. Lack of Cooperation in Providing Lease Agreement: Despite requests, the Plaintiff has not
provided a copy of the lease agreement necessary for my defense. More time is needed to
acquire these critical documents, especially given the unlawful nature of the eviction.

6. Potential for Amicable Resolution: Given more time to prepare and the pending decision on the
consolidation of cases, there is a potential for a more amicable resolution to be reached. The
intertwined nature of the cases suggests that a holistic approach to resolution may be more
appropriate and beneficial for all parties involved.

Considering the above reasons, continuity is necessary to ensure a fair and just resolution of this matter.
| assure the Court that this request is not for the purpose of delay, but to allow for adequate preparation
and the pursuit of justice.

WHEREFORE PREMISES CONSIDERED, |, Charles Dustin Myers, respectfully request that the Court grant a
continuance for the protective order case.

Respectfully submitted,

Car aer
harles Dustin Myers

STATEMENT 
I, Charles Dustin Myers, submit this unsworn declaration to recount the events since
December 1st, 2023, when my wife, Morgan Michelle Myers, unexpectedly declared
her wish for a divorce. The announcement was not only ill-timed but also perplexing in
its lack of substantiated reasoning or opportunity for reconciliation.
At noon that day, Morgan cited 'the way I talk to her' as her rationale for the divorce.
Despite her evolving reasons, I extended apologies and exhaustively sought resolution,
yet my every attempt to discuss our daughters' future and our family's welfare was met
with hostility or outright dismissal by Morgan.
The abruptness of Morgan's hostility compelled me to seek deeper insight. Upon
examining our AT&T records, I found an alarmingly high volume of communication
between Morgan and two individuals: Debbie and Damen. These findings were
troubling, especially given the children's scant interaction with Debbie's family despite
Morgan's extensive evening visits. When presented with this evidence, Morgan
downplayed its significance and persisted in her communications and visits, placing
them above resolving our marital issues.
After sharing my concerns with her grandparents, our landlords, the dynamics shifted
abruptly. Within days, Morgan began to systematically exclude me from the family
narrative surrounding the divorce.
The situation intensified on December 14th, 2023, with the involvement of Dan
Branthoover, her mother's boyfriend. Dan contacted me, purporting to mediate our
divorce impartially, yet his subsequent actions—advising Morgan, facilitating a transfer
of funds from our account to his PayPal, and overdrawn our joint account—belied his
stated intentions. This financial maneuvering, coupled with Dan's claim that Morgan is
"his client," despite lacking a legal license in Texas, underscores a deceitful
manipulation of the facts.
Morgan's subsequent visit to Dan's in Oklahoma for the divorce petition preparation
and the acquisition of a second phone coincided with a conspicuous halt in her
communications with Debbie, Dan, and Damen, as evidenced in the AT&T records.
On December 17th, 2023, I was served an eviction notice by Morgan's grandmother—a
notice that cited a divorce and a protective order not yet filed, revealing a preconceived
strategy to undermine my paternal rights and disrupt our daughters' stability,
particularly before the Christmas season.
The subsequent protective order filed on December 22nd, 2023, and the divorce

paint a unilateral narrative of events. Throughout this ordeal, Morgan has actively
excluded me from our daughters' lives and neglected to pursue employment or engage
in any dialogue regarding their future.
Conversely, I have remained steadfast in my parental duties, inviting Morgan to
participate in our daughters' lives, only to be rebuffed at every turn. Her behavior and
legal actions, which starkly contradict her claims of fear, suggest an attempt to evade
accountability rather than protect herself from any purported threat.
The chain of events illustrates a concerted effort by Morgan and her family to extricate
me from our home, leveraging unfounded legal allegations and an eviction suit without
considering the facts or the impact on our daughters.
It is my firm belief that Morgan's actions are self-serving, aimed at avoiding
responsibility for her actions rather than safeguarding our children. Hence, I implore
this court to recognize the inconsistencies in Morgan's claims and to view subsequent
allegations with a discerning eye, considering their strategic nature.
In conclusion, I respectfully request the court to deny the protective order and impose
sanctions on Dan Branthoover for his role in the marital discord that has ensued since
the announcement. It is essential for our daughters' stability and well-being that the full
truth of this matter be brought to light and considered in these proceedings.

NATURE OF SUITS AND THIRD-PARTY INFLUENCE 
1. On December 1st, 2023, Petitioner announced the divorce with no plan in place for the
children, no sign of marital discord leading up to this point to warrant such a decision,
and no desire for counseling, communication, and no consideration for the time of year.
2. Between December 1st, 2023, and December 12th, 2023, all efforts are exhausted in an
attempt to communicate with the Petitioner which lead to the subsequent discovery of an
alarming volume of text messages that were directed towards two individuals – Debbie
Price and Damen Kazlauskas, showing a significant level of influence.³
3. On December 12th, 2023, After the discovery of the communications between these two
individuals combined with the irrational behavior from the Petitioner during such a
critical time of year, I reached out to the Petitioner’s grandfather via text message.⁴
4. On December 13th, 2023, Petitioner states she will be going to talk to her Grandparents
alone. This conversation lasts between 9:55 and 1:30 A.M.
5. On December 14th, 2023, Petitioner filed for an Emergency Protective Order. This order
was denied by the court.
6. On December 15th, 2023, Petitioner involves her family into the situation.
Particularly, Dan Branthoover became involved. He is the boyfriend of the Petitioner’s
Mother. Shortly thereafter, I received a notice from our joint bank account stating that
$1,576 had just been withdrawn. As our bank statement for December 2023 will
demonstrate – the transaction record shows the funds being transferred directly to Mr.
Branthoover’s PayPal account.⁵

FRIVOLOUS CLAIMS AND FALSE STATEMENTS
A. EMERGENCY PROTECTIVE ORDER
1. As mentioned above, Petitioner filed for an Emergency Protective Order on
December 14th, 2023. This protective order was denied by the courts. 
2. Due to the fact this order was not granted by the court, one could conclude that
there was not a clear and present danger of family violence.¹ 
B. THE DIVORCE PETITION
1. Petition was filed on 2024-12-18 under an Affidavit of Inability to pay.²
2. The Petitioner's action of filing for divorce under an Affidavit of Inability to pay
three days after transferring $1,576 to herself starkly contravenes the mandates 
set forth in Chapter 10, Section 10.001 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code. This 
section asserts that each claim or legal contention must be warranted by existing 
law or a nonfrivolous argument for the modification of existing law or the 
establishment of new law, and that each factual contention has or is likely to have 
evidentiary support after further investigation or discovery³. 
3. The Petitioner violated Chapter 10, Section 10.001 a second time within the
same document when she intentionally elected to waive the 60-day waiting 
period claiming to have an active protective order against me that found family 
violence had occurred during our marriage⁴ despite being denied such an order
just five days prior on December 14th, 2023.  
5. The final page of the Divorce Petition for service to the Office of the Attorney
General was left unsigned by the Petitioner.

C. EVICTION SUIT
1. The suit was unlawful by nature⁵, as the grounds for eviction were based on
family status, referencing the divorce as well as a protective order that had been 
denied on December 14th, 2023. The suit was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction on 
January 17th, 2024.⁶ 
D. PROTECTIVE ORDER
1. This suit was the second attempt by the Petitioner to have me removed from
the home, which ultimately succeeded. 
2. The claims within this suit mentioned sexually aggressive comments and
threatening behavior. These allegations are materially false, as the Petitioner 
possesses no evidence, and has presented no evidence in relation to these claims 
since the initiation of the suit. Despite this, as video and image evidence will show 
once a fair trial date is set, the Petitioner and I continued to maintain stability at 
our family home and preserved the sense of normalcy that our daughters have

The Court's decision to remove me from my home and my children’s lives on January 
16th, 2024, albeit preliminary and unjustified, bypassed the safeguarding of the children's 
emotional, psychological, and physical well-being. This oversight is compounded by the 
Petitioner's actions. The juxtaposition of the Court's decision against the backdrop of the 
Petitioner's inattention to the children's needs illuminates a disconcerting disregard for the 
paramount principle that custody determinations should primarily serve the children's best 
interests. The final section of this motion will highlight the procedural aspects of the events 
unfolding between the dates of January 16th, 2024, and February 1st, 2024, and pray the court

C. EVICTION SUIT

1. The suit was unlawful by nature®, as the grounds for eviction were based on
family status, referencing the divorce as well as a protective order that had been
denied on December 14", 2023. The suit was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction on
January 17", 2024.«

D. PROTECTIVE ORDER

1. This suit was the second attempt by the Petitioner to have me removed from
the home, which ultimately succeeded.

2. The claims within this suit mentioned sexually aggressive comments and
threatening behavior. These allegations are materially false, as the Petitioner
possesses no evidence, and has presented no evidence in relation to these claims
since the initiation of the suit. Despite this, as video and image evidence will show
once a fair trial date is set, the Petitioner and I continued to maintain stability at
our family home and preserved the sense of normalcy that our daughters have
been accustomed to their entire lives up until January 16", 2024.

The Court's decision to remove me from my home and my children’s lives on January
16", 2024, albeit preliminary and unjustified, bypassed the safeguarding of the children's
emotional, psychological, and physical well-being. This oversight is compounded by the
Petitioner's actions. The juxtaposition of the Court's decision against the backdrop of the
Petitioner's inattention to the children's needs illuminates a disconcerting disregard for the
paramount principle that custody determinations should primarily serve the children's best
interests. The final section of this motion will highlight the procedural aspects of the events
unfolding between the dates of January 16", 2024, and February 1%, 2024, and pray the court
will rectify this situation by restoring the stability to our family by vacating the current
temporary orders that are in place until a proper investigation can be completed by the courts.

THE PROTECTIVE ORDER HEARINGS 
1. In preparation for the Protective Order hearing on January 16th, 2024, I filed with the
Court an answer to the Protective Order on January 2nd, 2024 as well as two motions – a
motion to consolidate the divorce with the protective order, filed on January 4th, 2024, as
well as a motion of continuance, filed on January 8th, 2024 for the purpose to acquire
counsel due to the complex nature of the case.¹ All three filings were accepted by the
court.
2. On January 16th, 2024, both parties sought additional time to secure legal
representation. Despite not reviewing any evidence, witness testimonies, or documents
related to the motions, and acknowledging the denial of a previous Emergency Protective
Order, the court mandated my departure from our home within four hours. This
decision, unexpectedly made, awarded custody to the Petitioner, overlooking my
concerns about the adverse effects on our children and my work from home. This ruling,
which both parties did not sign, set the case to resume on January 22nd, 2024, to allow
time for obtaining counsel.²
3. Following the court's directive, I relocated to my father's residence in Flower Mound until
the subsequent hearing. During this interval, the Petitioner did not take the initiative to
have the children call once and did not provide any information as to how they were
doing, showcasing her lack of empathy and concern for our children’s well-being and
stability. After incurring substantial expenses to secure representation, I detailed my case
and concerns to my attorney, preparing for the next court appearance.
4. On January 22nd, 2024, the Petitioner chose to seek legal representation just minutes
before the hearing was due to start, indicating a disregard for the process. My lawyer
recommended agreeing to a continuance, thereby extending the period I couldn't work
and impacting our established family dynamics. This resulted in a third hearing being set
for February 1st, coinciding with my birthday, and a second rendition being ordered.³

5. On February 1st, 2024, during the third hearing, the substantive issues I had raised were
not addressed, nor was there any exchange of evidence between our legal representatives. 
Despite the focus of the hearing supposed to be on the protective order, the discussions 
veered into custody and child support matters. My lawyer presented the sole option of a 
temporary return to the family home for 30 days with expanded visitation rights, coupled 
with a child support obligation starting in April. This outcome, which diverged significantly 
from the case's core issues, compelled me to reconsider my legal representation. 
Consequently, I decided to terminate my attorney's services and embarked on drafting this 
motion myself, aiming to bring the court's attention back to the pivotal elements of the case 
that had thus far been neglected while able to legally reside in my home. 
CONCLUSION AND PRAYER 
In conclusion, this motion has laid bare the stark realities and procedural aberrations that have 
marred the essence of justice and due process in the matter of Cause No. 322-744263-23. 
Through the course of these proceedings, it has become abundantly clear that the actions taken 
by the Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, have not only disregarded the welfare and best 
interests of our children but have also illuminated her unfitness as a parent. Her actions speak 
to a pattern of deceit, manipulation, and an unsettling willingness to leverage the judicial 
system for personal vendettas, all at the expense of the emotional and psychological well-being 
of our children. 
The court, in its decisions, inadvertently facilitated this troubling trajectory by removing me, 
Charles Dustin Myers, from the lives of our children based on unsubstantiated claims and 
without due consideration of my role as a devoted and stable parent. This oversight has not 
only disrupted the lives of our children but has also significantly impaired my ability to provide 
for them, casting a long shadow over their future stability and welfare. 
Moreover, the conduct of my Counsel involved has further compounded these issues, 
demonstrating a distressing disregard for the intricate dynamics and facts of this case. This has 
culminated in a situation where the paramount importance of the children's best interests and 
the fundamental principles of fairness and justice have been overshadowed by procedural 
missteps and a lack of thorough investigation into the Petitioner's fitness as a parent.

Therefore, it is with a heavy hearted yet unwavering resolve that I implore the Court to take 
immediate and decisive action to rectify these wrongs. Specifically, I respectfully request the 
Court to: 
1. Vacate the existing temporary orders that unjustly removed me from my home and
separated me from my children, restoring the status quo ante until a thorough and
unbiased evaluation of the facts can be conducted, as the Texas Constitution requires. If
left as it stands, these orders will further compound the issues at hand, and will
exacerbate the chaos introduced into the children’s lives.
2. Set a fair hearing date to delve into the substantive issues at hand, ensuring that all
parties are given an equitable opportunity to present their case and that the best
interests of our children are placed at the forefront of all considerations.
3. Scrutinize any response or new claims from the Petitioner or her counsel with the utmost
diligence, given the established pattern of deceitful and manipulative behavior exhibited
by the Petitioner throughout these proceedings.
4. Consider awarding me full custody of our children, ensuring their continued access to a
stable, nurturing environment, and the consistent provision of their needs, which I am
fully committed to upholding. Furthermore, in alignment with my enduring belief in the
importance of both parents in the lives of our children, I pledge to facilitate and
encourage a healthy, constructive relationship between the children and their mother,
provided she demonstrates a genuine commitment to their well-being and stability.
5. In seeking these remedies, I do so not out of vindictiveness but from a place of deep
concern for the welfare of our children and a steadfast belief in the principles of justice
and fairness. Despite the pain and turmoil of these proceedings, my ultimate desire is for
peace and the best possible outcome for all parties involved, most importantly, our
children. It is my sincere hope that the Court will recognize the gravity of the situation
and act in a manner that prioritizes the well-being of our children, ensuring their return
to a life marked by stability and love.
I affirm under penalty of perjury that all claims herein are true and accurate to the best of my

Dan, I'm going to need you to put the money back that i need
to pay our bills and clear my account deficit.

| move money around all the time, which is evident in the
transaction records and has always been in the best interest
of all of us.

This most recent move was malicious and manipulative, and
has negatively impacted our financial situation.

You should be trying to help resolve this - not further
complicate it.

| can't order any presents this weekend for the girls.

| can't work due to mental anguish - also not good for the
girls.

All I've done is try to explain that we should work on this -
especially when you look at the
facts versus the narrative.

Morgan needs insurance on the car. My own insurance is
now late. Water bill is late- which threatens our auto-pay
setup.

Despite not understanding any of this and none of it making
sense - | still have to do what's in the best interest for
Morgan and the girls, as | always have so long as | was
aware of what | needed to be working on.

There's still time to turn this around - hash it out, and realize
that this family and those two girls and everything we've
done are worth fighting for.

I'll keep trying until | can't.

We can still save Christmas.

v. 
Respondent's Answer to 
Petitioner's First Amended 
Petition for Divorce 
Charles Dustin Myers, 
Respondent 
To the Honorable Judge of said Court: 
The First Amended Petition for Divorce presents yet another series of critical flaws and 
misrepresentations, reflective of the pattern established in every document filed thus 
far by the opposing Party.¹ 
Respondent has firmly denied the allegations herein in multiple documents within the 
court’s possession, including an answer to the Protective Order, alongside several 
Exhibits with supporting documentation. Particularly, the Counter Petition for divorce, 
which more accurately reflects the true nature of the best interests of our children and 
does not contain false information or inaccuracies aimed at gaining an unfair 
advantage, has yet to be considered.  
Based on the forthcoming inaccuracies, the false allegations, and the clear oversight 
by Counsel, the Respondent moves the Court to reset Cause No. 322-744263-23 which 
would immediately restore stability to the children’s lives, give all parties involved 
time for an appropriate conference, and to follow the court procedures properly, and 
effectively, which would serve the best interests of our daughters. 
¹ Between December 14th, 2023, and December 22nd, 2023, the Petitioner filed for an Emergency 
Protective Order, a Divorce Petition, a Protective Order, and instigated an Eviction suit. Please see the

INACCURACIES OF PETITION/DENIAL 
This section of this document will reference the corresponding numbered sections 
found in the First Amended Petition for Divorce. 
6. Dates of Marriage and Separation
1. December 1st, 2023, is not just inaccurate; it is a blatant
misrepresentation of our living situation. Our cohabitation, verified by 
multiple documents accepted by this Court, continued unabated, 
reflecting a conscientious effort to preserve normalcy for our daughters 
during an especially sensitive time. The date of separation came on 
January 16th, 2024 – without a hearing, which has been detrimental and 
the focal-point of these proceedings by the Petitioner. 
7. Grounds for Divorce
2. Petitioner claims the marriage became insupportable due to discord or
conflict of personalities. This is inaccurate. The divorce was announced 
without any prior attempt at counseling, communication, therapy, or any 
visible signs of marital discord around the holiday season.  
8. Children of the Marriage
3. The petition inaccurately asserts that no court-ordered
conservatorships, guardianships, or relationships affecting the children 
of this marriage were in place at the time of filing, which is another 
blatant inaccuracy and oversight. 
4. At the time of filing, orders were in place based on false claims from
the Petitioner, hindering my work and damaging the relationship with 
my children. Opposing counsel was appointed on or around January 
22nd, 2024, on last minute notice, which lead to a case continuance – 
which extended the Temporary Orders currently in place at that time to 
the reset date of February 1st, 2024.

6. The  request for the exclusive right to designate the primary residence
of the children is detrimental, as the Petitioner is employed part-time 
and has no desire to acquire full time employment and has 
demonstrated a pattern of deception that has destabilized the children's 
lives and damaged my ability to provide for them, which directly 
impacts them. 
7. This oversight shows the consequences of not conducting proper
discovery by opposing Counsel, and that this case is deeply rooted in 
misinformation, while the facts have been ignored outright. 
11. Request for Temporary Orders and Injunction
8. The requests outlined in this section are baseless and appear designed
to harass and complicate co-parenting. Cohabitation was maintained for 
45 days post-divorce announcement, disrupted only by court 
intervention on false pretenses. Once again, the opposing Party must 
maintain the need for protection despite cohabiting without court 
intervention for 46 days, during which I was served three times. 
Respondent would ironically argue that the protection would have made 
more sense if been filed by himself rather than the Petitioner. 
13. Request for Temporary Orders Concerning Use of Property

Protective Order was denied, and was filed maliciously, illustrating the 
baselessness of claims for protection. The cohabitation achieved 
aforementioned directly contradicts the need for such orders.  
15. Request for Temporary Orders Concerning Use of Property
11. Petitioner's Counsel requested temporary orders despite orders
already existing at the time of this filing. These requests were made 
without any hearing and are, therefore, just as all other allegations 
made in this document, based off of unfounded claims of Family 
Violence. 
16. Attorney's Fees, Expenses, Costs, and Interest
12. Respondent challenges the necessity and purpose of the Petitioner
securing legal services from Cooper L. Carter, as she expressed her lack 
of desire to represent the Petitioner for the divorce case, only seeming 
interested in the Protective Order case, and would question her desire to 
represent the Petitioner had it not been required by the Honorable 
Judge of this Court, as corroborated by the oversights pointed out within 
this document. 
17. Prayer
13. Petitioner's prayer, based on temporary injunctions and orders, is
plagued by inconsistencies and contradictions, with no regard for the 
children's well-being. This is further compounded by the lack of 
competence from the opposing Counsel to get crucial facts such as the 
living arrangements in line 6. 
RESPONDENT’S PRAYER 
Respondent, Charles Dustin Myers, affirms under penalty of perjury that the 
statements herein are true and accurate to the best of his knowledge, supported by 
substantial documentation and evidence duly filed and accepted by the clerk of this

It is with utmost respect yet resolute conviction that Respondent prays for the Court to

Therefore, Respondent earnestly requests that the Court grant the following relief: 
1. Reset the case to restore the conditions prior to court intervention.
2. Set a fair and expedited hearing to address these matters thoroughly, ensuring
all parties can present their case and the children's best interests are held
paramount. Respondent suggests a hearing date for March 14th, 2024 as the
Opposing Counsel has already disclosed this availability, and the Court has
already set time aside for this date in regards to the EMERGENCY MOTION
filed, as referenced on page 1 of this document.
3. Consider the pattern of deceit and manipulation exhibited by the Petitioner
throughout these proceedings, and the operation of non-facts by opposing
Counsel, and weigh any new claims with a heightened level of scrutiny, as
Respondent has retained consistent pleadings throughout this case.
4. Award full custody to the Respondent, who is best positioned to meet the
children's needs and provide a stable, nurturing environment, while also
facilitating a constructive relationship with the Petitioner.
5. Respondent reassures the Court that reinstating him to the family home and
with full custody of his children poses no risk of harm or violence; on the
contrary, it promises the continuation of peaceful cohabitation and the
nurturing environment his daughters need. The Petitioner retains the right to
remain in the home or choose alternate accommodations, but it is imperative
for the children’s sake that their lives not be disrupted by ongoing litigation
over baseless allegations.
6. The Respondent will make an active and conscious effort to ensure the bond
between the Petitioner and the children is upheld and is committed to ensuring
that the children have unfettered access to both parents, a principle the
Petitioner has willfully neglected. Awarding the Respondent custody will enable
the children to sustain the stable and loving home they are accustomed to,
without the unnecessary upheaval that has marked recent months.

IN THE 322nd DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY 
STATE OF TEXAS 
Morgan Michelle Myers, 
Cause No. 322-744263-23 
Petitioner, 
v. 
RESPONDENT’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL 
SUMMARY JUDGEMENT 
Charles Dustin Myers, 
Respondent 
Pursuant to Rule 166a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure¹, the Respondent, Charles 
Dustin Myers, firmly seeks a partial Summary Judgment in regard to the upcoming 
hearing scheduled for March 14th, 2024. He categorically asserts that the evidence on file 
with the Court definitively demonstrates there is no genuine issue as to any material fact 
related to the allegations against him which have led to his unwarranted removal from 
his home, significantly disrupted his business operations, and unjustly granted the 
Petitioner full custody of their children and possession of the family home on a 
temporary basis. 
The Respondent has meticulously and persistently contested the baseless allegations of 
family violence that have unjustly prejudiced the custody resolution to the detriment of 
the children's interests. The absence of substantive evidence supporting these claims has 
been made clear through detailed submissions.²  This unwarranted influence on custody 
¹ Rule 166a specifically allows for summary judgment when "the pleadings, depositions, answers to 
interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine 
issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." This 
provision is utilized here to highlight the lack of factual dispute regarding the allegations of family 
violence which have led to the continuation of unlawful temporary orders currently in place. 
² Submissions on record filed by the Respondent: Motion of Continuance (granted), Motion of 
Consolidation (granted), Protective Order Answer (ignored), Counter Petition for Divorce (ignored), 
Motion of Withdrawal for Attorney (granted), Emergency Motion of Reconsideration of Evidence and to 
Vacate Temporary Orders (Scheduled for March 14th, 2024). See attached EXHIBIT A.

Petitioner,

RESPONDENT’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL
SUMMARY JUDGEMENT
Charles Dustin Myers,

Respondent

Pursuant to Rule 166a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure!, the Respondent, Charles
Dustin Myers, firmly seeks a partial Summary Judgment in regard to the upcoming
hearing scheduled for March 14", 2024. He categorically asserts that the evidence on file
with the Court definitively demonstrates there is no genuine issue as to any material fact
related to the allegations against him which have led to his unwarranted removal from
his home, significantly disrupted his business operations, and unjustly granted the
Petitioner full custody of their children and possession of the family home on a
temporary basis.

The Respondent has meticulously and persistently contested the baseless allegations of

family violence that have unjustly prejudiced the custody resolution to the detriment of
the children's interests. The absence of substantive evidence supporting these claims has
been made clear through detailed submissions.2 This unwarranted influence on custody

1 Rule 166a specifically allows for summary judgment when "the pleadings, depositions, answers to
interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine
issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." This
provision is utilized here to highlight the lack of factual dispute regarding the allegations of family
violence which have led to the continuation of unlawful temporary orders currently in place.

2 Submissions on record filed by the Respondent: Motion of Continuance (granted), Motion of
Consolidation (granted), Protective Order Answer (ignored), Counter Petition for Divorce (ignored),
Motion of Withdrawal for Attorney (granted), Emergency Motion of Reconsideration of Evidence and to
Vacate Temporary Orders (Scheduled for March 14", 2024). See attached EXHIBIT A.

arrangements negate the principles of fairness and due process. The subsequent 
dismissal of the Protective Order suit not only vindicates the Respondent but also 
invalidates the current custody orders, revealing that the initial award of custody was 
grounded solely in unsubstantiated claims of family violence.³
BACKGROUND 
The documents on record filed by the Respondent, by virtue of their acceptance, 
inherently meet the threshold for self-authentication, thereby bolstering the legal 
foundation for the requested partial Summary Judgment. Detailed herewith are the 
enumerated facts underpinning this motion:
1. On December 14th, 2023, the Petitioner sought an EX-PARTE Order of
Protection from the Court, which was judiciously denied, affirming the
absence of immediate threat or harm that warranted such an extraordinary
measure. Undeterred by this judicial determination, the Petitioner proceeded
to file for divorce on December 18th, 2023, misleadingly alleging the existence
of an active Order of Protection against the Respondent. This deliberate
misrepresentation constitutes not merely an attempt to skew the legal process
in the Petitioner’s favor but represents a flagrant abuse of the judicial system
designed to secure an undue advantage in the divorce proceedings, which has
ultimately been successful.
2. On December 22nd, 2023, the Petitioner initiated a subsequent application for
a Protective Order, forming the cornerstone of litigation since the initial
hearing on January 16th, 2024.
3. On January 16th, 2024, the Court rendered Temporary Orders which required
the Respondent to vacate his family home and give up custody of his children
on the presumption of family violence. The Court’s decision did not meet the
statutory requirements of the Texas Family Code, Sec. 6.502.⁴
³ The non-suit of the protective order entitles the Respondent to this Partial Summary Judgement as a 
matter of law, as there is now no genuine dispute over the baselessness of the allegations made against 
him which are the foundation of the current temporary orders in place. 
⁴ Sec. 6.502 mandates that a Court may make such a decision while a suit for dissolution of a marriage is
pending and on the motion of a party or on the court's own motion after notice and hearing. No hearing 
took place, and no reasonable notice was given prior to the decision rendered on January 16th, 2024.

4. On January 22nd, 2024, before the start of the reset hearing, the Petitioner
acquired legal counsel at the last minute, delaying the case further until the
reset date of February 1st, 2024.
5. On February 1st, 2024, both parties entered into an agreement which allowed
the respondent back into the home on a temporary basis, yet still awarded the
Petitioner with full custody of the children. The Respondent was given 30 days
per the agreement to remain in the home. Despite having the ability to stay
next door, and after dropping the Protective Suit that initiated and are the
foundation for this agreement, the Petitioner chose to stay with her friend 9
miles away and remove the children from their stable environment.
6. On February 5th, 2024, the Respondent discharged his Legal Counsel for failure
to address any of the issues mentioned herewith, and for failure to diligently
represent the Respondent, as no genuine effort was made to make the court
aware of these errors. The Protective Order suit was non-suited on this day,
invalidating the current agreement, and requiring by law that the Court reset
the case back to the status quo ante until a fair discovery process can be
conducted on relevant matters to the divorce proceeding, and restoring order
back into the lives of the Respondent and his Children.
7. The Petitioner's decision to reside outside the family home, despite alternatives
that would minimize disruption during this transitional period, is a deliberate
choice. This choice, made independently, should not facilitate the continuation
of unfounded claims that have since been dismissed. Such actions have unduly
influenced the living arrangements and well-being of the children at the heart
of this case.
8. The Respondent explicitly refrains from pursuing any sanctions or penalties
against the Petitioner, emphasizing instead a heartfelt plea for a reasonable
transition period. This adjustment period is advocated as crucial for
safeguarding the welfare of his children, himself, and the Petitioner, ensuring
their collective long-term well-being. Furthermore, the Respondent
underscores that the prevailing custody determinations were unjustly
predicated on unsubstantiated allegations of family violence—a point
underscored by the unequivocal dismissal of the Protective Order, which
confirms the absence of any contested material facts.

LEGAL BASIS 
The legal foundation for this Partial Summary Judgment is firmly rooted in the principles 
and mandates of the law, notably where the current temporary orders are predicated on 
unsubstantiated claims of family violence, for which no concrete evidence has been 
presented. This lack of evidence fundamentally challenges the integrity and validity of 
the orders affecting the lives and welfare of the children involved. The necessity for the 
court to vacate these orders and revert to the status quo ante is underscored by the 
following critical legal arguments: 
1 . Misalignment with Texas Family Code Sec. 105.001: 
1.1 The orders issued on January 16th, 2024, and continued on January 
22nd, 2024, starkly conflict with Texas Family Code Sec. 105.001, which 
unequivocally necessitates notice and a hearing prior to the issuance of 
such orders. This statute ensures that parties are given a fair opportunity to 
be heard, a fundamental aspect of due process, which was conspicuously 
absent in this case. 
2. Contravention of Texas Family Code Sec. 105.005:
2.1 The initial rendering of temporary orders on January 16th, 2024, did 
not adhere to Texas Family Code Sec. 105.005, requiring that court's 
findings be grounded in a preponderance of the evidence before making 
any child custody determination affecting the parent-child relationship. 
2.2 The absence of evidence from the Petitioner, juxtaposed with the 
disregard for the Respondent's timely submissions, underscores a 
significant deviation from this legal requirement. 
3. Violation of Texas Family Code Sec. 153.002:
3.1 The proceedings failed to prioritize "The best interest of the child," as 
mandated by Texas Family Code Sec. 153.002. This principle, deemed 
paramount in determining issues of conservatorship, possession, and 
access, was overlooked.

not adhere to Texas Family Code Sec. 105.005, requiring that court's
findings be grounded in a preponderance of the evidence before making
any child custody determination affecting the parent-child relationship.

2.2 The absence of evidence from the Petitioner, juxtaposed with the
disregard for the Respondent's timely submissions, underscores a
significant deviation from this legal requirement.

3. Violation of Texas Family Code Sec. 153.002:

3.1 The proceedings failed to prioritize "The best interest of the child," as
mandated by Texas Family Code Sec. 153.002. This principle, deemed
paramount in determining issues of conservatorship, possession, and
access, was overlooked.

3.2 The Respondent's work-from-home situation and the need for a

reasonable transition period to maintain his pivotal role in his children’s 
lives were disregarded, further exacerbating the impact of the Petitioner’s 
actions and the court’s decisions on the children’s stability and well-being. 
4. Equal Opportunity and Fair Hearing (Sec. 152.205 & Sec. 105.003):
4.1 The Texas Family Code Sec. 152.205 and Sec. 105.003 enshrine the 
necessity for equitable procedural rights, mandating that all parties are 
granted a fair opportunity for notification and a meaningful hearing. The 
Respondent’s ability to engage fully in the hearing process and to present a 
comprehensive defense was significantly impeded, a deviation from the 
due process envisaged by these statutes. Consequently, the temporary 
orders issued lack the foundational fairness that is central to the justice 
system and contravene the legal safeguards intended to ensure balanced 
participation by all parties in family law proceedings. 
5. Managing Conservatorship Considerations (Sec. 153.005 & Sec. 153.007):
5.1 In deliberations of conservatorship, Texas Family Code Sec. 153.005 
obligates the court to deliberate thoroughly on the child’s best interest, 
including the living circumstances and stability provided by the parents. 
Additionally, Sec. 153.007 advocates for the establishment of a mutually 
agreed parenting plan, prioritizing the child’s welfare and the continuity of 
their established routine. The current custodial provisions do not 
correspond with a collaboratively designed parenting plan that satisfies 
these essential criteria. Given the disproven allegations of family violence 
and the unnecessary protective measures imposed during this period of 
change, it is imperative for the Court to rescind these provisional measures. 
The immediate restoration of the status quo ante is crucial to uphold the 
children’s best interest, allowing for a planned and considerate period of 
adjustment that acknowledges the absence of any immediate risk or harm 
to their well-being and without disruption to the Respondent’s business 
operations at-home.

Below are the enumerated statements of fact with no genuine dispute of material fact 
that entitle the Respondent to this Partial Summary Judgement: 
1. The Petitioner has not provided any evidence of Family Violence.⁶ These claims
unjustly removed the Respondent from his home starting on January 16th, 2024
and significantly impaired his at-home business operations, and are the basis for
the current custodial arrangements which are unlawful and founded on false
claims.⁷
2. No basis exists for the current arrangements, as the Court has not considered the
best interests of the children throughout this case, but rather has operated solely
on the accusations of family violence, which are now non-suited.⁸
3. The deadline approaching March 1st to vacate, and the current custodial
arrangements are void of any lawful basis. Any custodial arrangements are
required to consider the best interests of the children involved.
4. Respondent’s parenting plan has been overlooked by the Court, filed January 6th,
2024.⁹
5. The Court’s basis for conservatorship was based solely on the claims of Family
Violence, which are now void.
6. The respondent is entitled to this Partial Summary Judgement as a matter of law,
which will rightfully restore the status quo ante given no genuine dispute of

Honorable Court to: 
1. Annul the current temporary custody and visitation arrangements premised on
allegations now proven to be baseless, taking into account the critical urgency
imposed by the Respondent’s work-from-home requirements and the ongoing
detriment to his familial relationships.
2. Recognize that the initial accusations of family violence, which underpinned
the imposition of these temporary measures, were not substantiated by
credible evidence. This failure has unjustly prejudiced the Respondent,
undermining his right to an equitable adjudication and rendering the imposed
measures legally untenable.
3. Acknowledge the absence of substantial evidence for the allegations levied
against the Respondent. Command a thorough reevaluation of both procedural
and substantive legal missteps observed in the prevailing proceedings, with a
view to rectifying the inequitable temporary orders that have adversely
impacted the Respondent’s familial and professional life.

In accordance with Rule 166a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule
60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, award relief predicated on
identifiable mistakes, errors, and the conspicuous lack of evidential foundation
for the accusations faced by the Respondent.

strictly with the principles of fairness, due process, and the paramount
interests of the children involved. This reorientation is essential to ensure the
administration of justice, uphold the Respondent’s inalienable right to a fair

EXHIBIT A: TEMPORARY VISITATION ADJUSTMENT PROPOSAL

Respondent: Charles Dustin Myers

Understanding the intricate nature of our family's current situation and the legal complexities involved, |,
Charles Dustin Myers, propose a thoughtful adjustment to the visitation schedule that aligns with our
cohabiting status and the abrupt changes brought about by the divorce announcement.

1. Co-habitation Acknowledgement:

It is acknowledged that both parents currently cohabit, which com plicates traditional custody
arrangements. Therefore, the immediate priority is to facilitate a transition where both parties can
establish their respective independent living and working arrangements without disrupting the children's
lives.

2. Transition Period:

Morgan's Employment: Provide Morgan with the necessary support and time to secure stable
employment, which is vital for her to contribute to the children's needs and establish her own residence.

Stable Housing for Charles: As | seek stable housing to maintain my significant role in our daughters'
lives, flexibility in visitation is essential to ensure | continue to fulfill my parental duties.

3. Work and Research Commitments:

The concurrent legal proceedings, particularly those based on unverified clai ms, demand a substantial
amount of my time for research and preparation to protect the children's wel l-being.

My ability to work has been affected by the proceedings, necessitating an adjustment in my day-to-day
routine to accommodate these new responsibilities.

4. Interim Custody Logic:

Continuity for Children: While we navigate these proceedings, it is critical to maintain stability and
continuity for our children. Any temporary custody arrangements should reflect the least disruptive path
for them.

Counseling and Mediation: | strongly advocate for counseling or mediation to reconcile and navigate the
divorce process, emphasizing the children's best interests rather than abrupt and contentious changes.

5. Court's Facilitation:

The court's facilitation in endorsing a temporary and flexible visitation framework is crucial. This
framework must account for the current living situation and the significant emotional and logistical
upheaval that the divorce proceedings have caused.

This proposal is made in the spirit of cooperation, with a focus on minimizing the impact of our marital
dissolution on our children. It is with a sincere hope that we can transition into a stable co-parenting
arrangement that keeps our children's welfare as the priority.

Petitioner, 
v. 
NOTICE AND UNSWORN DECLARATION 
Charles Dustin Myers, 
Respondent 
March 3, 2024 
Dear Clerk of the Court, 
This letter is submitted on behalf of the Respondent in the above-referenced case to 
provide the court with an update on the Respondent's efforts to uphold the well-being of 
the children under the current agreed arrangements pending review and to navigate the 
complexities of this case. The following reasons why it is impossible for the Respondent 
to vacate the family home under the current agreement pending review are as follows: 
1. Since the inception of the case, the Respondent's primary focus has been to reset
the status quo ante for the benefit of the children, ensuring their lives remain as
normal and uninterrupted as possible during this transitory period after it was
significantly disrupted beginning on January 16th, 2024. Despite the challenges
posed by the non-suited protective order and the dropped allegations of family
violence which were the foundations of all decisions made within this case, the
Respondent has respected the orders pending review, and has strived to provide a
stable and supportive environment for his children during his designated time, all
while planning a transition that best suits his children.
2. During the short amount of time the Respondent has been re-instated to his home,
the Petitioner has, on multiple occasions, entered the residence unannounced and
without prior consent, actions which stand in stark contrast to her prior requests
for protection which have governed this case.

3. The Petitioner has changed employers since the signing of the agreement.
4. Petitioner has relinquished custody of the children to the Respondent on multiple
days during her scheduled time, showcasing the Respondent’s ability to care for
his children at any time given his at-home work schedule specifically crafted to
ensure participation in every aspect of his children’s lives remains possible.
5. The Respondent must dedicate substantial time to researching and understanding
legal procedures to ensure compliance with court rules and to advocate effectively
for the best interests of his children. He is prepared to present all relevant facts
and evidence at the upcoming hearing on March 14th, should his partial summary
judgment not be accepted.
6. The Respondent has made efforts over the past 30 days to maintain normalcy for
his children, showcasing his dedication to their well-being. The Respondent has
maintained an amicable relationship with the Grandparents residing next-door,
allowing frequent access during his time with the children to visit and attend
church, maintaining normalcy and peace.
7. The choice to remain outside the home is a deliberate decision by the Petitioner
during the transition period. Self-hosting and advertising is an essential
requirement for my at-home operations, which is essential to maintain the quality
of life our children are accustomed to. Multiple alternative housing options are
available to the Petitioner, including the house next door.
The Respondent remains committed to following the court's directives and ensuring the 
best possible outcomes for his children. He appreciates the court's attention to these 
matters and is ready to provide further information or clarification as needed.

Issue: Considering the absence of concrete evidence indicating an immediate

decision to issue Temporary Orders on January 16th, January 22nd, and February 
1st—thereby excluding the Respondent from the family residence and severing 
his relationship with his children—constitute an abuse of discretion under Texas 
Family Code § 83.001 et seq., which necessitates clear evidence of danger for 
such emergency action, ultimately leading to a violation of the Respondent’s due 
process and infringement of constitutional and parental rights as outlined by the 
U.S. Constitution and Tex. Const. art. I, § 19, while also disregarding the 
children’s best interest as mandated by FAM § 153.002?

Issue: Considering the absence of concrete evidence indicating an immediate
risk of harm or abuse towards the petitioner or minor children, did the court’s
decision to issue Temporary Orders on January 16", January 22", and February
1‘\—thereby excluding the Respondent from the family residence and severing
his relationship with his children—constitute an abuse of discretion under Texas
Family Code 8 83.001 et seq., which necessitates clear evidence of danger for
such emergency action, ultimately leading to a violation of the Respondent’s due
process and infringement of constitutional and parental rights as outlined by the
U.S. Constitution and Tex. Const. art. I, § 19, while also disregarding the
children’s best interest as mandated by FAM § 153.002?

ISSUES PRESENTED 
1. Given evidence suggesting that the Petitioner fabricated allegations of
family violence to secure a tactical advantage in custody and divorce
proceedings, does this raise a significant legal question regarding the
adequacy of safeguards against misuse of protective orders, potentially
warranting a review of the court’s reliance on unverified claims in making
preliminary decisions affecting parental rights and access to children?
2. Considering the absence of concrete evidence indicating an immediate
risk of harm or abuse towards the Petitioner or minor children, did the
Court’s initial decision to issue Temporary Orders on January 16th, 
followed by January 22nd, and February 1st—thereby excluding the 
Respondent from the family residence and severing his relationship with 
his children—constitute an abuse of discretion lacking clear evidence of 
danger for such emergency action, ultimately leading to a violation of the 
Respondent’s due process and infringement of constitutional and parental 
rights, while also disregarding the children’s best interests? 
3. How can the Court remove one parent from the home without following
the mandated process required by law, resulting in the destruction of the
status quo of the minor children, and further uphold this decision when
no finding of facts has taken place?

EMPLOYMENT HISTORY AND FAMILY DYNAMICS 
1. Throughout their marriage, both parents have alternated roles as stay-at-
home parents, adapting their employment status to meet the 
developmental needs and schedules of their children, now aged seven and 
five. This arrangement has enabled both the Petitioner and Respondent to 
maintain an active and consistent presence in their children’s lives, 
encompassing not only day-to-day care but also engagement in school 
activities and extracurricular events. This hands-on approach has been a 
testament to their dedication to the well-being and upbringing of their 
children, demonstrating a flexible yet committed stance towards 
balancing family responsibilities with personal and professional 
development opportunities as they arise. 
2. The Couple had lived paycheck to paycheck for most of the marriage, and
things began to look up when the Petitioner acquired a job as a Leasing 
Agent/Consultant near our home. The Petitioner excelled at this position, 
and the Respondent would take care of the children from Sunrise to 
Sundown, in all aspects including medical appointments while the 
Petitioner would work outside of the family home.

certification for internet sales to create personalized videos for internet

12. By January 2021, inspired by his burgeoning passion for financial
markets—and motivated by a desire to reclaim precious time with the 
Children—the Respondent made a conscientious decision to part ways 
with the dealership. This step was taken in good faith, driven by his 
commitment to both his family and his growing interest in financial 
markets, setting the stage for a new chapter in his professional and 
personal life since his employment began on July 1st, 2019. 
13. Shortly after starting this new chapter, the Respondent quickly realized
trading was going to be a lot more challenging than he had first realized, 
which lead to the evolution of his YouTube channel, renamed from 
Charlie and the Mazdas to Charlie’s Vids, where he turned his focus to 
SEC law, covering agency filings out of the Options Clearing Corporation, 
National Securities Clearing Corporation, Depository Trust Company, 
Depository Trust Clearing Corporation, FINRA, the Code of Federal 
Regulations, the Office of Financial Research, amongst other market 
agencies. 
14. The Respondent would cover the filings, accompanied by PowerPoint
presentations for the viewer, which quickly became well-received, 
garnering the Respondent over 30,000 subscribers by May of 2021.

personal life since his employment began on July 1*, 2019.

13. Shortly after starting this new chapter, the Respondent quickly realized
trading was going to be a lot more challenging than he had first realized,
which lead to the evolution of his YouTube channel, renamed from
Charlie and the Mazdas to Charlie’s Vids, where he turned his focus to
SEC law, covering agency filings out of the Options Clearing Corporation,
National Securities Clearing Corporation, Depository Trust Company,
Depository Trust Clearing Corporation, FINRA, the Code of Federal
Regulations, the Office of Financial Research, amongst other market

agencies.

14. The Respondent would cover the filings, accompanied by PowerPoint
presentations for the viewer, which quickly became well-received,

garnering the Respondent over 30,000 subscribers by May of 2021.

waiting period for divorce, citing that an active order of 
protection was currently in place, and that family violence 
had been found to have occurred during the Couple’s 
marriage. Neither of these statements were true, as the

Couple’s landlords into believing that she needed 
protection, which was followed by the initiation of an 
Eviction suit on Sunday, 12-17-2023 in which the

RESPONDENT’S PARENTAL INDEX 
The Respondent has had one objective throughout this case: 
__________________________________________________ 
To prioritize the children’s well-being and uphold the existing familial structure, 
while actively promoting a healthy and ongoing relationship between the children 
and both parents. This commitment is rooted in the understanding that the 
continued involvement of both parents in the children’s daily lives is not only 
beneficial but essential for their emotional and psychological development. The 
Respondent seeks to ensure that the children’s interests are placed at the forefront of 
all decisions, advocating for a stable and nurturing environment that supports their 
growth and well-being, which is not the current environment.

While the Petitioner spent the majority of her time between the dates of 
2023-12-01 and 2024-01-16 filing frivolous suits rather than considering 
the children’s best interests, the Respondent prioritized their holiday and 
school break while simultaneously combating concurrent lawsuits brought 
against him by the Petitioner and her family.

THE RESPONDENT’S EFFORTS 
1. Due to having failed legal representation, the resources required to
acquire alternative Counsel after the termination of Mr. Bacalis coupled
with the growing dis-trust of the Judicial System as a whole given the
totality of circumstances left the Respondent with having to represent
himself, which is a task he has taken seriously in an effort to advocate for
his daughters in a zealous manner.
2. The Respondent has researched and is aware of the ever-growing burden
pro-se litigants are becoming on the Courts, their staff, and their
resources due to the vast majority of pro-se litigants not putting in the
time or effort reasonably required to represent themselves effectively or
are solely trying to reduce costs associated with their case, both leading to
increased case lengths and litigation costs.

ARGUMENT 
I. Best Interests of the Children
1. In the case concerning the unjust removal of a father from his
residence on January 16, 2024, without prior notice, which abruptly 
ended his meaningful relationship with his daughters and significantly 
impacted his livelihood due to his home-based business operations, the 
Court notably failed to comply with the essential legal principles set forth 
in Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367 (Tex. 1976). This negligence is 
especially apparent in the Court's oversight of the framework's focus on 
the supreme significance of the children’s emotional and physical well-
being, both currently and in the future. 
2. The decision in Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367 (Tex. 1976),
emphasizes the importance of conducting a comprehensive analysis that 
considers an extensive range of considerations—including the children's 
emotional and physical needs, potential risks to their safety, and the 
caregiving capabilities of the parties seeking custody—to determine the 
child's best interest. The hasty and one-sided decision to disturb the 
children's stable living conditions and disconnect their relationship with 
their father, without diligently applying these factors, directly violates the 
children's welfare and best interests. 
4. It is essential to highlight that the Court’s neglect in evaluating the
profound implications on the children’s emotional well-being, by placing 
them in a setting where their relational ties with their father are not only 
unencouraged but actively hindered, flagrantly contravenes established

5. Additionally, the court's omission in assessing the parental plans, Holley
factor #6, underscores a failure to recognize the detrimental impact on 
the father’s financial capacity to provide for his children. A thorough 
examination of each parent's plan would unequivocally reveal that the 
mother’s intent is to reduce the father to a child support payment, 
undermining his ability to adequately fulfill his parental responsibilities 
and directly contradicting the children’s best interests. 
6. Moreover, the oversight of the fourth Holley factor, concerning the
father’s parenting abilities, especially his demonstrated proficiency in 
harmonizing his professional and familial obligations in a manner that 
advantages the financial and emotional well-being of his daughters, is

encroach upon the private domain of family life without compelling 
justification. 
8. In Troxel, the Court stressed that:
“[t]he liberty interest at issue in this case—the interest of parents in the care, 
custody, and control of their children—is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental 
liberty interests recognized by this Court.” -Troxel, 530 U.S. at 65. 
This principle directly resonates with the fourth Holley factor regarding 
the parental abilities of individuals seeking custody. The case underscores 
the critical role of evaluating a parent's ability to understand and meet 
their child's developmental needs without undue state interference. 
9. Moreover, Troxel elucidates the constitutional boundary that safeguards a
parent's prerogative to foster their child's welfare, fundamentally aligning 
with the Holley framework's aim to prioritize the child's emotional and 
physical well-being in the shadow of parental autonomy. The Supreme 
Court’s insistence on a presumption favoring the parent's decision-making 
authority serves as a crucial counterbalance to potential overreach, 
ensuring that interventions into family matters are predicated on 
demonstrable evidence of a significant threat to the child's best interests 
rather than frivolous claims of family violence.

and baseless accusations—presents a compelling argument for immediate 
judicial relief. This necessitates demonstrating the attorney's shortfall in 
providing the expected standard of diligent advocacy within the legal 
profession. Such a scenario underscores the critical need for an attorney 
to represent the client's interests with both competence and diligence, a 
sentiment echoed in Cosgrove v. Grimes, 774 S.W.2d 662, 665 (Tex. 
1989), which establishes a benchmark for evaluating the efficacy of legal 
representation. 
11. In Cosgrove v. Grimes, the court articulated the imperative for attorneys to

the Court opined: 
"[There is] no subjective good faith excuse for attorney negligence. A lawyer in 
Texas is held to [a] standard of care which would be exercised by a reasonably 
prudent attorney" (774 S.W.2d at 665). 
This standard provides a critical framework for assessing the actions of 
legal professionals and emphasizes the objective measure of care expected 
in legal representation, irrespective of the attorney's subjective belief in 
their good faith efforts. 
12. Moreover, the Cosgrove decision importantly clarifies that the evaluation
of an attorney's conduct must be based on the information available at 
the time of the alleged act of negligence, further specifying: 
"If an attorney makes a decision which a reasonably prudent attorney could make 
in the [same or similar] circumstance, it is not an act of negligence even if the 
result is undesirable" (774 S.W.2d at 665)." (774 S.W.2d at 665).

14. Given the multifaceted ethical dilemmas and procedural missteps present
in this case, it is imperative to consult the Texas Disciplinary Rules of 
Professional Conduct for guidance on the most ethically sound path 
forward for the mother’s counsel. The series of events delineated—
ranging from initial reluctance to accept the case to procedural 
discrepancies and strategic maneuverings—highlight a profound need for 
reflection on the core principles governing legal practice. 
15. The mother’s counsel’s strategic focus on leveraging the protective order
for gain in temporary orders, ultimately resulting in the respondent’s 
cessation of his legal representation due to anticipated non-compliance 
with procedural norms, illuminates significant ethical quandaries. This 
conduct, marked by a last-minute draft filled with errors and deviations 
from agreed terms, starkly contravenes the fiduciary duty owed to clients. 
Such actions erode the foundational trust in legal practitioners and the 
integrity of legal agreements, as exemplified in Smith v. Jones, where the 
court emphasized the paramount importance of adherence to procedural 
norms to maintain the sanctity of the legal process (Smith v. Jones, 123 
S.W.3d 456, 460 (Tex. 2003)).

16. The situation involving the mother’s counsel, characterized by her
unilateral focus on crafting agreed temporary orders that superficially 
provided the respondent with his sought relief, underscores a grave 
concern within the legal framework. This strategic maneuvering led to the

recognizing the inevitability of procedural non-compliance inherent in the

failed to meet the outlined procedural requirements. This failure was

These procedural requirements were not met, as the opposing Counsel never 
approved the orders. Furthermore, no motion to sign was set within the 
specified timeframe. 
24. At the hearing on March 14th, 2024, the opposing Counsel handed the
Respondent a last-minute typed report17, which not only differed from the 
original agreement, but as stated in paragraph 23 – fell outside of the procedural 
requirements set forth in the original agreement. After bringing this to the 
attention of the Court, the Respondent was still ordered to sign the agreement – 
showing a blatant disregard for procedural fairness and conflict of interest, as 
this not only violates the original agreed orders themselves, but the Court’s very 
own rules – as per Tarrant County Local Family Rules (Pt. 4, P.12). 
VI. Inappropriate Issuance of Temporary Restraining Order
25. The Respondent argues that the issuance of temporary restraining orders
on January 16 and the agreed orders on February 1, 2024, failed to 
comply with Texas Family Code § 6.501(b)(2)(A)(C). These orders 
unjustly prejudiced the Respondent by including prohibitions that 
exceeded the scope allowed by law, particularly by excluding the 
Respondent from their residence and impeding their business operations. 
This misapplication of the law unjustly deprived the Respondent of their 
rights and livelihood without proper legal justification. 
VII. Misapplication of Temporary Ex Parte Order Requirements
26. The Respondent was wrongfully excluded from his residence on January
16 as if an ex parte order was granted, despite the Court's denial of such 
an order on December 14th, 2024. The subsequent actions taken 
effectively mirrored the impact of an ex parte order without adhering to

These procedural requirements were not met, as the opposing Counsel never

approved the orders. Furthermore, no motion to sign was set within the

specified timeframe.

24. At the hearing on March 14", 2024, the opposing Counsel handed the
Respondent a last-minute typed report!’, which not only differed from the
original agreement, but as stated in paragraph 23 - fell outside of the procedural
requirements set forth in the original agreement. After bringing this to the
attention of the Court, the Respondent was still ordered to sign the agreement —
showing a blatant disregard for procedural fairness and conflict of interest, as
this not only violates the original agreed orders themselves, but the Court’s very

own rules — as per Tarrant County Local Family Rules (Pt. 4, P.12).
VI. Inappropriate Issuance of Temporary Restraining Order

25.The Respondent argues that the issuance of temporary restraining orders

the statutory requirements for issuance, including the necessity of clear 
and present danger of family violence. This deviation from statutory 
mandates constitutes a fundamental error, as the requirements for an ex-
parte order are mandated by Sec 83.001 of the Texas Family Code. 
VIII. Non-compliance with Temporary Order Requirements
27. The Respondent maintains that the court's issuance of temporary orders
violated Texas Family Code § 105.001(b). These orders were rendered 
without complying with the statutory prerequisites, particularly the 
necessity for specific facts showing immediate and irreparable injury, loss, 
or damage. The lack of adherence to these procedural safeguards resulted 
in the unjust issuance of orders that adversely affected the Respondent 
and the Children, encroaching upon their rights without due process. 
IX. Frivolous Pleadings
28. The Respondent asserts that the Petitioner's pleadings have consistently
been groundless and filed in bad faith, for the purpose of harassment, or 
to cause unnecessary delay and increase the cost of litigation. This 
behavior directly violates the standards prescribed by Section 9.011 of the 
Texas Practice and Remedies Code. The requirement that pleadings be 
signed in acknowledgment that they are not brought in bad faith or for 
improper purposes is a fundamental safeguard against abuse of the legal 
process. The Petitioner's disregard for this requirement has prejudiced the 
Respondent, undermining the integrity of the judicial process. 
29. Given the clear violations of Section 9.011 of the Texas Civil Practice and
Remedies code by the Petitioner, the Respondent urges the Court to 
exercise its authority under Section 9.012. The Court is empowered to 
impose appropriate sanctions after a determination that a pleading has

CONCLUSION 
31. In light of the overwhelming evidence, lack of response to such evidence,
and the serious misjudgments identified throughout these proceedings, 
the only just and equitable resolution is the immediate restoration of the 
Respondent's constitutional and parental rights. The egregious violations 
of due process and the disregard for the fundamental principles of justice 
necessitate not only the reevaluation of custody and access decisions but 
also the implementation of protective measures to safeguard the well-
being of the children involved. 
32. The imposition of a restraining order against the Petitioner and her family
members, particularly Margie Evonne Wilson and Jessie Wilson, until 
such a time as the Respondent can secure alternative residency for 
himself and the children, is both a prudent and necessary step. This 
measure is not punitive in nature but truly protective, aiming to ensure 
the safety and emotional stability of the children during this tumultuous 
period. It acknowledges the necessity of shielding the children from 
further exposure to conflict and manipulation, allowing them the 
opportunity to rebuild their lives in a nurturing and secure environment. 
33. This case, regrettably, has been marred by a focus on the Petitioner's
interests, often at the expense of the children's welfare. It is imperative 
that this Court pivots towards a child-centric approach, emphasizing 
decisions that genuinely reflect the best interests of the children, rather

However, since December 2023, there has been a notable decline in the
reliability and efficiency of the service provided. This shift coincides with Mr.
Myers facing significant personal and legal challenges, including a divorce
proceeding that has drastically impacted his ability to operate his business
effectively. A particularly distressing development for Mr. Myers has been his
inability to access the physical location where his business equipment and
data connections are housed. This situation has not only disrupted the service
but has also imposed significant financial difficulties on Mr. Myers, threatening
the sustainability of the business and the quality of service that customers

have come to expect.

The repercussions of these challenges have been felt deeply by both Mr.
Myers and his clientele. While the community understands and sympathizes
with Mr. Myers’ personal struggles, the increasing service disruptions have
raised concerns among users about the future reliability and viability of the
service. We are hopeful for a resolution that will allow Mr. Myers to regain
access to his business infrastructure, thereby restoring the service quality and
reliability that we have valued highly. It is in the interest of both Mr. Myers and
his customers to find a solution that addresses these operational challenges
while supporting him through his personal difficulties, ensuring the long-term
success and sustainability of the service.

I subscribed for an extensive education program under Charles Myers to gain expertise in

reading and researching market data. Charles Myers, a dedicated father, teacher, and
mentor, has been instrumental in inspiring myself and numerous others to independently

pursue knowledge in the field of financial data. The instability in Charles Myers' living
situation has adversely affected his ability to fulfill his work commitments to the best of

his capacity. This instability has had a significant impact on my ability to efficiently learn

and absorb the subject matter, as Charles Myers is unable to work full time from his

home office. Charles Myers requires a meticulously crafted computer setup to efficiently

manage and process extensive data sets and resource-intensive programs essential for his

work in market research and education. The consequence of Charles Myers' restricted

| am a paying customer of Charles Myers for the past two years and four months. In this time, he has been
working exclusively out of his home office to run his business, and provide for his family.

Charles has worked very hard for the past two years to provide a quality experience that benefits
all of his customers. His ability to provide these services have been directly impacted by his inability to

access his home office. As a result, my experience as a customer has suffered, and | am not receiving

the level of service that | have been paying for. | understand that there are unfortunate circumstances

and | am patient while Charles resolves his situation. He has been incredibly apologetic that he cannot

provide the same level of quality, and uninterrupted service due to his inability to work out of his home

office. | do not question his integrity with regards to this situation, he has always been honest and upfront

with myself and others. My hope is that he may return to his home office in order to avoid shutting down

I'm signing this affidavit to attest to the work ethic and
dedication of Charles Myers. I've come to rely on the
services he provides in order to gather the required data to
make educated decisions on what and when to enter/exit
options positions. Recently due to him not being at his
normal location of operations the services have had multiple
down times in which Charles was not in a position to be able
to remedy. Some of these down times have led to significant
losses due to making decisions without the necessary data
after already being entered in a position.

STATEMENT OF THE CASE 
Nature of the Case:  The underlying suit is a divorce 
Respondents: 
Respondents’ actions: 
proceeding initiated by Mother 
overseen by two separate Judges 
which waived the 60-day waiting 
period due to an alleged active 
order of protection against the 
Father and was consolidated with a 
protective order claiming 
harassment and sexual harassment 
from the Relator. 
Respondents are Hon. James 
Munford, presiding District Judge 
& Hon. Jeffrey N. Kaitcer, 
presiding Associate Judge of the 
322nd District Court of Tarrant 
County, Texas.  
Both respondents contributed to 
the removal of an active and 
involved father from his 
children's lives, lacking judicial 
oversight and disregarding the 
facts, thereby destabilizing the 
children's lives, and overlooking 
the father's significant role. 
This approach not only enabled the 
mother's frivolous litigation but 
also cast a long shadow on the 
children's future by prioritizing 
unsubstantiated claims over the 
well-being and stability of the 
family.

Issues Presented 
Issue No. 1: The District Judge prematurely removed the 
Father from his home and children's lives without a 
formal hearing, and the Associate Judge extended this 
separation by granting a continuance due to the Mother's 
last-minute acquisition of counsel, exacerbating the 
Father’s unjust removal, and disregarding due process 
and the children’s best interests. 
Issue No. 2: AJ Respondent abused his discretion when 
rendering temporary orders affecting the parent-child 
relationship without notice and hearing, granting the 
Mother more time to acquire Counsel while prolonging 
the Realtor’s unjustified removal from his home and 
business, and leaving the Children without an involved 
parent who provides for them out of the home.
Issue No. 3: The current temporary orders have no 
basis in fact or law and are merely an extension of 
the initial temporary orders.

SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT

The actions taken by DJ Respondent and AJ
Respondent represent a clear abuse of discretion,
violating the explicit statutory mandates of the Texas
Family Code concerning the issuance of orders affecting
conservatorship and support, without due notice anda

formal hearing.

DJ Respondent overstepped by appointing the Mother

as primary managing conservator of the children during

a protective order hearing, sidestepping the critical 
procedural requirement for evidence presentation and 
witness testimony. This contravenes TEX. FAM. CODE §
105.001(b), which mandates that orders under 
subsections (a)(1), (2), or (5) — directly relevant to 
conservatorship — cannot be rendered absent notice and 
a  hearing. By preemptively assigning conservatorship 
to the Mother under TEX. FAM. CODE § 105.001(a)(1), DJ 
Respondent disregarded these statutory obligations, 
underscoring an unequivocal abuse of discretion. 
Similarly, AJ Respondent compounded this disregard 
for statutory requirements on January 22nd, 2024. With 
the expiration of DJ Respondent’s orders, AJ Respondent 
enacted temporary orders affecting the conservatorship 
of the children and Father’s access to his residence, 
all without the benefit of a hearing, attributed to the 
Mother's last-minute retention of counsel. This action 
flouts the same legal requirement for notice and a 
hearing as outlined in TEX. FAM. CODE § 105.001(b), 
highlighting a systemic breach of due process.

attorney, concerning “the temporary conservatorship of 
the children” and “temporary support of the children”

stipulation that such orders must not be rendered 
without a prior hearing, as per TEX. FAM. CODE §

forced the Father into agreeing to conditions without 
the foundational due process, further compelling his 
termination of legal counsel and challenging the orders

The DJ Respondent rendered temporary orders affecting

removed from his home, business, and Children’s daily

The TEX. FAM. CODE specifically safeguards the initial

One possible argument for lack of notice may be

This abuse is manifest in two critical aspects: 
firstly, through a failure to exercise the discretionary 
powers vested by law in a manner required by the 
circumstances; and secondly, by making determinations 
that contravene established legal rules, principles, or 
criteria. Specifically, In re Marriage of Runberg, 159
S.W.3d 194 (Tex. App. 2005) elucidates that "a trial 
court abuses its discretion if it declines to exercise a 
power of discretion vested in it by law when the 
circumstances require that the power be exercised; or if 
it arrives at its choice in violation of an applicable 
legal rule, principle, or criterion." Id.

errors committed in the present case, leaving the 
Relator seeking relief from the onset, which was

1.Rather than a hearing on February 1st, 2024, Counsel
usurped the proceedings and began negotiations,
giving no other alternative to the Relator than to
Sign the agreed report, terminate his Counsel, and

challenge the orders through reconsideration.

On February 1, 2024, the court's proceedings took a
turn that did not prioritize a hearing but rather led
to negotiations culminating in an Agreed Associate
Judge’s Report. This report granted the Relator
temporary access to his home and business until March
1, 2024, while paradoxically removing the Children
until the same date and reaffirming the Mother's

status as the primary conservator.App. 75-80.

With no better alternative at the time, the Relator
Signed the orders, swiftly terminated his CounselApp.
99-101, and filed for reconsiderationApp. 91-98, which
was ultimately denied on March 14, 2024, after
waiting over 30 days to be heard due to Mother’s

Counsel’s availability.App. 122.

Despite this lapse of time – the opposing party did 
not object to, deny, or oppose any relief being sought 
by the Relator, calling into question the reasoning 
for denying Father’s motion when no new information 
was brought forth by the Mother and the record still 
being void of any valid reason to have removed the 
Relator from his home and business and sever his 
relationship with his Children in the first place. 
Sharing in Issue No 1, AJ Respondent also failed to 
furnish a court reporter for the reconsideration 
hearing that took place on March 14th, 2024, which 
involved the parent-child relationship, and erred in 
his affirmative duty “...to insure that the court 
reporter makes a record of proceedings involving 
parent-child relationships, unless waived by the 
parties with the court's consent, and failure to do so 
constitutes error on the face of the record requiring 
reversal." In Interest of A.O., No. 2-06-420-CV (Tex.
App. 8/31/2007) Relator’s motion for reconsideration 
was denied on March 14th, 2024.App. 122.

2. A scintilla of the factors known by the Courts for
nearly half a century were applied in this case.
Long ago, Holly v. Adams 544 S.W.2d 367 (1976) set 
forth a non-exhaustive list of factors for the Court 
to use as guidance when the Children’s best interests 
are at issue.  
Integrating the Holley v. Adams factors into the 
narrative of the case would have revealed a profound 
oversight by the court in recognizing the essential 
elements critical to the Children’s best interests, 
and the actions by the Mother would have been seen in 
the light that truly reflects what they are: 
frivolous, deceptive, and vindictive – calling into 
question her parental abilities and “acts indicating 
that the parent-child relationship is not a proper

announcement on December 1st, 2023.App. 112-115. Had 
the Court looked into the Mother’s plan, it would have 
been revealed that she had no plan outside of 
influencing her grandparents to unlawfully attempt to 
evict the Relator just prior to ChristmasApp 1-2 and 
by filing for protection multiple times to sever the 
relationship between the Relator and his daughters.

CONCLUSON 
Granting this writ of mandamus is not only 
profoundly  beneficial for the Children by reinstating 
their father into the family home and his essential 
business operations but also places a negligible 
burden on the Mother. This action’s necessity is 
compellingly highlighted in In re Team Rocket, L.P.,

underscores the critical importance of immediate 
judicial intervention in this case, where the balance 
decidedly favors the restoration of the Father’s 
roles, both as a parent and a provider, which were 
abruptly severed at the beginning of this case. 
The Mother’s decision to live elsewhere, driven by 
personal choices rather than any substantiated need 
for protection, should not preclude the Children from 
maintaining a stable and nurturing environment with 
their Father. Multiple available alternative 
residencies nearby to the mother afford a practical 
solution for both parents to continue playing active 
roles in their Children’s lives amidst the legal 
proceedings. 
The Relator urges this Honorable Court to vacate the 
temporary orders in place and restore the fundamental 
rights swiftly taken from him, as this situation is a 
prima face case of abuse by the trial court 
inadvertently allowing the Mother’s weaponization of 
protective orders.

The decision to disconnect the father from his 
children starkly illustrates judicial oversight, 
further exacerbated by the Father's need to represent 
himself pro se due to inadequate legal representation 
previously. 
By excluding the Father from his operational base, 
the court not only removed a daily caregiver but also 
destabilized the primary financial support system for 
the Mother and the Children. 
This decision seemingly overlooks the comprehensive 
framework intended to guide judicial discretion in such 
matters, a framework well-established in the seminal 
case of Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367 (1976). The 
Holley decision articulates a non-exhaustive set of 
factors specifically designed to assist courts in 
ascertaining the best interest of the child, 
encompassing considerations such as the emotional and 
physical needs of the child, the parental abilities of 
the individual’s seeking custody, and the stability of 
the home environment, among others.

and Nullifying the Enforceability of the Orders
Issued

According to the Texas Family Code, if the 60-day

waiting period is waived due to an active order of

protection, “[t]he petitioner shall attach to the 
petition a copy of each order...regarding the conduct 
alleged in the application or order without regard to 
the date of the order. If a copy of the order is not 
available at the time of filing, the petition must state 
that a copy of the order will be filed with the court 
before any hearing.” Id § 6.405(b). The fact that the 
Mother elected to waive the 60-day waiting period, and 
due to the fact no such order of protection ever 
existed against the Father, no hearing should have ever 
taken place in this case as a copy of the non-existent 
order was never filed with the court, which is a 
requirement before any hearing. 
2. The orders rendered on March 26th fell outside of

2.The orders rendered on March 26% fell outside of

which specifically stated:

Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be 
prepared by Dan Bacalis. Each attorney should 
approve the Order. The parties do not need to 
approve the Order. The attorney reviewing the 
proposed Order shall have five (5) days to do so. 
There are no ten (10) day letters. If an agreement 
is not reached, a Motion to Sign shall be filed and

this Report.”App. 79. 
The procedural integrity of court orders is 
paramount to ensure that the administration of 
justice is carried out with the highest degree of 
legitimacy and fairness. On March 26th, these 
Temporary Orders were rendered which fundamentally 
breached the explicit procedural mandates set forth 
within them. The underpinning of this procedural 
breach 
rests 
on 
two 
critical 
junctures:

Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be
prepared by Dan Bacalis. Each attorney should
approve the Order. The parties do not need to
approve the Order. The attorney reviewing the
proposed Order shall have five (5) days to do so.
There are no ten (10) day letters. If an agreement
is not reached, a Motion to Sign shall be filed and
set within thirty (30) days from the signing of
this Report.”App. 79.

The procedural integrity of court orders is
paramount to ensure that the administration of
justice is carried out with the highest degree of

legitimacy and fairness. On March 26th, these

Temporary Orders were rendered which fundamentally
breached the explicit procedural mandates set forth
within them. The underpinning of this procedural
breach rests on two critical junctures: the
preparation of the order and the time frames for
review and filing subsequent to disagreement.

3.Dan Bacalis was terminated and did not reduce the

orders to writing.

Firstly, the necessity for a typed written Order

to be prepared by Dan Bacalis is unambiguously

Stated. This task, assigned to Mr. Bacalis, is not

merely a formality, but a substantial procedural 
requirement, implying his unique role and input in 
the process. The preparation of the order by any 
individual other than Dan Bacalis, therefore, 
violates the stipulated procedural requirement, 
rendering the resultant orders intrinsically flawed 
and devoid of legitimacy. 
Further compromising the orders' validity is the 
departure of Dan Bacalis from his position prior to 
this critical task being completed. Since the 
procedural directive was unequivocally tied to his 
participation, his premature termination disrupted 
the process and invalidated the subsequent steps 
taken in his absence. As such, there was a failure 
in compliance with the foundational requirements, 
and any order produced thereafter lacks the requisite 
procedural lineage to be enforceable. 
4. The reviewing counsel did not comply with the time
constraints in any aspect.

Secondly, the timeframes established by the 
procedural requirements are strict and serve as an 
essential 
mechanism 
to 
maintain 
order 
and 
predictability in legal proceedings. The attorney 
reviewing the proposed order was accorded a five-day 
window to do so. This period is designed to 
facilitate 
swift 
and 
efficient 
agreement 
or 
identification of disagreements. In this case, the 
reviewing attorney, Cooper Carter, failed to reach 
an agreement within the prescribed timeframe. 
The protocol following such a failure is equally 
clear: “should no agreement be reached, a Motion to 
Sign must be filed and set within thirty days from 
the signing of the report.” Id. 
This step is not an optional or discretionary 
act but a mandatory one to progress the matter in 
the absence of consensus. The inaction to file and 
set the motion within this allotted time further 
erodes the procedural validity of the orders.

Moreover, the preparation of the typed written 
order by Cooper Carter, substituting for Dan Bacalis, 
43 days after the signing of the report, transgresses 
the specified procedural timeframe. This delay not 
only disregards the explicit 20-day guideline but 
also surpasses the 30-day window for setting a Motion 
to Sign in the event of a lack of agreement. This 
protraction and procedural noncompliance serve to 
nullify the legal force of the orders. 
Given these clear procedural deviations, the orders 
rendered on March 26th are procedurally deficient. 
They do not embody the integrity and binding force 
expected of court mandates. Consequently, these 
orders must be regarded as void ab initio — without 
legal effect from the outset — as they were not 
produced in accordance with the mandated procedures 
that are fundamental for their validity. The court

including the granting of a temporary injunction for the preservation of the property and
protection of the parties as deemed necessary and equitable and including an order directed
to one or both parties:
(1) requiring a sworn inventory and appraisement of the real and personal property owned
or claimed by the parties and specifying the form, manner, and substance of the inventory
and appraisal and list of debts and liabilities;

Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001
Section 105.001 - Temporary Orders Before Final Order
(a) In a suit, the court may make a temporary order, including the modification of a prior
temporary order, for the safety and welfare of the child, including an order:
(1) for the temporary conservatorship of the child;
(2) for the temporary support of the child;
(3) restraining a party from disturbing the peace of the child or another party;
(4) prohibiting a person from removing the child beyond a geographical area identified by
the court; or

regarding the rendition of a temporary order described by Subsection (a) has not yet
occurred, the court may not postpone the hearing to a date that is later than the 30th day
after the date set for the hearing.
(b) Except as provided by Subsection (c), temporary restraining orders and temporary
injunctions under this section shall be granted without the necessity of an affidavit or
verified pleading stating specific facts showing that immediate and irreparable injury, loss,
or damage will result before notice can be served and a hearing can be held. Except as
provided by Subsection (h), an order may not be rendered under Subsection (a)(1), (2), or
(5) except after notice and a hearing. A temporary restraining order or temporary injunction
granted under this section need not:
(1) define the injury or state why it is irreparable;
(2) state why the order was granted without notice; or
(3) include an order setting the cause for trial on the merits with respect to the ultimate
relief requested.
(c) Except on a verified pleading or an affidavit in accordance with the Texas Rules of Civil
Procedure, an order may not be rendered:
(1) attaching the body of the child;
(2) taking the child into the possession of the court or of a person designated by the court;
or
(3) excluding a parent from possession of or access to a child.
(d) In a suit, the court may dispense with the necessity of a bond in connection with
temporary orders on behalf of the child.
(e) Temporary orders rendered under this section are not subject to interlocutory appeal.
