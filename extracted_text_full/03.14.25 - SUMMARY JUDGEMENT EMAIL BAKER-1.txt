Ms. Baker,
My Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, filed February 22, 2024, remains unopposed for over a year. Under TRCP
166a(c) and Local Rule 4.01(d), this motion is ripe for ruling. Opposing counsel’s failure to respond waives any objection.
Further, opposing counsel (CC'ed here), cannot prosecute her case in accordance with Texas law, and still has an
outstanding rule 12 motion that is now also unopposed.
A granting of either motion would resolve the core case issues, and given the circumstances, is duly warranted.
I formally request an immediate ruling or confirmation of when the Court will act. Further delay is unacceptable.
If the judges cannot legally act given opposing counsels failure to comply with Tex. R. CIV. P. 237a, then the matter should
be brought before David L. Evans without delay.
Sincerely,
Charles Dustin Myers

Hello Lindsey,
I hope you are doing well. I am following up on the Myers v. Myers matter (Cause No. 322-744263-23 in the 322nd District
Court), which was remanded back from federal court on December 17, 2024. As of today, the opposing party still has not
filed the Notice of Remand or otherwise re-engaged with the case. This has left our case in limbo on the court’s docket. In
the meantime, Charles Dustin Myers (Respondent), is suffering ongoing harm each day without the court’s intervention on
pending matters.
To recap the situation briefly:
The federal court remanded the case to state court on 12/17/2024. Under Texas Rule 237a, it was Petitioner’s
responsibility to file the remand order with the clerk and notify us. That never happened. We are now three months post-
remand, and the case has not been officially re-docketed due to this oversight.

I have multiple pending motions that were filed before and after the remand. Critically, Petitioner and her counsel have not
responded to ANY of these motions. For example, the Motion for Summary Judgment (filed 2/26/2024) received no
response. More urgently, our Ex Parte Motion for Child Custody, Exclusive Use of Marital Residence, Contempt, and
Sanctions (filed 2/12/2025) remains unopposed and unaddressed. We also filed a Proposed Order on 2/20/2025 and a
Request for Immediate Ruling on 2/28/2025, with no response from the other side.
The issues in that ex parte motion are time-sensitive and critical: we need a court order for custody and to regain access
to the marital home. Opposing counsel’s failure to follow procedure has effectively stalled relief that desperately needs
attention. (Respondent has been without access to his home and children for an extended period through no fault of his
own). There are also allegations of contempt by the opposing party that have not been heard because of these delays.
Given this extraordinary situation, we respectfully ask the Court to take immediate action. Specifically, we request one of
the following at the Court’s earliest convenience (and we truly mean as soon as possible, even this week if feasible):
Immediate ruling/signing of orders: Since the motions are unopposed, the Court can rule on them without a hearing. I
have a proposed Order for the ex parte motion ready for Judge Kaitcer’s signature. I urge the Court to sign an order
granting Respondent temporary custody of the children and exclusive use of the residence immediately. This would
provide much-needed stability while the case proceeds. Similarly, the motion for summary judgment can be granted on
the papers, as no controverting evidence or response was ever filed by Petitioner.
Emergency hearing: If the Court prefers to hold a hearing, please provide the soonest possible date and time for an
emergency hearing on the Ex Parte Motion (2/12/2025), and a notice will be filed tomorrow. I am prepared to appear on
short notice. Given that the motion is unopposed, the hearing should be brief. Respondent will gladly testify to confirm the
facts if needed. He just needs the Court’s authorization to move forward – every day of delay is another day he is barred
from his home and children.
Filing of Remand Order: To remove any procedural barrier, Respondent will obtain a certified copy of the federal remand
order and he will file it himself (or hand-deliver a copy) to the Court. If the clerk needs that filed separately to officially
reopen the case, please let me know – it will be done immediately. I do not want a clerical formality to stand between the
children and justice any longer.
Sanctions for non-compliance (if appropriate): Resppndent also wants the Court to be aware that opposing counsel’s
conduct – failing to file the remand notice and ignoring court filings – is sanctionable. While the priority is getting relief for
the children,  the intent is to address this issue at the appropriate time. For now, this failure should at least not be
rewarded by further delaying proceedings. Respondent shouldn’t have to wait indefinitely due to the other side’s
procedural neglect.
In sum, Respondent is asking for the Court’s help to break the logjam created by the opposing party. Our requests are
straightforward and unopposed. The court has the authority to grant the relief either ex parte or by default given the
circumstances. Respondent is simply requesting that the Court exercise that authority as soon as possible to prevent
further irreparable harm.
My tone in this email is urgent because the situation is urgent. I have been exceedingly patient while trying every avenue
to move this case forward. With each passing day, the situation worsens and the children at issue remain in uncertainty. I
trust that the 322nd District Court strives to resolve such matters fairly and expeditiously, and I am eager to assist in any
way to facilitate a prompt resolution.
Proposed next steps:
If Judge Kaitcer (or the assigned judge) is available to review the file tomorrow, we urge him to sign the proposed Order
(filed 2/20/2025) granting the relief in the 2/12/2025 motion. I am available by phone or email if the Court has any
questions or slight modifications to the order.
Alternatively, please provide a setting for an emergency hearing as early as possible. Even a telephone or Zoom hearing
would be acceptable, given the urgency, if that would expedite the process. A notice of hearing will be filed Monday.
If there are any concerns about the procedural posture (such as the missing Notice of Remand), please let me know. I am
prepared to cure any such issue immediately. I can file the remand order and serve opposing counsel (to the extent she
will accept service) to remove any doubt that the case is properly before the Court.
Thank you very much for your time and attention to this matter, Lindsey. I understand the Court has a busy docket, but
this case has unusual circumstances that warrant special handling. I greatly appreciate any assistance you can provide in
conveying the urgency of this situation to Judge Kaitcer, Judge Munford, or in the alternative, Judge Evans. I am hopeful
that, with the Court’s intervention, we can obtain a ruling or hearing in a matter of days, bringing much-needed relief and
allowing the case to progress.

Dear Ms. Baker,
Thanks for your response.
As I previously pointed out, the Order of Assignment from Judge David L. Evans assigned Justice Lee Gabriel to the case.
That assignment remains in effect until Judge Evans issues a written termination order, as stated. To my knowledge, no
such order has been issued or served.
Until that occurs, it would be procedurally improper to request a court hearing, particularly given that the opposing party
has yet to fulfill their obligation under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 237a by filing a Notice of Remand after removal to
federal court.
It would be helpful if these issues could be resolved as soon as possible so that the case can proceed effectively.
Best regards,
Charles Dustin Myers
