TO THE HONORABLE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS: 
Relator, Charles Dustin Myers, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court 
consolidate three pending mandamus petitions. These petitions challenge: an order 
by the Honorable Kenneth Newell of the 233rd District Court consolidating cases 
(arising from Cause No. 233-765358-25, on mandamus review from Cause No. 02-
25-00171-CV); the refusal by the Honorable Kate Stone, Associate Judge of the
233rd District Court, to hear an emergency Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) 
(arising from Cause No. 233-765358-25, on mandamus review from Cause No. 02-
25-00164-CV); and orders by the Honorable Jeff Kaitcer, Associate Judge of the
322nd District Court (arising from Cause No. 322-744263-23, on mandamus review 
from Cause No. 02-25-00166-CV).  
Consolidation of these petitions is appropriate and necessary for judicial 
economy, a comprehensive review of the interconnected issues, and to address the 
systemic denial of Relator’s fundamental parental rights and due process across these 
related proceedings. The petitions, while arising from distinct orders and involving 
different respondent judges, are inextricably linked by common parties, overlapping 
factual circumstances, a consistent pattern of alleged judicial overreach and 
procedural irregularities, and the profound impact on Relator’s relationship with his 
children. All parties have been notified of this motion related to these petitions, and 
no response was received. For the foregoing reasons, Relator urges this court to act:

TO THE HONORABLE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS:

Relator, Charles Dustin Myers, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court
consolidate three pending mandamus petitions. These petitions challenge: an order
by the Honorable Kenneth Newell of the 233rd District Court consolidating cases
(arising from Cause No. 233-765358-25, on mandamus review from Cause No. 02-
25-00171-CV); the refusal by the Honorable Kate Stone, Associate Judge of the
233rd District Court, to hear an emergency Temporary Restraining Order (TRO)
(arising from Cause No. 233-765358-25, on mandamus review from Cause No. 02-
25-00164-CV); and orders by the Honorable Jeff Kaitcer, Associate Judge of the
322nd District Court (arising from Cause No. 322-744263-23, on mandamus review
from Cause No. 02-25-00166-CV).

Consolidation of these petitions is appropriate and necessary for judicial
economy, a comprehensive review of the interconnected issues, and to address the
systemic denial of Relator’s fundamental parental rights and due process across these
related proceedings. The petitions, while arising from distinct orders and involving
different respondent judges, are inextricably linked by common parties, overlapping
factual circumstances, a consistent pattern of alleged judicial overreach and
procedural irregularities, and the profound impact on Relator’s relationship with his
children. All parties have been notified of this motion related to these petitions, and

no response was received. For the foregoing reasons, Relator urges this court to act:

Statement of Facts 
Relator, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, is referred to herein as “Father.” 
Real Party in Interest, MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS, is referred to herein at 
“Mother”. Each record citation marked with (R. X-X) is linked directly to the 
reference to promote judicial efficiency. 
A. The Precipitating Event and Background Facts
The events giving rise to these proceedings began on December 12, 2023, 
when the father discovered a series of text message exchanges between the mother 
and two individuals outside the marriage—identified in the record as Damen 
Kazlauskas and Debbie Price (R. 228–686). This discovery occurred shortly after 
the mother’s abrupt announcement of her intent to divorce and raised concerns 
regarding the children’s well-being and emotional environment. In an effort to 
address the matter constructively, the father contacted the mother’s grandfather—
who resides next door to the marital home—via text message to request a family 
meeting to discuss the situation (R. 692–695). 
The following day, however, when Father confronted Mother with the 
discovery—presenting his concerns in the form of data visualizations (R. 230–
232)—she began distancing herself, starting by redirecting the planned family 
conversation into a private meeting solely between herself and her grandparents (R. 
1691). On December 14, 2023, Mother initiated text communication with her

Statement of Facts

Relator, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, is referred to herein as “Father.”
Real Party in Interest, MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS, 1s referred to herein at
“Mother”. Each record citation marked with (R. X-X) is linked directly to the

reference to promote judicial efficiency.

A. The Precipitating Event and Background Facts

The events giving rise to these proceedings began on December 12, 2023,
when the father discovered a series of text message exchanges between the mother
and two individuals outside the marriage—identified in the record as Damen

The following day, however, when Father confronted Mother with the
discovery—presenting his concerns in the form of data visualizations (R. 230-

conversation into a private meeting solely between herself and her grandparents (R.

1691). On December 14, 2023, Mother initiated text communication with her

stepfather, Dan Branthoover, who resides in Yukon, Oklahoma (R. 249–253). Mr. 
Branthoover then contacted Father via text message, stating that he wanted to help 
both parties and requested a phone conversation (R. 1680). That conversation 
resulted in an arrangement for Mother to travel to Mr. Branthoover’s residence over 
the weekend beginning December 15, 2023, where Mr. Branthoover later 
acknowledged that he would be assisting with the divorce paperwork (R. 1686). 
During this same period, Mother also sought an ex parte emergency protective 
order against Father from the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County, as referenced 
in her divorce petition (R. 54). 
B. Travel, Influence and Conversion of Marital Assets
While en route to, or upon arrival at, Mr. Branthoover’s residence, Mother 
withdrew the entirety of the funds from the joint marital bank account, totaling 
$1,576 (R. 698; 1691–1692). The transaction was facilitated by Mr. Branthoover, 
who used his PayPal account—identified as “dmb575” (R. 1683)—as an 
intermediary to transfer the funds. This identifier corresponds to the relevant 
December 2023 bank statement (R. 1682). Both Mr. Branthoover and Mother later 
admitted that the transaction had occurred (R. 705, 1691). 
As a result, on December 16, 2023, Father was notified that the joint account 
had been overdrawn, which caused the suspension of his business’s advertising 
services due to a failed payment (R. 701–702). Father subsequently contacted Mr.

During this same period, Mother also sought an ex parte emergency protective

B. Travel, Influence and Conversion of Marital Assets

While en route to, or upon arrival at, Mr. Branthoover’s residence, Mother
withdrew the entirety of the funds from the joint marital bank account, totaling
$1,576 (R. 698; 1691-1692). The transaction was facilitated by Mr. Branthoover,

admitted that the transaction had occurred (R. 705, 1691).

As a result, on December 16, 2023, Father was notified that the joint account

services due to a failed payment (R. 701—702). Father subsequently contacted Mr.

--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
Branthoover in writing to request the return of the funds, explaining that the money 
was needed to cover essential family expenses and to purchase Christmas presents 
for the children (R. 703–704). During this exchange, Mr. Branthoover explicitly 
informed Father that Mother’s visit was for the purpose of receiving assistance 
with the preparation of divorce paperwork (R. 705). 
C. The Eviction
The situation escalated further on December 17, 2023, when Father was 
served with an eviction notice by Mother’s grandmother, Margie Wilson. The 
notice cited a protective order and a divorce petition as the basis for eviction, 
despite those documents not having been formally filed at the time (R. 710). The 
case was later heard by the Honorable Judge Swearingin Jr. and was dismissed for 
lack of subject matter jurisdiction (R. 711–712) on January 17, 2024. 
D. The Divorce Petition
On December 18, 2023, Mother formally filed for divorce (R. 47–57) and 
requested an “Uncontested Cases” form from the court (R. 77). In her petition, she 
claimed that the parties had stopped living together as spouses on or around 
December 1, 2023 (R. 50). She also asserted financial indigence, stating that she 
had only $21 in her bank account (R. 67) while being responsible for $1,610 in 
monthly expenses (R. 68). Contradicting the timeline established by the eviction 
notice served the previous day, the petition further alleged that an active protective

informed Father that Mother’s visit was for the purpose of receiving assistance

requested an “Uncontested Cases” form from the court (R. 77). In her petition, she
claimed that the parties had stopped living together as spouses on or around
December 1, 2023 (R. 50). She also asserted financial indigence, stating that she
had only $21 in her bank account (R. 67) while being responsible for $1,610 in
monthly expenses (R. 68). Contradicting the timeline established by the eviction

notice served the previous day, the petition further alleged that an active protective

order was already in place against Father, and that a finding of family violence had 
been made during the marriage—thereby waiving the statutory 60-day waiting 
period (R. 54). 
Mother further claimed that the marital property would be divided by 
agreement, yet designated both family vehicles as her separate property (R. 55). 
She requested joint managing conservatorship (R. 51) and sought standard 
visitation rights for Father (R. 52), while simultaneously alleging that she and the 
children could face abuse or serious harm if Father were provided with her contact 
information (R. 57). 
E. The Protective Order
Four days after filing for divorce, on December 22, 2023, Mother filed an 
application for a protective order (R. 78–84). In supporting documents, including 
an affidavit (R. 83) and an unsworn declaration, she alleged that family violence 
occurred on December 18, 2023—the same day she filed for divorce (R. 84). 
However, evidence indicates that on that same day, Mother was present at the 
family home with Father, exhibiting no signs of being in a state of emergency (R. 
1692). Mother continued to cohabit with Father intermittently following these 
filings, as evidenced by her presence at the family home on December 29, 2023, 
participating in a typical evening with Father and the children (R. 1711). Father

was formally served with the protective order suit on December 27, 2023 (R. 92–
93). 
Within the protective order application, Mother requested that Father be 
prohibited from approaching within 200 feet of the children’s school, that he cease 
all communication with her, and that he complete a battering intervention and 
prevention program (R. 80). She acknowledged the joint ownership of the 
matrimonial residence but nonetheless requested spousal support, child support, 
and Father’s immediate removal from the home (R. 80). Adding another layer to 
the situation, the day after the divorce was filed—on December 19, 2023—Mr. 
Branthoover contacted Father via text message, claiming to represent Mother in the 
legal proceedings (R. 1688–1689). Despite these filings and allegations, Father 
continued to cohabit with Mother leading up to the first scheduled legal 
proceeding: a show cause hearing set for January 16, 2024. During this interim 
period, Father prioritized the children and spent time with them during their 
holiday break (R. 801–804). 
F. Father Prepares His Defense
In response to the series of legal actions initiated by Mother, Father waited 
until after the children’s Christmas holiday to formally begin preparing his defense. 
He first filed an original answer to the protective order application, denying all 
allegations of family violence (R. 104–108). In his answer, Father raised the

affirmative defenses of fraud, illegality, and duress, asserting that Mother was 
attempting to misuse the legal process (R. 106). To support his position, Father 
attached two exhibits: the first was a copy of his Texas Department of Public 
Safety (TxDPS) record, demonstrating no history of violence (R. 109–111); the 
second highlighted inconsistencies within Mother’s divorce petition (R. 112–115). 
Subsequently, on January 3, 2024, Father filed a motion to consolidate the 
protective order proceedings with the divorce case (R. 117–120). He also 
submitted a background report intended to provide the court with context regarding 
the children’s familial circumstances (R. 121–123). Father later filed a motion for 
continuance to obtain legal representation (R. 124–126), accompanied by 
additional documentation related to the family situation (R. 127–130), including 
text message evidence from Mr. Branthoover intended to refute Mother’s claim of 
indigency (R. 136–139). Finally, on January 13, 2024, Father submitted an 
unsworn declaration detailing the sequence of events leading up to that point (R. 
150–154).

to vacate the family residence effective immediately—without conducting an 
evidentiary hearing, making specific findings, or considering Father’s 
submitted pleadings. This resulted in a de facto temporary termination of Father’s 
custodial rights. The case was reset for January 22, 2024, to be heard by the 
Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer (R. 157–158). 
Faced with the sudden loss of his residence and access to his children, Father 
sought legal representation immediately and retained attorney Daniel R. Bacalis on 
January 19, 2024—just three days before the rescheduled hearing (R. 793). Father 
promptly briefed Mr. Bacalis on the situation, providing insights into the family 
dynamics through a comprehensive statement of context (R. 143–149). 
H. Reset #1 – Show Cause 
On the rescheduled date of January 22, 2024, the parties appeared at the 
courthouse for the second setting. Mother initially appeared without legal counsel 
but retained attorney Cooper L. Carter in the courthouse lobby just prior to the 
hearing. This prompted a further delay, as the Honorable Judge Kaitcer granted a 
continuance sua sponte, resetting the case once more to February 1, 2024 (R. 160–
161). 
In the period between settings, both Mr. Bacalis, representing Father, and 
Mr. Carter, representing Mother, filed amended pleadings in the divorce 
proceedings (R. 163, 183).

with their respective counsel and announced they were ready to proceed (R. 
768).1 However, instead of the matter being heard by Honorable Jeffrey Kaitcer, 
father’s counsel, Mr. Bacalis, drafted an “Agreed Associate Judge’s Report” 
which was presented to father in the hallway outside the courtroom. (R. 203-208). 
This proposed agreement included terms to non-suit (dismiss) the protective order 
application, grant father residency in the family home only until March 1, 2024, 
and outline the division of financial responsibilities (R. 206-207). 
Father expressed significant reservations and initially refused to sign the 
agreed order, stating his desire to proceed to trial to address mother's allegations 
directly and hold her accountable, where he was told by his counsel, “I know the 
judge, this is the best we can get,” and felt pressured into signing the agreement as 
the only presented option, which was corroborated by father’s witness in an 
affidavit (R. 1343-1345). Feeling frustrated by this outcome, father paid 
particular attention to the procedural requirements highlighted in bold text within 
the agreement signed on February 1, 2024 (R. 208). The Father then realized that 
if he terminated his attorney, he wouldn’t be able to prepare the written order and 
made the decision to represent himself moving forward.

J. Father Proceeds Pro Se
Shortly after the court setting, Father terminated the services of his attorney, 
Dan Bacalis, and notified the court (R. 195–197). An agreed motion for withdrawal 
of counsel was subsequently filed (R. 198–202). 
On February 8, 2024, the associate judge’s report dated February 1, 2024, 
was filed into the record (R. 203-209). Around the same time, an agreed order of 
consolidation was entered—consolidating the protective order suit with the divorce 
matter—without Father’s knowledge or signature (R. 210–213). 
In response, Father prepared an Emergency Motion to Vacate, which he filed 
the following day (R. 214–218). The motion included a supporting brief 
summarizing the procedural history and outlining what Father described as 
Mother’s unlawful campaign against him (R. 219–227). The exhibits 
accompanying the motion included text message evidence and data visualizations 
involving Mother, Damen Kazlauskas, and Debbie Price, originally discovered on 
December 12, 2023 (R. 228–689); text messages between Father and Mother’s 
grandfather indicating the divorce was unexpected (R. 690–695); evidence of 
marital asset conversion between Mother and Daniel Branthoover (R. 696–698); 
documentation of the overdrawn joint bank account and related communications 
from Branthoover (R. 699–702, R. 703–706); a copy of the eviction notice served 
by Margie Wilson, which Mother later tore in half and marked “VOID” (R. 708);

A few days later, the court issued the order granting Attorney Bacalis’s 
withdrawal (R. 713–716). Father then prepared and filed a Motion for Partial

To avoid unnecessary conflict, Father temporarily stayed in Flower Mound, Texas, 
with his own father while awaiting the hearing.

L. Setting #4 – Emergency Motion to Vacate and Reconsider Evidence 
Father appeared for the scheduled hearing on his Emergency Motion (R. 
768). Upon entering the courtroom, he was handed a document titled “Temporary 
Orders,” which was a modified version of the February 1, 2024, agreement 
previously prepared by Father’s former counsel (R. 862). These orders were 
prepared by Cooper L. Carter after the 20-day deadline stipulated in the original 
agreement. No agreement had been reached, as evidenced by the parties’ presence 
in court to contest the matter, and no motion to sign had been set or filed—contrary 
to the judge’s prior directive (R. 208). 
The proposed orders also claimed that a hearing had been held on February 
1, 2024, for “Mother’s Motion for Temporary Orders,” and that all parties were in 
agreement with the terms “as evidenced by the signatures below” (R. 863). In 
reality, the February 1 setting resulted only in an associate judge’s report, drafted 
informally in the hallway by Father’s prior counsel. Despite this, the proposed 
order stated that the court “heard evidence and argument”—a statement Father 
asserts was inaccurate. At that time, the only other scheduled hearing was on 
Mother’s Application for Protective Order, which had been non-suited in the 
February 1 Associate Judge’s Report. 
Once the hearing began, Father’s Emergency Motion was denied without 
explanation, and he was ordered to sign the very agreement he had appeared in

court to contest (R. 770). Notably, the order itself contained two distinct sets of 
handwriting, and Father refused to sign the document because he did not agree to 
its terms (R. 900). 
Following the hearing, Father began exploring his appellate remedies and 
drafted a Preparatory Notice for Judicial Review, which he later amended twice 
(R. 772–821). The document provided a detailed account of the parties’ family 
background (R. 782), employment history, and household dynamics (R. 783–790). 
It included a statement of facts segmented into background facts (R. 791–792), 
procedural facts (R. 792–796), and undisputed evidentiary facts (R. 797–800). 
Appended to the filing were affidavits from Father’s business clients attesting to 
his need to remain in the marital residence for professional reasons (R. 825–827, 
R. 828–830, R. 831–833, R. 834–836, R. 837–840, R. 841–843, R. 844–847). 
The disputed Temporary Orders were filed into the record by the clerk on 
March 26, 2024. Father promptly responded by filing a formal Request for 
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law regarding the March 14 decision (R. 
857–861). He then filed a notice of his intent to seek mandamus relief by April 8, 
2024 (R. 902–905).

his need to remain in the marital residence for professional reasons (R. 825-827,
R. 828-830, R. 831-833, R. 834-836, R. 837-840, R. 841-843, R. 844-847).

The disputed Temporary Orders were filed into the record by the clerk on
March 26, 2024. Father promptly responded by filing a formal Request for

857-861). He then filed a notice of his intent to seek mandamus relief by April 8,
2024 (R. 902-905).

M. The Appellate Proceedings
In April 2024, Father prepared a Motion for Emergency Relief directed to the

Second Court of Appeals (R. 954-983) and a Petition for Writ of Mandamus (R.

14

906–953). The Petition was accepted by the appellate court under cause number 02-
24-00149-CV on April 8, 2024, and the trial court was notified of the filing that same 
day (R. 984–985). 
Two days later, Father’s Motion for Emergency Relief and Petition for Writ 
of Mandamus were denied per curiam (R. 986–987). Father then submitted a Motion 
for Rehearing on April 18, 2024 (R. 1003–1020). Six days later, on April 24, 2024, 
Cooper L. Carter filed a Motion for Pre-Trial Conference (R. 988–991), to which 
Father promptly objected (R. 992–998). The following day, Father’s Motion for 
Rehearing was denied by the Second Court of Appeals (R. 999–1001). 
Father moved for en banc reconsideration on April 26, 2024 (R. 1027–1041). 
On April 30, 2024, although Father continued to disagree with the Temporary Orders 
and the hardship they imposed, he abided by the court’s directives and filed a Notice 
of Completion regarding the court-ordered parenting class, which both parties were 
required to complete by May 1, 2024 (R. 1021–1025). The en banc reconsideration 
motion was denied the following day (R. 1042). 
Father then prepared a second Petition for Writ of Mandamus before this 
Court, which was accepted under cause number 24-0395. The trial court was notified 
of the filing by postcard (R. 1043–1048). 
On May 9, 2024, Cooper L. Carter emailed Father requesting his signature on 
an Income Withholding Order and still claimed that the orders were agreed (R.

1090). Father reviewed the proposed order, determined that it was defective (R. 
1092–1096), and communicated his objections to Ms. Carter (R. 1091). 
N. Intervention From the Texas Attorney General’s Office  
 
    
Subsequently, an intervention pleading was filed by the Office of the Attorney 
General, seeking relief from the trial court regarding child support obligations (R. 
1073–1079). Father objected to this intervention (R. 1080–1088). Notably, upon 
examining the pleading purportedly filed by “Holly Hayes,” Father observed that 
the signature line did not match the name of the listed attorney of record. 
Additionally, the font sizes in the document appeared inconsistent, suggesting that 
the signature may have been irregular (R. 1077). No further correspondence was 
filed by the Attorney General’s Office in this matter. 
 
By July 2024, during Father’s designated month for visitation under the 
disputed orders, he stayed in an Airbnb near the marital home to maintain stability 
for the children and worked with the host to attempt to establish a source of 
business revenue (R. 1712–1722). 
On August 30, 2024, this Court declined to hear Father’s mandamus petition, 
and the trial court was notified (R. 1132–1137). Immediately following the denial, 
Father prepared a Motion for Rehearing, which he submitted in mid-September (R. 
1111–1131). The court was notified of the rehearing filing (R. 1138–1143). The

Petition for Writ of Mandamus was subsequently amended on September 16, 2024 
(R. 1110–1131). 
O. Challenge to Opposing Counsel’s Authority Under Rule 12
After filing the Motion for Rehearing with this Court, Father served 
discovery requests on the opposing party, including Requests for Production of 
Documents (R. 1386–1387) and Requests for Admissions (R. 1387–1391). In 
addition, Father filed a motion under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12, 
challenging Cooper L. Carter’s authority to represent Mother in the trial court (R. 
1144–1152). 
This challenge was based on ambiguity surrounding Ms. Carter’s employment 
status and the fact that her pleadings were being filed by Roderick D. Marx—an 
individual who was not listed as counsel of record and not a party to the case (R. 
194, R. 991). 
                        P. Declining Resources and Exhaustion of Remedies
Facing rapidly declining credit, reduced income (R. 1693–1694), and limited 
housing options, Father filed an Emergency Motion for Temporary Orders on 
September 24, 2024, requesting relief by October 1, 2024 (R. 1158–1170). When 
no relief was granted and no response was received from the opposing party, Father 
filed a motion seeking the joint recusal of Judge James Munford and Associate 
Judge Jeff Kaitcer. The motion asserted that the nature of Mother’s initial

Petition for Writ of Mandamus was subsequently amended on September 16, 2024
(R. 1110-1131).

After filing the Motion for Rehearing with this Court, Father served
discovery requests on the opposing party, including Requests for Production of

no relief was granted and no response was received from the opposing party, Father

allegations had created an appearance of bias that could undermine fairness in the 
proceedings (R. 1171–1195). 
Q. The First Recusal – Procedural Abnormalities
Two days after the recusal motion was filed, Judge James Munford declined 
to recuse himself without explanation and referred the matter to the Honorable 
David L. Evans, the 8th Administrative Regional Judge of Fort Worth (R. 1196–
1197). Upon reviewing this referral, Father observed that the version of the motion 
submitted to Judge Evans differed significantly from the one he originally filed (R. 
1198–1218). Father’s original filing was a single, 20.21 MB hyperlinked PDF 
submitted via the re:SearchTX platform (R. 1229). The version transmitted to 
Judge Evans was missing exhibits and the supporting affidavit. Father notified the 
court coordinator of the discrepancy and noted that the file was approximately 18 
MB smaller (R. 1229–1230). Receiving no response, Father filed a formal notice 
with the court outlining these procedural irregularities (R. 1220–1227). 
The following day, Judge Munford issued an amended order of referral and 
again declined to recuse, without explanation (R. 1256–1258). This time, the 
recusal motion was divided into three separate files, with the court citing the "size 
of the motion" as justification (R. 1332). Father objected to the handling of the 
recusal process (R. 1243–1249), noting that the Tarrant County District Clerk’s 
publicly available filing guidelines instruct litigants to compile all exhibits into a

allegations had created an appearance of bias that could undermine fairness in the
proceedings (R. 1171-1195).
Q. The First Recusal — Procedural Abnormalities

Two days after the recusal motion was filed, Judge James Munford declined
to recuse himself without explanation and referred the matter to the Honorable
David L. Evans, the 8th Administrative Regional Judge of Fort Worth (R. 1196—
1197). Upon reviewing this referral, Father observed that the version of the motion
submitted to Judge Evans differed significantly from the one he originally filed (R.
1198-1218). Father’s original filing was a single, 20.21 MB hyperlinked PDF
submitted via the re:SearchTX platform (R. 1229). The version transmitted to
Judge Evans was missing exhibits and the supporting affidavit. Father notified the
court coordinator of the discrepancy and noted that the file was approximately 18
MB smaller (R. 1229-1230). Receiving no response, Father filed a formal notice
with the court outlining these procedural irregularities (R. 1220-1227).

The following day, Judge Munford issued an amended order of referral and
again declined to recuse, without explanation (R. 1256-1258). This time, the
recusal motion was divided into three separate files, with the court citing the "size
of the motion" as justification (R. 1332). Father objected to the handling of the
recusal process (R. 1243-1249), noting that the Tarrant County District Clerk’s

publicly available filing guidelines instruct litigants to compile all exhibits into a

18

single document (R. 1247 at 9). He also noted that his original 20.21 MB file was 
well within the platform’s approximately 30 MB capacity and that fragmenting the 
submission contradicted the court’s standard electronic filing protocol (R. 1246 at 
6–7). 
R. The First Recusal – the Appointment of Justice Lee Gabriel 
 
Activity paused until October 18, 2024, when the parties received postcard 
notification that Father’s Supreme Court Motion for Rehearing had been denied 
(R. 1268–1273). Three days later, Judge David L. Evans issued an order setting a 
video conference regarding the recusal motion for October 30, 2024 (R. 1274–
1277). On the day before the conference, Judge Evans appointed retired Justice 
Lee Gabriel to preside over the recusal matter (R. 1281–1284). 
During the scheduled video conference, internet connectivity issues arose, 
and the hearing was rescheduled to November 7, 2024, to be held in person at the 
322nd District Court. In anticipation of possible objections from opposing 
counsel—who had not filed a response to the recusal motion—Father filed a Pre-
Trial Motion in Limine to prevent interruptions during his presentation and to 
reiterate key facts of the case (R. 1285–1291). 
Two days later, Father submitted a Request for Confirmation of Procedural 
Requirements, respectfully asking the district clerk to provide a certified copy of

S. The First Recusal – Dental Emergency 
On the morning of the rescheduled in-person hearing, November 7, 2024, 
Father awoke experiencing significant dental distress, which he promptly 
communicated to his father (R. 1367–1368), opposing counsel and the court 
coordinator via email (R. 1370), and to Mother directly (R. 1372). Opposing 
counsel agreed by email to reschedule the hearing due to the emergency (R. 1369). 
Nonetheless, four days later, on November 11, 2024, the court coordinator 
disseminated via email an order signed by Justice Gabriel denying Father’s recusal 
motion. The order specifically referenced Father’s absence from the November 7 
hearing but made no mention of the dental emergency (R. 1372). In response, 
Father filed a Motion to Enter Judgment on November 13, 2024, in which he 
articulated objections to the procedural irregularities surrounding the recusal 
proceedings (R. 1301–1326). This motion was supported by an affidavit 
elaborating upon those irregularities (R. 1322–1325). 
Shortly thereafter, Father filed a Notice of Intent to Remove the case to 
federal court, citing exhaustion of state judicial remedies and setting forth 
jurisdictional grounds for removal to the U.S. District Court for the Northern 
District of Texas (R. 1347–1364).

On November 18, 2024, Father also submitted a Motion to Compel 
Discovery (R. 1374–1383) pertaining to discovery requests initially served on 
Mother on September 17, 2024, attached as Exhibit A (R. 1384–1394). He 
requested that the court deem the requested admissions conclusively established by 
operation of law due to Mother’s failure to respond (R. 1381). 
The recusal proceedings concluded when the court formally documented and 
served the order denying Father’s recusal motion on November 19, 2024 (R. 1398–
1400). At that point, the parties awaited formal confirmation of the termination of 
Justice Lee Gabriel’s assignment, as such termination would not effectuate “…until 
the undersigned Presiding Judge has terminated this assignment in writing.” (R. 
1282. 
T. Federal Removal, Remand, and Initiation of Proceedings Against Daniel 
Kenneth Branthoover 
Following the denial of the recusal motion, Father spent the next two weeks 
compiling the necessary record in preparation for federal removal. On December 2, 
2024, he filed a Notice of Removal with the state trial court (R. 1401–1420). Two 
days later, however, the United States District Court remanded the matter back to 
state court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. 
On December 14, 2024, Dan Branthoover sent Father a threatening text 
message (R. 1695–1696). At that point, Father’s financial losses had exceeded

$75,000 (R. 1435–1439), prompting him to initiate separate federal litigation 
against Daniel Branthoover in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of 
Oklahoma. That action sought damages arising from Mr. Branthoover’s 
involvement in the events underlying this case (R. 1426–1440). 
Father provided notice of the related federal case to the state trial court on 
December 31, 2024 (R. 1420–1425). The federal complaint was filed pursuant to 
28 U.S.C. § 1332(a) (R. 1428), and its statement of facts closely mirrored those 
presented in the current matter (R. 1428–1432). 
U. Case Abandonment 
The divorce case remained largely inactive until January 16, 2025, when 
Father submitted a comprehensive Case Memorandum and served copies upon 
Judges James Munford and Jeff Kaitcer of the 322nd Judicial District Court, 
Visiting Retired Justice Lee Gabriel, Regional Judge David L. Evans, and opposing 
counsel Cooper L. Carter (R. 1441–1495). On January 26, 2025, Father filed a 
Motion to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution, citing the lack of activity in the case by 
the opposing party and the Court’s time standards for divorce proceedings (R. 
1502–1508). 
On January 29, 2025, facing the imminent repossession of his primary 
vehicle, Father returned to the matrimonial residence to retrieve his secondary 
vehicle. Inside, he discovered numerous personal items that Mother had placed in

the vehicle. He temporarily relocated these items to the porch (R. 1604–1606). 
Upon returning the next day to collect the children for his scheduled possession, 
Father observed that Mother had moved the items from the porch to the curb (R. 
1607). 
No further docket activity occurred until February 25, 2025, when Father 
filed a Notice of Loss of Employment, notifying the court of a significant reduction 
in income (R. 1496–1499). At the same time, he submitted a Motion to Sign, 
requesting a ruling on his long-pending Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, 
which had remained unresolved since its original filing on February 22, 2024 (R. 
1612–1629), and which the court acknowledged during the March 14, 2024, 
hearing (R. 1345). Father also filed an Objection and Request for Judicial Notice, 
recapping relevant procedural history and identifying pending matters requiring 
rulings (R. 1635–1653). 
On February 28, 2025, Father filed a Request for Ruling on his outstanding 
motions (R. 1654–1661). On March 5, 2025, he submitted a Notice of New 
Information, documenting Watauga Police Department involvement regarding his 
personal property being placed at the curb by Mother (R. 1662–1666). On March 
12, 2025, Father filed a Notice of Continued Obstruction, itemizing pending, 
unopposed motions and emphasizing the ongoing lack of response from opposing 
counsel (R. 1905–1913). He reinforced these concerns on March 14, 2025, through

a Notice of Submission, restating the uncontested factual background and the 
judicial inaction on multiple unresolved filings (R. 1919–1931). 
By March 18, 2025, Father contacted the court coordinator via email, 
highlighting that neither Judge Munford nor Judge Kaitcer had been formally 
reinstated to preside over the case, despite Justice Gabriel’s denial of recusal being 
entered nearly four months earlier (R. 2730). In light of the continued judicial 
inactivity, and being confident in his understanding of dominant jurisdiction based 
on the extensive record, Father initiated a new Original Suit Affecting the Parent-
Child Relationship (SAPCR) in the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County, 
submitting a cover letter explaining his need for immediate relief for himself and 
his minor children (R. 2235–2252). 
V. The SAPCR Suit and the Sudden Reappearance of Counsel 
 
On March 18, 2025, the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County accepted 
Father’s original SAPCR petition (R. 2029–2040). Concurrently filed was an 
Emergency Application for Injunctive Relief, which reiterated the facts of the 
matter to date (R. 2606–2636). The application included several exhibits: the 
affidavit of inability filed by Mother on December 18, 2023 (R. 1640–1652), 
materials reflecting the conversion of marital assets (R. 2653–2657), the original 
divorce petition (R. 2658–2668), the protective order application (R. 2669–2674), 
documentation of Dan Branthoover’s involvement (R. 2675–2680), the current

temporary orders which claimed consent but lacked Father’s signature (R. 2681–
2720), the eldest child’s declining grades (R. 2721–2722), and evidence of the 
youngest child’s untreated dental cavity (R. 2723–2724). 
Shortly thereafter, Mother reappeared in the litigation and filed a general 
denial in response to the SAPCR petition (R. 2254–2258). This pleading was 
submitted on behalf of Cooper L. Carter by Roderick D. Marx (R. 2258). Mr. Marx 
subsequently filed a motion to consolidate the SAPCR matter back into the original 
divorce case in the 322nd District Court (R. 2259–2262), again purporting to act 
on Ms. Carter’s behalf (R. 2262). 
Father moved to strike both the general denial and the motion to consolidate 
(R. 1932–1937), and attached an exhibit showing that opposing counsel was 
registered under a different law firm than what appeared on her pleadings. (R. 
1938–1939). Father also filed a second Rule 12 Motion challenging Cooper L. 
Carter’s authority to represent Mother in the 233rd District Court, citing Ms. 
Carter’s continued failure to formally appear and the repeated filings by Mr. Marx 
in her name (R. 2267–2276). As of the date of this filing, no response has been 
submitted to any of these pleadings.

Restraining Order (TRO, seeking to prevent Mother from restricting his access 
to the family residence and to safeguard the children (R. 2277–2307). The TRO 
incorporated the same statement of facts that remains unopposed in multiple 
pleadings (R. 2280–2288). Father then coordinated with court staff to schedule the 
presentation of his emergency motion and documented all communications (R. 
2308–2341). 
 
In those communications, Father first inquired about the status of his request 
and informed the court that the opposing party had been notified of the substance 
of the relief sought (R. 2314). The clerk advised that in-person presentation was 
required, and Father requested to appear between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. on March 28, 
2025, again confirming that the opposing party had been served (R. 2315). Father 
delivered the intended materials to opposing counsel in advance of that 
presentation (R. 2327), and the clerk confirmed the scheduled time (R. 2315).  
 
On March 28, 2025, Father appeared before the court coordinator, who assisted in 
securing opposing counsel’s agreement to set the TRO hearing for April 10, 2025, 
from among the available dates (R. 2334). The coordinator initialed the scheduling 
notice to reflect that agreement (R. 2337). Father then proceeded to present the 
motion to the Honorable Kate Stone, who summarily declined to hear it based 
solely on a prospective objection communicated by Mother’s counsel—who was 
not even present in court (R. 2328). Even the coordinator acknowledged that the

2342–2345). In response, Father filed a Pre-Objection to Transfer in the 233rd 
District Court (R. 2060–2063) realizing that the case would need to be transferred 
at some point along with a Notice of New Information advising the court that 
Mother was now engaged to Damen Kazlauskas—the individual with whom she 
exchanged extensive messages at the outset of this case (R. 1995–2000). Father

(R. 2001-2028). Directly after this mandamus was submitted to the Second Court
of Appeals, District Judge Kenneth Newell sua sponte granted Mother’s Motion to

The following day, Father filed a third Petition for Writ of Mandamus, 
naming the Honorable Kenneth Newell as Respondent under cause number 02-25-
00171-CV (“the Consolidation Mandamus”) for his arbitrary grant of Mother’s 
contested motion without a hearing (R. 2199–2224). On the same day, Father’s 
second mandamus petition was denied per curiam. By April 17, 2025, all three 
mandamus petitions had been denied per curiam, and Father moved for 
reconsideration en banc in all three matters (R. 2424–2443; R. 2179–2193; R.

implicated in three distinct abuses of discretion within the same family law matter. 
Y. The Sudden Move to Final Trial  
On April 23, 2025, with all three mandamus petitions pending, Father 
received a Notice of Court Proceeding scheduling a conference for April 29, 2025,

these orders, Father filed a Plea to the Jurisdiction asking the Honorable James 
Munford to clarify the legal basis for the current orders (R. 2444–2454). In a 
further effort to protect his procedural rights, Father filed a Second Motion to 
Recuse Judge Munford on April 25, 2025 (R. 1763–1784). Later that same day, 
Mother notified Father that the emergency circumstance which had formed the 
original basis for Father’s urgent push for the Emergency TRO petition had now 
materialized (R. 1742–1747). 
With this new development, Father filed a Notice of Non-Appearance and 
Objection to Trial Setting (R. 2456–2462) and amended his pending Motion to 
Recuse (R. 2463–2501). Despite the allegations and the procedural defects raised, 
Judge Munford declined to recuse himself for a second time without any 
substantive explanation (R. 2585–2589). 
Separately, the Honorable Jeff Kaitcer—though not named in the recusal 
motion—filed a voluntary recusal from the case (R. 2590–2594). In response, 
Father filed an Objection to Procedural Handling of the Recusal Proceedings,

application, an action Relator contends was an abuse of discretion and left him 
without an adequate remedy. Finally, the third petition challenges orders entered by 
an Associate Judge in the divorce proceeding, which Relator argues were entered 
without authority and are void for want of consent and an overreach of statutory 
jurisdiction. 
II. Prevention of Conflicting Rulings and Ensuring Comprehensive Relief 
Given the interconnectedness of the factual and legal issues, there is a 
potential for piecemeal or even conflicting adjudications if the petitions are 
considered in isolation. Consolidation will ensure that any relief granted is 
comprehensive and addresses the root causes of the alleged injustices. The 
Supreme Court’s broad discretion in matters of consolidation and severance, as 
discussed in cases like Pierce v. Reynolds, 160 Tex. 198, 329 S.W.2d 76 (1959), 
and Buttery v. Betts, 422 S.W.2d 149 (Tex. 1967), while primarily addressing trial 
court actions, underscores the judiciary’s power to manage proceedings in a 
manner that promotes fairness and efficiency. Pierce noted that while a single 
cause of action may not properly be divided, an order of severance, even if 
erroneous, effectively separates the controversy until set aside. Id. 329 S.W.2d at 
78–79. Conversely, consolidation here would serve to unify the review of what  
Relator presents as a series of interconnected deprivations of his rights.

Relator further suggests that the Court prioritize review of the mandamus 
petition concerning the void March 14, 2024, temporary orders. See 25-0361. 
Those orders form the foundation for the subsequent judicial actions challenged in

illusion, as the arbiter is the source of the ongoing grievance. A stay is therefore 
essential to prevent the continued erosion of Relator’s parental rights and to ensure 
that the appellate process is not rendered moot by further adverse actions at the 
trial court level. This Court has recognized that appellate review must be available 
to shield parties from potentially erroneous interim orders that could cause 
irreparable harm. See Harley Channelview Props., LLC v. Harley Marine Gulf, 
LLC, No. 23-0078, slip op. at 2 (Tex. May 10, 2024) (reaffirming Qwest Commc’ns 
Corp. v. AT&T Corp., 24 S.W.3d 334, 337 (Tex. 2000) (per curiam)).  
The relief sought by Relator in these mandamus petitions has, to date, not 
been opposed by any party. Given the profound impact on fundamental rights, the 
clear procedural issues raised, and the likely merits of Relator’s position that his 
rights are being violated, a stay is imperative to restore Relator’s rights pending 
this Court’s review. An urgent need exists for such protection to be in place by May 
16th, to prevent further irreparable harm given the Relator’s imminent risk of 
homelessness. A consolidation and a stay would give this court time to review this 
matter, and would immediately restore Relator’s rights that have caused significant 
damage to his business, livelihood, and relationship with his Children.  
All parties are aware of the relief being sought by the Relator, and have been 
for several months – yet no substantive Response has been provided. Relator’s 
rights were so easily taken at the onset – they should be as easily vindicated here.

Conclusion 
For the foregoing reasons, the Relator respectfully submits that 
consolidation of the three pending mandamus petitions is not only appropriate but 
essential for a just and efficient resolution. Furthermore, an immediate stay of the 
underlying proceedings is urgently required to protect the Relator’s rights. The 
interconnected factual and legal issues, the overarching concerns for Relator’s 
parental rights and due process, the need for judicial economy, the prevention of 
potentially conflicting outcomes, and the risk of continued irreparable harm all 
strongly militate in favor of consolidation and the granting of a stay. Such actions 
will enable this Honorable Court to conduct a comprehensive review and provide 
meaningful relief if the alleged abuses of discretion are substantiated without 
further harm being sustained in the interim. 
Prayer for Expedited Relief 
Wherefore, premises considered, Relator Charles Dustin Myers respectfully prays 
that this Honorable Court provide the following relief: 
1. Grant this Motion to Consolidate the three original proceedings for writ of
mandamus currently pending before the Court, as each arises from the same
underlying family law controversy and involves overlapping factual and
legal questions;

2. Immediately grant and issue the pending temporary stay of the underlying
trial court proceedings pursuant to Tex. R. App. P. 52.10(b) to restore
Relator’s rights pending the outcome, prevent further irreparable harm, and
ensure the effectiveness of any mandamus relief this Court may ultimately
grant should no response be submitted by May 16, 2025;
3. Prioritize review of the mandamus petition challenging the void temporary
orders entered by the Honorable Jeff Kaitcer on March 14, 2024, as such
orders form the foundation for subsequent judicial actions challenged in the
related proceedings;
4. Adopt the proposed framework for consolidated record consideration with
distinct adjudication of the relief sought in each petition;
5. And for such other and further relief, at law or in equity, to which Relator
may be justly entitled.
