STATEMENT OF THE CASE 
Nature of the Case:  The underlying suit is a divorce 
Respondents: 
Respondents’ actions: 
proceeding initiated by Mother 
overseen by two separate Judges 
which waived the 60-day waiting 
period due to an alleged active 
order of protection against the 
Father and was consolidated with a 
protective order claiming 
harassment and sexual harassment 
from the Relator. 
Respondents are Hon. James 
Munford, presiding District Judge 
& Hon. Jeffrey N. Kaitcer, 
presiding Associate Judge of the 
322nd District Court of Tarrant 
County, Texas.  
Both respondents contributed to 
the removal of an active and 
involved father from his 
children's lives, lacking judicial 
oversight and disregarding the 
facts, thereby destabilizing the 
children's lives, and overlooking 
the father's significant role. 
This approach not only enabled the 
mother's frivolous litigation but 
also cast a long shadow on the 
children's future by prioritizing 
unsubstantiated claims over the 
well-being and stability of the 
family.

SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT

The actions taken by DJ Respondent and AJ
Respondent represent a clear abuse of discretion,
violating the explicit statutory mandates of the Texas
Family Code concerning the issuance of orders affecting
conservatorship and support, without due notice anda

formal hearing.

DJ Respondent overstepped by appointing the Mother

as primary managing conservator of the children during

23

=== PAGE 24 ===
--- EXTRACTED TEXT ---
24 
 
a protective order hearing, sidestepping the critical 
procedural requirement for evidence presentation and 
witness testimony. This contravenes TEX. FAM. CODE § 
105.001(b), which mandates that orders under 
subsections (a)(1), (2), or (5) — directly relevant to 
conservatorship — cannot be rendered absent notice and 
a  hearing. By preemptively assigning conservatorship 
to the Mother under TEX. FAM. CODE § 105.001(a)(1), DJ 
Respondent disregarded these statutory obligations, 
underscoring an unequivocal abuse of discretion. 
Similarly, AJ Respondent compounded this disregard 
for statutory requirements on January 22nd, 2024. With 
the expiration of DJ Respondent’s orders, AJ Respondent 
enacted temporary orders affecting the conservatorship 
of the children and Father’s access to his residence, 
all without the benefit of a hearing, attributed to the 
Mother's last-minute retention of counsel. This action 
flouts the same legal requirement for notice and a 
hearing as outlined in TEX. FAM. CODE § 105.001(b), 
highlighting a systemic breach of due process.

The infringement continued on February 1st, 2024, 
with AJ Respondent’s ratification of the Agreed 
Associate Judge’s Report, prepared by the Father’s 
attorney, concerning “the temporary conservatorship of 
the children” and “temporary support of the children” 
as per TEX. FAM. CODE §§ 105.001(a)(1) & (a)(2). The 
stipulation that such orders must not be rendered 
without a prior hearing, as per TEX. FAM. CODE §
105.001(b), was once again overlooked. This neglect 
forced the Father into agreeing to conditions without 
the foundational due process, further compelling his 
termination of legal counsel and challenging the orders 
on March 14th—a challenge that was met with denial, 
which leads the Relator to this petition of mandamus, 
where he must climb Mount Everest without oxygen to 
preserve the stability of his Children that was swiftly

conservatorship, possession, and access. The Temporary 
Orders filed on March 26th, 2024, not only lacked a 
substantial evidentiary basis but also failed to

ARGUMENT 
 
A. AVAILABILITY OF MANDAMUS RELIEF 
Mandamus is an appropriate remedy for a parent to 
attack the issuance of temporary orders in a custody 
proceeding, since such orders are not subject to 
interlocutory appeal. Dancy v. Daggett, 815 S.W.2d 
548, 549 (Tex. 1991) (per curiam).  
A writ of mandamus is the correct recourse when the 
trial court exhibits an abuse of discretion and there 
is no other adequate legal remedy available, such as 
an appeal. In re Prudential Insurance Company of 
America, 148 S.W.3d 124, 135-36 (Tex. 2004)

Mandamus iS an appropriate remedy for a parent to
attack the issuance of temporary orders in a custody

B. Issue No. 1 
The District Judge prematurely removed the Father 
from his home, business, and children's lives 
without a formal hearing, and the Associate Judge 
extended this separation by granting a continuance 
due to the Mother's last-minute acquisition of 
counsel, exacerbating the Father’s unjust removal, 
and disregarding due process and the children’s best 
interests. 
The Texas Family Code provides that “after notice 
and hearing, the court may render an appropriate 
order, including the granting of a temporary 
injunction for the preservation of the property and 
protection of the parties as deemed necessary and 
equitable.” Id § 6.502(a). Considering no witnesses 
were called or evidence produced at the initial 
appearance on January 16th, 2024, the necessity of 
such significant actions was unreasonable.

PRAYER

Wherefore premises considered, for all the

foregoing reasons alleged and briefed herein, Relator

C.D.M. prays that this court grant him mandamus relief

and order AJ Respondent to vacate the current temporary

orders that have no factual backing, thereby restoring

business, and restoring the stability the Children have

always known while the case is pending and until the
Relator can have a reasonable amount of time to

transition from the family home.

Relator C.D.M. further requests that this court

grant him such other relief both general and special,

at law or in equity, to which he may show himself to be

Relator notes the absence of a court-reported record 
for this case, significantly hindering the ability to 
provide a verbatim transcript of proceedings crucial to 
this mandamus action. Notably, the only witness called 
during these proceedings was the mother, primarily for 
securing legal fees for the March 14th motion for 
reconsideration. This unique circumstance, compounded 
by the lack of a court reporter, accentuates the need 
for the Court's detailed review of the attached 
appendix. This appendix, containing all relevant 
documents filed in compliance with statutory 
requirements and unopposed to date, forms the core 
evidence for the Court's consideration. Despite these 
procedural anomalies, the Relator believes the 
submitted documents will sufficiently support the 
Petition for Writ of Mandamus.
