Morgan and Cooper,
It's now February 26, 2025, and the following relevant motions remain un-opposed:
1. Summary judgement (02/2024)
2. Request for discovery and admissions (09/2024)
3. Motion for Temporary orders (09/2024)
3. Rule 12 motion (09/2024)
4. Motion to dismiss (01/2025)
Additionally, there has been no defenses raised to any claims made against Morgan, there have been no pleadings filed
in response, and there doesn't exist a legal avenue for you to prevail on the merits without violating due process.
I'm not sure what your end-game is, but the longer this takes - the worse it gets.
I have filed three complaints with the CJC against Judge Munford, Judge Kaitcer, and Justice Gabriel, and have contacted
the Texas Rangers regarding Lindsey Baker's involvement in the recusal process. (document tampering).
Given the amount of time that it would take to pursue relief from the United States Supreme Court, that is not a feasible
option considering the financial damages caused by this situation grow each month.
Total damages, which will be supported by evidence, some of which has already been provided to you, now exceeds over
$100,000 and I just wanted to remind you both that what you're doing is not only unethical, but certain conduct has been
illegal.
There isn't even enough courtesy to respond to emails, and Morgan has shown no ability to act in the best interests of the
children.
So how did we get here?
MORGAN: 
It started with an affair, and then at the first opportunity, Morgan went on a frenzy to try and escape accountability only to
then bring the male figure she texted over 6,500 times within a year around the children, and now declares him as her
"boyfriend" despite making no effort to prosecute the case.
During this frenzy, she enlisted the help of her now stepfather, Dan Branthoover, who is being sued in the Western District
of Oklahoma for his involvement. She also enlisted the help of her grandparents to attempt to have me evicted, falsified
an affidavit of inability to pay where she claimed both vehicles as her financial responsibility, a willful lie. 
Further, she claimed that an active order of protection existed against me and that family violence was found to have
occurred during the marriage, another willful lie.
Finally, she claimed to be indigent directly after converting $1,576 of marital funds via Dan's PayPal account on December
15, 2023, after seeking an ex-parte order of protection on December 14, 2023.
Despite already claiming to have an active order, the then proceeded to request another protective order on December
22nd, 2023, which claimed family violence occurred, another willful lie, which led to my unjust, unlawful, unwarranted
removal from the home which I had lived in for the last eight years, and where I paid rent for the majority of the time.

She then sat around for six months, watching as the children's lives deteriorated. She moved her sister into the family
home, brought her new lover around the children, and has made no effort to co-parent or prosecute the case.
She gaslights the children into thinking we're anywhere near getting divorced, and now leaves them in the care of
relatives as she finally started to work full time.
COOPER:
Knowing she had no defense or evidence against the claims she made against me initially, she reached approached you
Ms. Carter, on  January 22nd, 2024, in the lobby of the courthouse, and allegedly retained you on-the-fly where a
continuance was granted and the case was reset once again.
You stated in court that you did not wish to represent her in the divorce matter that day, and Judge Kaitcer mandated your
representation. 
This simple fact is why I have not pursued legal action against you for your conduct in this matter, and given the refusal to
respond, participate, or engage in any meaningful way - this gratitude cannot continue.
You're smart enough to know that your actions warrant a suspension and investigation, as you're breaking Texas Law not
only in this case, but several others as well.
You've filed nothing in the case, and rely on a settlement to finalize the divorce.
It won't ever happen.
You both need to look at the bigger picture here. All I've done is try to communicate and do what's best for the kids.
Everyone else - including the Judges, have only tried to escape accountability by pulling the wool over my eyes which
was unsuccessful.
If it's the last thing I do, I will ensure that everyone involved in destroying the beautiful life my children had is held
accountable, custody is rightfully taken from Morgan, be given access back into the home, and given the proper amount
of time to transition out.
Just because your grandma lives nextdoor, Morgan, does not entitle you to destroy a marriage and your own children's
lives. You wanted this divorce - it's time to act like an adult and own up to what you've done, or continue kicking the can
down the road with inaction.
Regardless, your silence says it all. Both about who you are as a parent, a person, and a co-parent, and regarding your
defense in this matter. You have none.
Nobody is above the law, and the long-term consequences of your decisions will wreak havoc on the children later in life
unless the damage can start being mitigated now.
I will keep stacking the docket until the court breaks, and I've formally objected to Lindsey Baker handling the scheduling
of hearings given her involvement with the recusal, so you won't be able to side-step the rules of procedure, Cooper, and
get hearings or status conferences set without a formal motion filed through the EFM, something which you cannot do.
If you try to schedule any hearing, it will be objected to given you have yet to prove your authority to represent the
petitioner in this matter.
Just a friendly reminder - I'm not going away.
This will not end.
Justice will be served, and the law is on my side.
The time it takes is up to you. Just know that every day - I am reaching out to organizations, media outlets, and will attack
this from every possible angle until the truth of the matter is exposed.
One way or another, justice will be served.
If I'm wrong here, then you'll need to show it either legally or substantively.
Otherwise, the case is already closed, and you both are risking quite a lot in your own personal lives by prolonging a case
you both know is unwinnable.
