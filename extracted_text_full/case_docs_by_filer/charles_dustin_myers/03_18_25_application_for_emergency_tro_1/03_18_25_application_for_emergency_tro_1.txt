1 NO. ___________  
IN THE 322ND DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, 
TEXAS  
I. P
ARTIES AND JURISDICTION
A.Petitioner  and Next Friend
1. Charles Dustin Myers (“ Petitioner ”) is the father of two minor children,
M.E.M., aged eight, C.R.M., aged five,  (“the Children”). The Children are under 18 and
have no court-appointe d guardian in this matter. P etitioner brings t his suit as Next Friend 
of the Chi
ldren pursuant t o Texas Rule of Ci vil Procedure 44, which permits mi nors 
without a legal guardian to sue through a next friend. P etitioner  also br ings claims in h is 
i
ndividual  capacity as the Children’s biological father. 
2. Petitioner notes tha t related cause number 322-744263-23, a suit for the
dissolution of marriage, is procedurally stalled with the Respondent name d in the instant 
case, Morgan Michelle Myers, being unable to prosecute her case. The current orders in 
the related divorce matter, reflect facially void orders that claim all parties agree, yet theyCHARLES DUSTIN MYERS,  
   petitioner and next friend of M.E.M 
and C.R.M., two minor children  
vs. PETITIONER’S ORIGINAL 
PETITION AND APPLICATION 
FOR EMERGENCY INJUNCTIVE 
RELIEF  
MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS,  
   respondent

2 were rendered without the consent of both parties on March 14, 2024. Thus, the orders 
have no legal effect, and the children have no legally effectuated managing conservator despite being under the court’s continuous jurisdiction. Therefore, Petitioner’s initiation of this suit on behalf of the minor children, M.E.M and C.R.M. as Next Friend to restore their status quo is appropriate and aligns with their best interests, Texas State policy, and the Texas Family Code.  
B.Respondent  Morgan Michelle Myers
3. Respondent Morgan Michelle Myers (“Morgan” or “Defendant”) is an
individual residing in Tarrant County, Texas. She is the mother of the Children and Petitioner ’s spouse. Morgan may be served with process at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, 
Texas 76148, which is the matrimonial home.  
C.Third Party  Defendant Dan Branthoover
4. Defendant Dan Branthoover is an individual who  resides in Yukon, Oklahoma.
Branthoover is a relative of Morgan who, as detailed below, assisted her in the wrongful acts against Petitioner  and the Children. Once liability is established, Branthoover is 
subject to personal jurisdiction in Texas under the Texas long- arm statute because he 
committed tortious acts in whole or in part in Texas  that give rise to this suit. 
Specifically, Branthoover actively aided Morgan’s fraudulent court filings and interference with the Petitioner ’s parental rights  in Texas, causing injury in Texas, and 
thus “committed a tort in whole or in part in this state” per Tex. Civ. Prac . & Rem. Code 
§ 17.042(2). He may be served pursuant to Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 17.044 byserving the Texas Secretary of State, or by any other method authorized by law, as his

3 acts constitute doing business in Texas. Petitioner will move to include Branthoover as a 
party to this matter when procedurally appropriate. 
D.Jurisdiction
5. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this cause. The amount in
controversy exceeds the minimum jurisdictional limits of this Court. More importantly, 
the Court has jurisdiction under Texas Family Code § 42.002, which expressly authorizes a civil action  for interference with possessory interests in a child . The Court 
also has jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief to protect the best interests of the Children, as this suit directly impacts the parent-child relationship. Petitioner  further inv okes this 
Court’s equitable power to remedy fraud on the court and to protect the welfare of minor children. 
E.Venue
6.Venue is proper in Tarrant County , Texas. The Children reside in Tarrant
County, and Defendant Morgan resides in Tarrant County. Many of the wrongful acts occurred in Tarrant County (including fraudulent filings in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant Count y). Here, a related Suit Affecting the Parent -Child Relationship (the divorce 
and custody proceeding) is pending in Tarrant County (Cause No. 322-744263-23 in the 322nd Judicial District). Filing in this venue serves the interests of justice and efficie ncy. 
F.St
anding and Capacity
7.Petitioner , as the Children’s biological father and Next Friend, is authorized to
bring claims on their behalf . He has a justiciable interest in the custody and well -being 
of the Children. The Children have standing through Petitioner  to seek relief for the

4 harms they have suffered due t o Respondent’s conduct. Petitioner  also has standing on 
behalf of his children and in his own right to seek redress for the violation of his parental 
rights and the personal damage he sustained  leading to emotional conflict for the children 
and himself. 
II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Morgan Michelle Myers, Respondent and Danielle Kenneth Branthoover, Defendant, are 
collectively referred to as “Defendants”.  
G.Summary of the Dispute
8. This case arises from an unprecedented and unjust separation of a father from
his children through fraud and deception upon the courts . On January 16, 2024, the 
322nd District Court of Tarrant County signed an order that ousted Petitioner  from his 
own home and effectively removed him from the Children’s lives . To this day, that 
drastic removal remains unexplained and unjustified, as it was procured by Defendant 
Morgan’s false filings and has never been meaningfully examined. Petitioner  was given 
no real o pportunity to be heard before losing daily contact with his Children. Over a year 
has passed, yet no court has rectified or even addressed the glaring fraud and inconsistencies  underlying the orders that separated a loving father from his kids without 
cause. 
H. Texas Policy Favors Both Parents’ Involvement
9. From the outset, it must be emphasized that Texas public policy “assure[s] that
children will have frequent and continuing contact with parents who have shown the 
ability to act in the best interest of the child.”  (Tex. Fam. Code § 153.001(a)(1)) . The

5 law further provides that “the best interest of the child shall always be the primary 
consideration”  in matters of possession and access (Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002). 
Petitioner  has always acted in the Children’s best interests, as evidenced by his role as 
their primary caregiver and provider prior to court intervention. Yet Defendants’ actions 
have flipped Texas policy on its head – rather than frequent contact with both parents, the Children have been limited to one parent’s custody for over a year, with the other parent (Petitioner) effectively erased from their daily lives . This lawsuit seeks to restore the 
status quo ante  in line with Texas law and the Children’s best interests.  
I. Background – The Marriage and Children
10.Petitioner  and Respondent Morgan were married for eight years and are the
parents of two minor Children (ages 6 and 8). Prior to the events in question, Petitioner  
was a devoted father and the primary caregiver  to the Children. He was also the 
family’s primary breadwinner, ensuring financial stability for the household. The family lived together at their home in Watauga, Texas. The Children enjoyed a loving relationship with Petitioner , who was deeply involved in their daily routine, care, and 
upbringing. There had been no history of family violence or court intervention during the full scope of the marriage.  
J.Morgan’s Sudden Change of Heart and Secret Preparations
11. In early December 2023, without warning, Morgan informed Petitioner  that
she wanted a divorce . Her initial stated reasons were trivial (complaints about how 
Petitioner  talked to her), but soon she began condemning the entire marriage, even 
memories she once cherished . Unbeknownst to Petitioner  at the time, Morgan was

6 already engaged in extramarital relationships  with at least two individuals outside the 
marriage: Debbie Price and Damen Kazlauskas . On or around December 12, 2023, 
Petitioner  discovered phone records showing an enormous volume of communication  
(over 16,500 text messages) between Morgan and these individuals. Confronted with the 
likely exposure of her infidelity and concerned about its implications, Morgan began frantically plotting to remove Petitioner  from the picture . Her goal, as evidenced by 
her actions, was to lock Petitioner  out of the marital home, isolate him from the 
Children, and shield her own wrongdoing from scrutiny . 
K. Fraudulent and Ex Parte Court Filings (December 2023)
12. Between December 14 and December 22, 2023, Morgan – with active help from
Defendant Branthoover – made a series of rushed court filings  in the 322nd District 
Court designed to obtain an upper hand through deceit . These filings were calculated to 
portray Petitioner  as an absent or dangerous spouse and to deprive him of notice or a 
chance to defend himself . In rapid succession, Morgan filed: 
•a. False “Uncontested Case” Representation:  On or about December 18, 2023,  
Morgan submitted a document (for review by a court attorney) falsely indicating  
that the case was “un contested,” implying Petitioner had agreed or would not  
fight. Exhibit 1
13.
Petitioner  had not even been served or informed, and there was no agreement  –
this was a ploy to mislead the court into quicker relief. 
•b. Affidavit of Inability to Pay Court Costs (Pauper’s Oath):  On December 18,
2023, Morgan filed an affidavit claiming she was indigent and unable to afford the

7 ~$400 filing fee for the divorce, asserting that she had only $20 to her name and 
that the Children “relied solely on her income”. Exhibit 2  
14.This statement was a knowing falsehood . In truth, Petitioner  was the primary
financial provider for the family, and Morgan had access to substantial funds. In fact, just days before, on December 16, 2023, Morgan (with Branthoover’s guidance) transferred $1,576.00 in joint marital funds into a new personal bank account under her control  
using Branthoover’s PayPal as a method to obscure her banking information. Morgan admitted in text messages with Branthoover that she moved these funds, and bank records later confirmed it . Thus, at the time she swore she was penni less, she was in possession 
of significant community assets. She also grossly misrepresented her expenses in that affidavit – claiming she alone paid the mortgage/rent and car loans – when in fact Petitioner  had been paying those bills  and continued to pay them. (Notably, one of the 
vehicles Petitioner  was paying for has been repossessed by the dealer due to financial 
hardship.) These glaring contradictions  in Morgan’s pauper’s affidavit demonstrate 
perjury and fraud upon the court. Exhibit 3 . 
Morgan’ s divorce case should never have even been docketed without fees, given her deceit . 
•c. Original Petition for Divorce with Inconsistent Allegations:  Also on
December 18, 2023, Morgan filed an Original Petition for Divorce. In it, shemade convoluted and contradictory statements regarding a protective order.
She alleged that she had applied for a protective order on December 14 that was“undecided,” yet simultaneously claimed an “active” protective order finding

8 family violence was in place (apparently to invoke a 60-day waiting period waiver 
for divorce). Exhibit 4  
15. Both cannot be true; this inconsistency should have been a red flag. Furthermore,
if an active protective order truly existed, Texas law (Tex. Fam. Code § 6.405(b)) required Morgan to attach a copy of it to her petition . She attached no such order, 
because none existed – the “active” protective order was a fiction . In short, Morgan was 
telling the court whatever was convenient at the moment, truth be damned. 
•d. Application for Protective Order (Second Attempt):  On December 22, 2023,
Morgan filed yet another request – an Application for a Protective Order – in the322nd District Court. Exhibit 5
16.This wa s perplexi ng, since just four days earlier she had implied she already ha d a
protective order. The second application underscores tha t Morgan was “bent on  
amas
sing m ultiple orders” against Petitioner without justification. The Applicati on w as 
based on allegations of “family violence” by P etitioner , but no cr edible evidence w as  
ever presented to support such claims. On the very day this second application was filed 
(Dec. 22), Morga n and P etitioner were photographed laughing a nd playing w ith the 
Children toge ther i n the fam i ly h ome – hardly the behavior of someone in imminent 
fear for  her safety. M organ’s own contemporaneous text messages and photos show a 
normal, even happy, family scene that day. This directly contradicts her sworn claims  
that she needed protection from Petitioner.  Exhibit 5.1
L.
Branthoover’s Involvement

9 17. Defendant Branthoover (Morgan’s relative) played a pivotal role in this
scheme. Immediately after Morgan’s first filing on Dec. 14, she traveled to Yukon, 
Oklahoma – Branthoover’s location – where he “assisted her in preparing subsequent filings designed to achieve the very result we see today —Respondent’s abrupt 
removal from his home.”. Branthoover’s assistance is confirmed by his own admissions via text and is the basis of a pending lawsuit against him in Oklahoma for his role in this fraud . Exhibit 6 In essence, Branthoover acted as a co -conspirator, helping Morgan craft 
and present false evidence to Texas courts. He had actual knowledge  of Morgan’s plans 
and the falsehoods in her filings, yet actively furthered them. Under Texas law, one who aids or assists in the interference with another’s possessory rights in a child is jointly liable  for the damages caused (Tex. Fam. Code § 42.003). Branthoover’s liability in this 
action flows from his knowing aid in Morgan’s tortious conduct. 
M.“Agreed” Temporary Orders
18. Making matters worse, Morgan’s counsel allegedly retained on the spot
drafted “Temporary O rders” following the January 22  reset in related case 322- 744263-
23, which purported to memorialize an agreement or hearing that never truly occurred 
and is not found within the docket sheet. These Temporar y Orders claim that all parties 
“agreed” to t he terms – ye t Petitioner never agr eed  to any such orders, and his signature 
is absent from such. The court ca nnot legally enforce temporary orders that claim to be 
agreed when consent is absent at the time of rendition. Such is the case here, and they 
should be immediately vacated. Exhibit 7
19.No proper he aring was  ever he ld, no e vi dence w as taken, an d Petitioner
never s igned or  approved t hose orders . Indee d, the only signature on the Temporary

10 Orders is Morgan’s and her counsel’s ; Petitioner ’s signature is absent. The orders also 
reference a motion that was never served  on Petitioner . This is clear procedural 
irregularity. These “agreed” Temporary Orders, entered on false pretenses, gave Morgan 
temporary custody of the Children and possession of the home, while barring Petitioner  
from both. By any measure, such orders – obtained without notice, without a genuine hearing, and predicated on false statements of agreement – lack validity . They are void 
ab initio and cannot stand as a barrier to the relief Petitioner  seeks here. Morgan’s misuse 
of the court’s processes to rubber- stamp an unjust arrangement is part and parcel of her 
tortious conduct. 
N.Morgan’s Abdication of the Truth and Procedure
20. After securing the Temporary Orders, Morgan and her attorney effectively
went dark and stonewalled the litigation . They refused to participate in discovery , 
ignored deposition notices, and generally failed to prosecute the divorce on the merits. 
Tellingly, neither Morgan nor her counsel has ever filed any substantive response to Petitioner ’s numerous sworn allegations of fraud in the pending case . They offered no 
rebuttal  to the detailed factual record Petitioner  built demonstrating Morgan’s deceit. 
Morg an’s silence in the face of these accusations is deafening – she could not defend the 
indefensible. Instead, her counsel’s rare court appearances were limited to raising baseless objections aimed at preventing Petitioner  from cross -examining Morgan  or 
exposing the truth. This strategy of “obfuscation and evasion” underscores that Morgan has no legitimate defense for her actions; her plan was simply to run out the clock  
while Petitioner  remained in forced exile from his Children. 
O.Harm to Petitioner  and the Children

11 21. The impact of Defendants’ actions has been devastating and continues to
worsen. Petitioner  lost his family, his home, and even his livelihood  as a direct result of 
the fraudulent orders. Being evicted from his home without notice not only separated him 
from the Children, but also disrupted his business/employment, causing severe financial strain. The family’s previously stable finances have been thrown into chaos. Petitioner  
has incurred substantial expenses fighting these false accusations and attempting to reunite with his Children. He has suffered extreme emotional distress, detailed further below, from the traumatic loss of his role as father and daily caregiver. 
22.The Children  have likewise suffered immensely. They went from having a
loving father present each day to suddenly no contact at all , effectively overnight. This 
abrupt, unexplained loss of a parent’s daily presence has caused the Children profound confusion, anxiety, and emotional pain. They were too young to understand why their father vanished from their lives. Family members (including Morgan’s own relatives) have struggled to explain the situation to the Children, because the truth – that it was al l 
based on lies – was concealed. Instead, the Children have been left with the impression that their father “went away” or did something wrong, which is untrue and damaging to their mental well-being. The Children have essentially been deprived of a parent’s love, guidance, and support for over a year  through no fault of their own.Moreover, during 
this period, Morgan has introduced a new man (Defendant Kazlauskas) into the Children’s lives , spending substantial time with him and even allowing him to take the 
Children places alone. The Children now see this stranger more often than their own 
father .

12 23. This is exactly the kind of harmful disruption in a child’s life that Texas law
seeks to prevent. Texas law prioritizes frequent, meaningful contact between children 
and both parents , yet the Children’s reality is the opposite. As the Texas Supreme Court 
has recognized, children depend on “the positive benefits flowing from parental love, affection, protection, emotional support, services, companionship, care, and society” from both parents . Defendants have callously stripped the Children of these benefit s from 
Petitioner . 
24. In sum, Morgan’s fraudulent actions, aided by Branthoover, have caused
unprecedented and ongoing harm . Petitioner  was the primary caregiver  and a fit, 
loving parent. There was no legitimate reason to remove him. Yet due to Defendants’ tortious conduct, the Children have effectively lost a parent for over a year , and 
Petitioner  has lost irreplaceable time with his kids. This is a human tragedy as much as a 
legal wrong. The facts are largely undisputed – Morgan has never rebutted the evidence of her lies  – and the need for relief is urgent. Every day that passes is another day of 
childhood the Children can never get back with their father. 
25. That being said – Petitioner wishes no ill will toward any Defendant or
participant in this suit – he simply wants what’s right by his children in alignment with Texas law.  
III. CAUSES OF ACTION
Count 1: Tortious Interference with Parental Rights (Interference with 
Possessory Interest in a Child)

13 26.Interference with Possessory Rights:  Petitioner  incorporates the facts above.
Texas law expressly forbids one parent (or any person) from wrongfully depriving 
another parent of his court-ordered possessory rights with respect to a child. Under Texas Family Code § 42.002, “a person who takes or retains possession of a child or who conceals the whereabouts of a child in violation of a possessory right of another person may be liable for damages to that person.” 
27. A “possessory right” defined in the Family Code includes a court -ordered
right of possession or access, as well as a parent’s natural and statutory rights absent a valid court order to the contrary. Here, Petitioner  had possessory rights to his Children 
both as a matter of law (being their father with equal rights during the marriage) and under any prior court understanding. Defendants intentionally interfered with and violated Petitioner ’s possessory rights by orchestrating and enforcing a situation in 
which Petitioner  has been excluded from the Children’s lives. 
28.Morgan’s Direct Interference:  Morgan took and retained sole possession of
the Children at a time when Petitioner  was entitled to joint possession and access on 
March 6
th, 2024, Morgan acted without lawful excuse  in keeping the Children away 
from Petitioner  by locking him out of his own house. She violated the fundamental 
possessory right of Petitioner  to have access to his Children. Each day that she refused to 
produce the Children to Petitioner , she was in ongoing violation of Petitioner ’s rights . 
Nota bly, Texas law makes it a crime to knowingly violate a custody order or to keep 
children away from a legal custodian (Tex. Penal Code §  25.03), underscoring the public 
policy against such interference. Morgan’s conduct here is even more egregious because she herself engineered the void order on which she then relied.

14 29.Branthoover’s Aiding and Abetting:  Pursuant to Texas Family Code
§ 42.003, “a person who aids or assists in conduct for which a cause of action is
authorized by this chapter is jointly and severally liable”  
Branthoover aided and assisted Morgan’s interference with Petitioner ’s possessory rights 
at every step. He helped draft the false pleadings that led to Petitioner ’s removal . He had 
actual notice  that Petitioner  had rights to possession of the Children and knew that the 
intended result of the filings was to cut off those rights. Thus, Branthoover is jointly liable for the tortious interference with Petitioner ’s parental rights and custody. 
30.Elements and Malice:  Defendants’ conduct was willful and intentional.
Morgan’s objective from the moment she realized her infidelity might be exposed was to willfully deprive Petitioner  of possession of the Children to protect herself . She 
pursued multiple legal actions not to address any real danger or harm, but as “strategic maneuvers to lock in ‘temporary’ orders” ensuring Petitioner ’s removal  
Such acts were inherently malicious and without justification. Petitioner  was entitled to 
be with his Children – instead, Defendants’ actions wrongfully divested him of that entitlement . 
31.Damages (Count 1):  As a direct result of this tortious interference, Petitioner
has suffered damages in an amount within the jurisdictional limits of the Court. His damages include, but are not limited to: loss of business income for being unable to conduct his normal course of business for the last year,  loss of the value of the parent -child relationship  during the period of interference; mental anguish and 
emotional suffering  caused by being separated from his Children; expenses incurred in

15 attempting to locate, contact, and regain possession of the Children and residence which 
he depends on for work (including legal fees and investigative costs); and other economic losses such as lost business opportunities and housing costs stemming from his ouster. Texas Family Code §  42.006 specifically allows recovery of mental suffering and 
anguish  for violation of possessory rights, all of which Petitioner  has experienced. These 
losses are ongoing and increasing as the interference continues. 
32.Furthermore, Defendants acted with malice  and intent to harm Petitioner ,
warranting the imposition of exemplary (punitive) damages  under Tex. Fam. Code 
§ 42.006(b) and Chapter 41 of the Civil Practice & Remedies Code. Defendants’ conduct
was outrageous, deliberate, and undertaken with conscious disregard for Petitioner ’s 
parental rights and the Children’s wellbeing. Petitioner  seeks exemplary damages  to 
punish and deter such egregious misconduct. 
Count 2: Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress  
33.Petitioner  incorporates all prior paragraphs. Independently of (or in addition
to) the above, Defendants have committed the tort of Intentional Infliction of 
Emotional Distress (“IIED”)  against Petitioner . Under Texas law, IIED occurs when: (1) 
the defendant acted intentionally or recklessly, (2)  the conduct was extreme and 
outrageous, (3) the actions caused the Petitioner  emotional distress, and (4)  the emotional 
distress was severe. All elements are met here.  
34. Extreme and Outrageous Conduct:  Defendants’ conduct – fraudulently
fabricating allegations to strip a loving father of his children, and perpetuating that lie for over a year – is extreme and outrageous in the extreme. It “goes beyond all possible

16 bounds of decency”  and is utterly intolerable in a civilized community. Texas courts 
have recognized that behavior calculated to destroy the bond between parent and child 
can be outrageous. Morgan lied under oath repeatedly  (alleging nonexistent abuse, 
poverty, etc.), exploited the trust of the court , and effectively kidnapped the Children 
under color of law . She did so with malice aforethought, aiming to cause Petitioner  the 
maximum emotional pain – the loss of his children – as punishment for uncovering her affair . Branthoover, in turn, facilitated this scheme with knowing disregard of the harm it 
would inflict. It is hard to conceive of a more cruel and emotionally abusive act than to falsely portray a parent as dangerous and remove his children from him without cause. Defendants’ conduct offends basic societal standards of decency and has been described as a “travesty” and “alarming” even within the context of the court record . 
35.Intent or Recklessness:  Morgan’s intent to cause emotional harm to
Petitioner  (or at least reckless disregard thereof) is evident. By her own words and 
actions, her priority was to silence and punish Petitioner . When Petitioner  confronted her 
with evidence of her infidelity, she did not respond by addressing the issue honestly or seeking a fair separation – instead, she embarked on a campaign to “ensure 
Respondent’s removal” at all costs .  
36. She knew that separating Petitioner  from the Children would devastate him –
indeed, she weaponized the Children as pawns to hurt Petitioner . Even if her primary 
motive was self -interest, she certainly knew with substantial certainty  that Petitioner  
would suffer extreme distress if he lost his Children due to false accusations and suffer financial losses . Thus, she acted with at least  reckless disregard for the near certainty of

17 severe emotional harm to Petitioner . Branthoover likewise knew that helping Morgan 
perpetrate this fraud would cause Petitioner  great anguish; any reasonable person would 
recognize that outcome as the obvious consequence of these actions. Proceeding in the 
face of that knowledge is the epitome of recklessness.  
37.Severe Emotional Distress:  As a direct result of Defendants’ outrageous
actions, Petitioner  has suffered severe emotional distress . The distress is ongoing and 
has manifested in depression, anxiety, humiliation, and despair. Petitioner  has 
experienced sleeplessness, loss of appetite, and a profound sense of injustice and grief. He has been deprived of the joys of watching his children grow  – their birthdays, 
holidays, and everyday moments have been lost to him, causing an emotional void that cannot be quantified. The trauma of being falsely painted as a danger and seeing his 
children turned against him  has caused Petitioner  mental pain far beyond what any 
person should bear. This distress has substantially disrupted Petitioner ’s daily life and 
ability to function. He has required counseling/therapy to cope, and even that is insufficient to fully address the harm. The severity of Petitioner ’s emotional suffering 
meets and exceeds the standard required under Texas law (which demands a high degree of mental pain and distress that is more than mere worry, anxiety, or anger). Here, Petitioner’s entire familial world was unraveled maliciously – a truly catastrophic emotional injury.  
38.No Alternative Remedy:  Petitioner  acknowledges that IIED is a “gap -filler”
tort under Texas law, meant to supplement other causes of action when the conduct causing the emotional distress is not adequately addressed by other tort claims. To the extent any of Defendants’ conduct might be deemed outside the scope of the interference

18 tort or other claims, Petitioner  pleads IIED in the alternative. The emotional devastation 
inflicted on Petitioner  stems not only from the interference with custody (Count 1) but 
also from the cumulative effect of the lies, betrayal, and abuse of process . Should the 
court find that any aspect of Defendants’ conduct (for example, the defamatory 
implications of false abuse allegations, or the misuse of legal process) is not fully remedied by another tort, IIED should apply to ensure Petitioner  is made whole. In any 
event, Defendants’ conduct is so egregious that public policy would allow an IIED claim to proceed. 
39. Damages (Count 2):  For this Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress,
Petitioner  seeks to recover all damages allowable by law. This includes compensation 
for past and future mental anguish, emotional pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and any physical symptoms or illness resulting from the severe stress. No cap on damages applies to intentional torts of this nature, and Petitioner  will ask the trier of fact 
to award a sum that reflects the enormity of the harm (in an amount far in excess of the minimum jurisdictional limits). Petitioner  also seeks punitive damages  on the IIED 
claim, as Defendants acted willfully, maliciously, and with conscious disregard of Petitioner ’s rights. The Court should send a strong message that such outrageous abuse of 
a parent and the court system will not be tolerated. 
Count 3: Deprivation of Support and Parental Consortium (On Behalf of the 
Children)  
40.Petitioner  incorporates the preceding paragraphs. This Count is brought on
behalf of the minor Children, through Petitioner  as next friend , to recover for the 
distinct injuries the Children themselves have suffered due to Defendants’ wrongful

19 conduct. Texas law recognizes that children have a right to the “positive benefits flowing 
from parental love, affection, protection, emotional support, services, companionship, care, and society” of their parents.  
Depriving a child of a parent’s support and companionship is a grave injury to the child. 
Here, Defendants’ actions intentionally deprived the Children of the support, nurture, and companionship of their father , Petitioner . This includes both emotional support 
(parental consortium) and financial support  that Petitioner  would have provided. 
41.Intentional Deprivation:  Morgan knew that by removing Petitioner  from the
home and blocking all contact, she was also depriving the Children of their father’s presence and support . She proceeded in spite of that, placing her own interests above 
the Children’s emotional needs. Such conduct evidences a “profound disregard for her children’s needs.”  Indeed, Morgan was so consumed with maintaining her fraudulent 
narrative and pursuing extramarital relationships that she willfully ignored the harm to the Chi ldren .  
42. Branthoover, by enabling Morgan, likewise demonstrated disregard for the
impact on the Children. Defendants cannot claim ignorance – it is obvious that children suffer when a loving parent is unjustly kept from them . The Children here have 
effectively suffered the loss of a parent (albeit still living, but absent by Defendants’ design) for an extended period. This loss is analogous to, if not worse than, the loss a child experiences from a parent’s severe injury. In Texas, a child is entitled to recover for loss of parental consortium when a parent is seriously injured by a third party’s tort.

20 43. Defendants’ intentional acts inflicted a different kind of injury on Petitioner
(reputational and relational rather than physical), but the end result for the Children is 
the same : they have been bereft of their father’s daily love, guidance, and care . The 
law should not countenance a situation where a tortfeasor escapes liability simply because the harm was achieved through abuse of legal process rather than physical injury. 
44.Emotional and Developmental Harm:  As detailed, the Children have
experienced emotional turmoil, confusion, and grief from the sudden loss of Petitioner ’s 
involvement . They have been denied the comfort of his love, bedtime stories, help with 
homework, coaching at sports, and countless other forms of parental support that were 
part of their lives. This deprivation has likely caused lasting psychological harm, 
manifesting in anxiety, behavioral changes, and academic impacts. They have effectively lost the  daily affection and guidance of their father , a loss that courts have recognized 
as compensable in tort when caused by wrongdoing. Additionally, by undermining Petitioner ’s ability to provide, Defendants have also jeopardized the Children’s financial 
support. Petitioner , as the primary earner, would have used his income for the Children’s 
benefit – providing them a stable home, educational opportunities, and necessities. When Morgan ousted Petitioner  and commandeered the finances under false pretenses, the 
Children’s financial security was damaged. For example, Morgan’s misappropriation of joint funds (the $1,576 and possibly more) and her reckless handling of assets (e.g. damaging a car that Petitioner  must pay for) depleted resources that would otherwise 
have gone toward the Children’s upbringing. Furthermore, Petitioner ’s diminished 
earning capacity resulting from this ordeal (he lost access to his home office/business and

21 spent substantial time on  legal battles) di rectly tr anslates to le ss support available f or the 
Children. 
45. Further, the oldest child, M.E.M., barely surpassed the third grade without the 
guidance of her father, someone who would always assist her with school prior to his 
removal. Exhibit 8
46. Children’s C laim f or Relief: Considering the above, the Children, by and 
through P etitioner , state a cause of action for the intentional deprivation of their right to 
support and consortium of their father . This cause of action is grounded i n general tort 
principles of  intentional injury  to familial relationships, a s well as the strong publ ic 
policy of Texas to protect the parent-child bond. While Texas’s recognition of a child’s 
loss-of-parent consortium claim has typically involved cases of a parent’s phys ical injury 
or death, the rationale applies he re with ev en gr eater  force becaus e Defendants’ conduc t 
was intentional  and malicious toward the parent-child relationship itself . The Children 
were the  foreseeable and i ndeed i ntended vi ctims of  Morgan’s s chem e – she knew 
isolating  Petitioner would necessarily mean depriving the Children of their dad’s care, 
and she proceeded anywa y. Such deliberate harm to children is actionable. 
47. Damages t o the Children (Count 3): The Children s eek damages f or the loss 
of their father’s consortium, love, and affection from January 16, 2024 to present (and 
continuing) . This includes compensation for their mental anguish, emotional pain, and 
loss of  enjoyment of life during their formative years without their father . Even at their 
young ages, the Children have deeply felt the loss – crying for their father , asking why he 
is gone , and exhibiting signs of emotional trauma . These none conomic damages are 
inherently difficult to quantif y, but Texas law entrusts the jury to assign a monetary value

22 to such losses, and courts have allowed recovery for a child’s loss of a parent’s 
companionshi p and society whe n caused by a defendant’s tort.  
48. Additionall y, to the extent the Children suffered any economic harm (such as 
loss of financial support or trust funds diminished by Defendants), they seek recovery of 
those amounts as well. 
49. The Children also seek exemplary damages against Defendants for this
claim. Intentionally inflicting harm on minor children by robbing them of a parent is 
reprehensible. Morgan’s actions violated her fundamental duty as a parent to act in her 
children’s best interests, instead of using  them as l everage in he r deceit . Punitive damages 
are warranted to punish Defendants and deter others from similar conduct. 
IV. REQUEST FOR IMMEDIATE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
50. Need f or Immediate R elief: Petitioner , both individually and as Next Friend  
of the Children, hereby applies for a Temporary Restraining O rder ( “TRO”)  and 
Temporary I njunction  to immediately r estore the Children t o Petitioner ’s custody 
(or at least r esume meaningful possession/access) and prevent further irreparable harm. 
The facts de tailed abov e show  that Petitioner has a probable right t o the relief sought on 
final trial, a nd there is a probable, i mminent, an d irreparable i njury in  the interim if 
relief is not  grant ed. Money damages , while sought, are inadequate to full y compensate 
the loss of time with one’s children. Every d ay that passes i s irretrievable for  the 
Children’s upbringing an d Petitioner ’s relationship with them . No amount of money 
can restore lost childhood moments or erase the trauma of prolonged separation. Thus, 
only injunctive relief can prevent ongoing irreparable injury  by restoring the status quo.

23 51.Likelihood of Success on the Merits:  Petitioner  has made a strong prima
facie showing of his case. Defendants’ fraud and misconduct are essentially undisputed 
– Morgan has never denied the core factual allegations, and the documentary evidence(texts, bank records, court filings) overwhelmingly supports Petitioner’s claims . 
Petitioner  has already presented much of this evidence to various courts without any 
rebuttal from Morgan. In essence, Petitioner’s evidence stands unchallenged , and it 
demonstrates that the current custody arrangement was obtained by fraud and is contrary to law . Given this, Petitioner  is exceedingly likely to prevail on the merits of his tort 
claims and ultimately have the prior orders set aside.  
52.Imminent, Irreparable Harm:  The harm to be enjoined is the continued
separation of the Children from Petitioner ’s custody and care , and any further acts by 
Defendants to interfere or conceal the Children. This harm is imminent and ongoing – every moment of continued separation is harm occurring in real time. It is irreparable because once passed, time with one’s children cannot be recovered or adequately compensated. The Children are growing and changing; Petitioner  is missing milestones 
that will never  repeat. Additionally, the Children’s emotional well-being is at stake – 
prolonging the separation risks permanently damaging their relationship with Petitioner  
and their trust in their parents and the legal system. Texas courts recognize that the parent -child relationship is unique and irreplaceable , and its unjust interruption 
constitutes irreparable injury as a matter of law .  
53. If injunctive relief is denied and Defendants are later found liable, it will be
cold comfort to have a judgment for damages when the Children’s childhood has already

24 elapsed. The urgency is underscored by the fact that over a year has already been lost ; 
the Court must act now to prevent further harm. 
54. No Adequate Remedy at Law:  Petitioner  has no adequate remedy at law for
the injuries described. While Petitioner  does seek monetary damages, those alone will not 
make him or the Children whole. The law does not favor substituting dollars for parents. 
Only the return of the Children to Petitioner ’s custody/possession  and the cessation of 
Defendants’ interference can truly restore the status quo and serve the Children’s best interests. The ongoing divorce proceeding has proven inadequate to promptly address the issue – despite Petitioner ’s diligent efforts, the family court has not provided timely relief
. Thus, equita ble relief is necessary here and now.  
55.Balance of Equities and Public Interest:  The balance of equities strongly
favors Petitioner  and the Children. Granting the TRO/injunction merely restores what 
should never have been taken – a father’s presence in his kids’ lives – and aligns the situation with the truth (that Petitioner  poses no danger). Denying relief would reward 
fraud and allow an innocent family to suffer further. Defendants cannot claim any legitimate interest in continuing to enforce a fraudulent status quo. Morgan may argue she w ill be inconvenienced or upset by losing sole possession, but any such “harm” is 
self-inflicted by her misconduct and is far outweighed by the harm to the Children of 
continued separation. Moreover, it is in the public interest  to reunite the Children with 
Petitioner . Texas’s public policy  (Tex. Fam. Code § 153.001) is to ensure children have 
frequent contact with parents who act in their best interests ; – here, Petitioner  
unquestionably is such a parent, and nothing suggests otherwise. The public also has an interest in deterring litigants from abusing court processes through false claims ;

25 granting injunctive relief sends a message that the court will not a bide orders built on 
fraud.  
56. Finall y, a TRO and injunction  will promote s tability f or the Children: rather 
than the current limbo, they will have both parents available, which is presumptively 
better for them (and even for Morgan, who ca n also see the Children, as the goal is to 
ensure both parents share time). 
 57. Requested Injunctiv e Relief: Therefore, Petitioner respectfully requests that 
the Court enter a TRO immediately and, after notice and hearing, a temporary 
injunction, ordering the following relief: 
•a. Immediate Custody/Access:  Morgan Michelle Myers shall immediately
surrender the Children to Petitioner ’s custody . Petitioner  shall be restored to
possession of the Children and the marital residence at 6641 Anne Court,
Watauga, TX, forthwith. In the alternative, the Court should at least grantPetitioner  immediate and unsupervised access to the Children  on a frequent
schedule (e.g. joint or alternating custody) pending further orders. This ensuresthe Children are no longer wrongfully kept from their fat her.
•b. Enjoining Interference:  Defendants (and anyone acting in concert with them)
are restrained from interfering with Petitioner ’s custody or access  to the
Children. They shall not remove the Children from Tarrant County without Courtpermission, shall not conceal or hide the Children’s location, and shall not takeany action to prevent or hinder the contact between Petitioner  and the Children.

26 •c. Suspension of Prior Orders:  To the extent necessary, the Court should
suspend the operation of the March 14 , 2024 “Temporary Orders” or any
other orders  that currently limit Petitioner ’s access to the Children as they are
facially void ab initio. The Court has authority to do so because those orders were
obtained by fraud, lack the consent of both parties, and have never served the bestinterests of the Children. The injunction should clarify that Morgan may notenforce any prior order to exclude Petitio ner from the home or children, and that
this Court’s injunctive order supersedes any conflicting provision, and that thePetitioner’s custody and access to the residence are explicitly restored pendingtrial on the merits.
•d. Preservation of Evidence:  Defendants should be enjoined from destroying or
altering any documents, communications, or evidence relating to the matters inthis suit (including electronic evidence like text messages, emails, social mediaposts, bank records, etc.), to ensure a fair trial on the merits. (This is standard butparticularly warranted given the allegations of fraud.)
•e. Other Equitable Relief:  The Court may impose any other conditions deemed
necessary to effectuate the purposes of the injunction, such as ordering familycounseling or supervised transition if the Court finds it helpful (though Petitionermaintains he poses no risk that would necessitate supervision).
58.Petitioner  is willing to provide frequent status updates. The urgency of this matter
cannot be overstated – Petitioner  seeks a TRO ex parte due to the immediate harm and 
asks that the Court set a hearing for a temporary injunction at the earliest possible date and then a trial on the merits on an expedited schedule.

27 V.PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, P etitioner  Charles Dustin 
Myers, individually and as Next Friend of M.E.M. and C.R.M., prays that 
Defendants be cited to appear and answer, and that upon final trial, P etition er and the 
Children be granted judgment against Defendants for all relief requested above, 
including: •Actual damages  in an amount to fully compensate Petitioner  and the Children for
their injuries, including but not limited to mental anguish, loss of companionship,
lost support, and other economic and non-economic damages, all within thejurisdictional limits of the Court;
•Exemplary (punitive) damages  in an amount to punish Defendants and deter
similar conduct, as allowed by law due to Defendants’ malicious and fraudulentactions;
•Permanent Injunctive Relief  upon final judgment, to the extent needed to
ensure the Children’s ongoing relationship with Petitioner and to barDefendants from engaging in any further interference or retaliation;
•Pre- and post -judgment interest as allowed by law;
•Court costs  and reasonable attorneys’ fees  (to the extent recoverable, including
under Tex. Fam. Code § 42.006 for interference with possessory rights, whichpermits recovery of attorney’s fees and costs incurred to enforce the order andprosecute the suit ); and

28 
 • An expedited court order permitting Petitioner, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, 
and next friend of M.E.M. and C.R.M. to return to their lives and his residency. 
• All other and further relief  at law or in equity to which Petitioner  and the 
Children may show themselves justly entitled. This includes, if necessary, a declaration voiding or nullifying the prior fraudulent temporary orders, and such other declaratory relief to restore the status quo and protect the Children’s best interests. Petitioner  also asks for any appropriate sanctions against Defendants for 
their abuse of the judicial process, as may be justified by the evidence.  
Respectfully submitted,

"Health Insurance" means insurance coverage that provides basic health-care services, 
including usual physician services, office visits, hospitalization, and laboratory, X-ray, and 
emergency services, that may be provided through a health maintenance organization or other 
private or public organization, other than medical assistance under chapter 32 of the Texas 
Human Resources Code. 
"Reasonable cost" means the total cost of health insurance coverage for all children for 
which   is responsible under a medical support order that does not exceed 9 
percent of   annual resources, as described by section 154.062(b) of the 
Texas Family Code. 
"Health-care expenses" include, without limitation, medical, surgical, prescription drug, 
mental health-care services, dental, eye care, ophthalmological, and orthodontic charges but do 
not include expenses for travel to and from the provider or for nonprescription medication. 
"Health-care expenses that are not reimbursed by insurance" ("unreimbursed expenses") 
include related copayments and deductibles. 
3. Findings on Availability of Health Insurance -Having considered the cost, 
accessibility, and quality of health insurance coverage available to the parties, the Court finds: 
IT IS FURTHER FOUND that the following orders regarding health-care coverage are in 
the best interest of the children.

child support is payable for that child.   is ORDERED -
a. to provide to each conservator of the children the following information no later 
than the thirtieth day after she received Medicaid for the children: 
a.  Social Security number; 
b. Proof that health insurance has been provided for the children; 
c. The following information and documents: 
1. The name of the health insurance carrier; 
11. The number of the policy; 
111. A copy of the policy; 
1v. A schedule of benefits; 
v. A health insurance membership card; 
v1. Claim forms; and 
VII. Any other information necessary to submit a claim; and 
d. To provide each conservator of the children with a copy of any 
renewals or changes to the health insurance coverage of the children 
and any additional information regarding health insurance coverage 
of the children no later than the fifteenth day after  
 receives or is provided with the renewal, change, or 
additional information; 
e. To notify each conservator of the children of any termination or 
Copy from re:SearchTX
Copy from re:SearchTX

lapse of health insurance coverage of the children no later than the 
fifteenth day after the date of the termination or lapse; 
f. After termination or lapse of health insurance coverage, to notify 
each conservator of the children of the availability to

the fifteenth day after the date the insurance becomes available; 
g. After termination or lapse of health insurance coverage, to enroll the

coverage for the children, the insurer shall enroll the children on application of  
 or others authorized by law. 
5. Allocation ofUnreimbursed Expenses -
The conservator who incurs a health-care expense on behalf of a child is ORDERED to 
provide to the other conservator receipts, bills, statements, or explanations of benefits showing 
the uninsured portion of the health-care expenses within thirty days after the incurring 
conservator receives them. The nonincurring conservator is ORDERED to pay the non-incurring 
conservator's percentage of the unreimbursed portion of the health-care expenses either by 
paying the health-care provider directly or by reimbursing the incurring conservator for any 
advance payment exceeding the incurring conservator's percentage of the unreimbursed portion 
of the health-care expenses within thirty days after the nonincurring conservator receives 
receipts, bills, statements, or explanations of benefits showing the unreimbursed portion of the 
Copy from re:SearchTX
Copy from re:SearchTX

health-care expense. 
For the Court to hold the nonincurring conservator in civil or criminal contempt for 
failing to pay the nonincurring conservator's percentage of the unreimbursed portion of a health­
care expense, the incurring conservator must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the 
nonincurring conservator personally received receipts, bills, statements, or explanations of 
benefits reflecting the unreimbursed portion of the health-care expense no later than thirty days 
after the incurring conservator received them. Even if the incurring conservator fails to meet that 
burden of proof, the Court may award the incurring conservator a judgment in the nature of child 
support against the nonincurring conservator in the amount of the unreimbursed portion of the 
heath-care expense the nonincurring conservator was ordered but fail to pay.
