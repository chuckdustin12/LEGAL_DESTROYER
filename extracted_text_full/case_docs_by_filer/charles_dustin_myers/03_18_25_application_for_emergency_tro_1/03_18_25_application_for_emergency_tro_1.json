FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nMorgan Michelle Myers, Respondent and Danielle Kenneth Branthoover, Defendant, are \ncollectively referred to as \u201cDefendants\u201d.  \nG.Summary of the Dispute\n8. This case arises from an unprecedented and unjust separation of a father from\nhis children through fraud and deception upon the courts . On January 16, 2024, the \n322nd District Court of Tarrant County signed an order that ousted Petitioner  from his \nown home and effectively removed him from the Children\u2019s lives . To this day, that \ndrastic removal remains unexplained and unjustified, as it was procured by Defendant \nMorgan\u2019s false filings and has never been meaningfully examined. Petitioner  was given \nno real o pportunity to be heard before losing daily contact with his Children. Over a year \nhas passed, yet no court has rectified or even addressed the glaring fraud and inconsistencies  underlying the orders that separated a loving father from his kids without \ncause. \nH. Texas Policy Favors Both Parents\u2019 Involvement\n9. From the outset, it must be emphasized that Texas public policy \u201cassure[s] that\nchildren will have frequent and continuing contact with parents who have shown the \nability to act in the best interest of the child.\u201d  (Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 153.001(a)(1)) . The",

Code \u00a7 153.002). \nPetitioner  has always acted in the Children\u2019s best interests, as evidenced by his role as \ntheir primary caregiver and provider prior to court intervention. Yet Defendants\u2019 actions \nhave flipped Texas policy on its head \u2013 rather than frequent contact with both parents, the Children have been limited to one parent\u2019s custody for over a year, with the other parent (Petitioner) effectively erased from their daily lives . This lawsuit seeks to restore the \nstatus quo ante  in line with Texas law and the Children\u2019s best interests.  \nI. Background \u2013 The Marriage and Children\n10.Petitioner  and Respondent Morgan were married for eight years and are the\nparents of two minor Children (ages 6 and 8). Prior to the events in question, Petitioner  \nwas a devoted father and the primary caregiver  to the Children. He was also the \nfamily\u2019s primary breadwinner, ensuring financial stability for the household. The family lived together at their home in Watauga, Texas. The Children enjoyed a loving relationship with Petitioner , who was deeply involved in their daily routine, care, and \nupbringing. There had been no history of family violence or court intervention during the full scope of the marriage.  \nJ.Morgan\u2019s Sudden Change of Heart and Secret Preparations\n11. In early December 2023, without warning, Morgan informed Petitioner  that\nshe wanted a divorce . Her initial stated reasons were trivial (complaints about how \nPetitioner  talked to her), but soon she began condemning the entire marriage, even \nmemories she once cherished .

On or around December 12, 2023, \nPetitioner  discovered phone records showing an enormous volume of communication  \n(over 16,500 text messages) between Morgan and these individuals. Confronted with the \nlikely exposure of her infidelity and concerned about its implications, Morgan began frantically plotting to remove Petitioner  from the picture . Her goal, as evidenced by \nher actions, was to lock Petitioner  out of the marital home, isolate him from the \nChildren, and shield her own wrongdoing from scrutiny . \nK. Fraudulent and Ex Parte Court Filings (December 2023)\n12. Between December 14 and December 22, 2023, Morgan \u2013 with active help from\nDefendant Branthoover \u2013 made a series of rushed court filings  in the 322nd District \nCourt designed to obtain an upper hand through deceit . These filings were calculated to \nportray Petitioner  as an absent or dangerous spouse and to deprive him of notice or a \nchance to defend himself . In rapid succession, Morgan filed: \n\u2022a.

Exhibit 2  \n14.This statement was a knowing falsehood . In truth, Petitioner  was the primary\nfinancial provider for the family, and Morgan had access to substantial funds. In fact, just days before, on December 16, 2023, Morgan (with Branthoover\u2019s guidance) transferred $1,576.00 in joint marital funds into a new personal bank account under her control  \nusing Branthoover\u2019s PayPal as a method to obscure her banking information. Morgan admitted in text messages with Branthoover that she moved these funds, and bank records later confirmed it . Thus, at the time she swore she was penni less, she was in possession \nof significant community assets. She also grossly misrepresented her expenses in that affidavit \u2013 claiming she alone paid the mortgage/rent and car loans \u2013 when in fact Petitioner  had been paying those bills  and continued to pay them. (Notably, one of the \nvehicles Petitioner  was paying for has been repossessed by the dealer due to financial \nhardship.)

Instead, the Children have been left with the impression that their father \u201cwent away\u201d or did something wrong, which is untrue and damaging to their mental well-being.

Under Texas Family Code \u00a7 42.002, \u201ca person who takes or retains possession of a child or who conceals the whereabouts of a child in violation of a possessory right of another person may be liable for damages to that person.\u201d \n27. A \u201cpossessory right\u201d defined in the Family Code includes a court -ordered\nright of possession or access, as well as a parent\u2019s natural and statutory rights absent a valid court order to the contrary. Here, Petitioner  had possessory rights to his Children \nboth as a matter of law (being their father with equal rights during the marriage) and under any prior court understanding. Defendants intentionally interfered with and violated Petitioner \u2019s possessory rights by orchestrating and enforcing a situation in \nwhich Petitioner  has been excluded from the Children\u2019s lives. \n28.Morgan\u2019s Direct Interference:  Morgan took and retained sole possession of\nthe Children at a time when Petitioner  was entitled to joint possession and access on \nMarch 6\nth, 2024, Morgan acted without lawful excuse  in keeping the Children away \nfrom Petitioner  by locking him out of his own house. She violated the fundamental \npossessory right of Petitioner  to have access to his Children. Each day that she refused to \nproduce the Children to Petitioner , she was in ongoing violation of Petitioner \u2019s rights . \nNota bly, Texas law makes it a crime to knowingly violate a custody order or to keep \nchildren away from a legal custodian (Tex. Penal Code \u00a7  25.03), underscoring the public \npolicy against such interference. Morgan\u2019s conduct here is even more egregious because she herself engineered the void order on which she then relied.",

His damages include, but are not limited to: loss of business income for being unable to conduct his normal course of business for the last year,  loss of the value of the parent -child relationship  during the period of interference; mental anguish and \nemotional suffering  caused by being separated from his Children; expenses incurred in",

The \nlaw should not countenance a situation where a tortfeasor escapes liability simply because the harm was achieved through abuse of legal process rather than physical injury. \n44.Emotional and Developmental Harm:  As detailed, the Children have\nexperienced emotional turmoil, confusion, and grief from the sudden loss of Petitioner \u2019s \ninvolvement . They have been denied the comfort of his love, bedtime stories, help with \nhomework, coaching at sports, and countless other forms of parental support that were \npart of their lives.
