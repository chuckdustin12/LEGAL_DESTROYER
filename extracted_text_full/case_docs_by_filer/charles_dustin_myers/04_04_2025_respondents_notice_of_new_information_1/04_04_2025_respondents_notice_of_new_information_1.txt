5. The current orders, despite bearing the Associate Judge’ s signature, are void  
and of n o legal effect . 
6. The Respondent has suffered now over $110,500 in verifiable damages due to 
being unlawfully locked out of his residence on March 6, 2024. 
7. The Respondent cannot find alternative housing while being barred from being able to work. 
8. The Petitioner knows this to be true but instead sabotaged the Respondent’ s 
ability to provide for the children for the purpose of pursuing an extramarital  
relationship that began prior to the commencement of these proceedings. 
9. The Petitioner is now ENGAGED to DAMEN KAZLAUSKAS, who proposed to Petitioner in the presence of the children. 
10. There is no child support set up for the children. 
11. Petitioner continues to dispose of Respondent’s personal belongings. 
12. Desp ite her authority being in question, and despite her failure to prosecute, 
COOPER L. CARTER unilaterally inter rupted emergency proceedings on 
March 28, 2025, claiming that the case would be consolidated the following week  without being present in the courtroom. 
13. The 233
rd district court blatantly denied the Respondent due process in the 
face o f COOPER L. CARTER ’s false promise.  
14. COOPER L. CARTER doesn ’t know the law, because you cannot consolidate 
a SAPCR with a divorce matter unless the suit is transferred according to the TEXAS FAMILY CODE.  M.2021 M.2021
M.2021 M.2021 M.2021 M.2021

15. The court, at this point, is choosing to not grant relief despite having no reason 
to do so. 
16. This litigation has no possible means to an end, and it should be dismissed outright so that the SAPCR may continue. 
17. There has been no filed opposition, objection, or arguments made against the Respondent’s position in either suit.  
18. The Petitioner has wasted everyone’ s time, cau sed significant damage, and 
remains hidden in fear of being held accountable. 
19. The Petitioner prioritized an extramarital affair over prosecuting the divorce, and the children and Respondent have been signi ficantly harmed.  
Therefore, this case should be dismissed as a matter of law. Every day causes more 
irreparable harm, and this court has every abili ty an d reason to rectify this s ituation immediately.  
Respondent already has the solution and has been the only party in this matter seeking relief. It is simply unacceptable to permit this to co ntinue.
