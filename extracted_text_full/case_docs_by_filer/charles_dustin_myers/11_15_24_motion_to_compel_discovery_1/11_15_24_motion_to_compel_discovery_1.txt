RESPONDENT’S F IRST REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION & ADMISSIONS  
1. Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, asks the Court to 
compel Petitioner, MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS, through her 
attorney of record, to produce the documents requested in 
Respondent’s F irst Request for Production, Documents, and 
Admissions f iled on 9/19/24.
2. Petitioner, MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS, h as failed to 
timely object or respond to the requested admissions. Thus, 
they are deemed admitted under Texas Law. Tex.R.Civ.P. 
198.2(c); see Nguyen v. Nguyen, No. 02- 20-00070-CV, 23 
(Tex. App. Aug. 26, 2021). 
I. INTRODUCTION
3. On September 19, 2024, Respondent served Petitioner 
with his First Request for Disclosure, Production, and 
Admissions pursuant to Rule 190.3 of the Texas Rules of 
Civil Procedure. This request was made under the Level 2 
Discovery Control Plan, with the discovery period ending 
thirty days prior to the final trial date. 
4. The Respondent's First Request for Disclosure, 
Production, and Admissions requested essential information 
and documents, which Petitioner is legally obligated to

provide. A true and correct copy of this request is 
attached to this Motion as Exhibit A. 
5.Despite the statutory requirement under 198.2(a) of
the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, Petitioner has failed 
to respond or object to these requests in a timely manner. As such, Respondent now seeks an Order from this Court to compel Petitioner to comply with discovery obligations 
under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. 
II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
6.On December 15, 2023, Petitioner defrauded the
marital estate by transferring $1,576 to a third party 
without Respondent's consent the week of 
Christmas, which 
resulted in the marital account being overdrawn by $800. Respondent specifically requested Petitioner to admit or 
deny this fact in Request for Admission No. 3, which states: 
"Admit or deny that Petitioner transferred $1,576 to Daniel 
Branthoover’s PayPal account on December 15, 2023, which 
resulted in the marital bank account being overdrawn by $-
800." 
Petitioner’s failure to respond to this admission request 
within the statutory time period should result in it being

deemed admitted under Tex. R. Civ. P. 198.2(c). This 
admission is critical to Respondent's claim that Petitioner 
mishandled marital funds and defrauded the marital estate. 
7.On December 15, 2023, Petitioner allegedly
influenced her grandparents to serve an eviction notice on 
Respondent, citing a protective order and divorce petition that had not yet been filed. This is addressed in 
Request 
for Admission No. 5, which states: 
"Admit or deny that over the weekend of December 15, 2023, 
Petitioner influenced her grandparents to serve an eviction 
notice to Respondent, citing a protective order and divorce 
petition that had not yet been filed." 
Petitioner’s lack of response to this admission request 
should result in it being deemed admitted, supporting Respondent’s claim that the eviction notice was based on 
misleading or premature grounds. 
8
.On March 14, 2024, Petitioner, through her attorney,
served Respondent with temporary orders. These orders 
included Respondent’s alleged consent, as evidenced by his signature. However, Respondent disputes this alleged consent and the validity of these ord
ers, as noted in 
Request for Admission No. 13, which states:

"Admit or deny that the Respondent has abided by the 
current temporary orders in place to the best of his 
ability, and that the child support calculations, the child 
custody arrangements, and the current injunctions in place 
have no legal or factual foundation." 
By failing to respond to this admission request, Petitioner 
has effectively admitted that the temporary orders and related arrangements lack a legal or factual basis. This deemed admission supports Respondent's challenge to the 
validity of these orders.
 
9.Petitioner’s Original Petition for Divorce, filed on
December 18, 2023, allegedly contains false and misleading 
statements regarding family violence and the existence of an active protective order. Respondent addressed this 
allegation in 
Request for Admission No. 6, which states: 
"Admit or deny that on December 18, 2023, the Original 
Petition for Divorce filed by Petitioner contains false and misleading statements regarding family violence and an active order of protection." 
Petitioner’s failure to respond to this admission request 
should lead to this fact being deemed admitted, supporting Respondent's assertion that the Original Petition for 
Divorce was filed with false claims
.

10.Similarly, Petitioner’s Protective Order filed on
December 22, 2023, allegedly included additional claims of 
family violence without any active protective order in place during the marriage. This is addressed in 
Request for 
Admission No. 7, which states: 
"Admit or deny that on December 22, 2023, the Original 
Protective Order filed by Petitioner contained additional 
claims of family violence, and at the time of filing, no 
active order of protection existed, and no such order has existed throughout the marriage." 
By not responding to this request, Petitioner has 
effectively admitted that no active protective order existed during the marriage, thus supporting Respondent's 
position that the protective order contains unfounded claims. 
11.During the marriage, Petitioner directly benefited
from and was aware of Respondent's work
-from-home business 
until his removal from the residence on January 16, 2024. 
This is addressed in Request for Admission No. 10, which 
states: 
"Admit or deny that during the marriage, Petitioner 
directly benefitted from and was aware of Respondent's 
work-from-home business up until his removal on January 16, 2024."

Petitioner’s failure to respond should result in this fact 
being deemed admitted, supporting Respondent's claim that Petitioner had full knowledge of and benefited from his 
business operations during the marriage. 
III. CONCLUSION  
Each of these facts corresponds directly to a specific 
Request for Admission that Petitioner failed to respond to 
within the statutory time period. As such, Respondent 
requests that these facts be deemed admitted by the Court 
under Tex. R. Civ. P. 198.2(c), as they establish a basis 
for Respondent’s claims regarding misuse of marital assets, 
false statements in legal filings, and improper issuance of 
temporary orders. 
IV. PRAYER 
Respondent prays that the court:
 
1.Order the Petitioner, MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS , to
produce the requested documents outlined in the
first request 
for discovery, production , and
admissions
 to Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS
and deem all admissions as admitted.

2.Order any further relief the co urt deems
equitable
 and proper.
