Respondent  has exhausted all available procedural and substantive \nremedies to have his concerns addressed, and the 322nd District Court is legally \nand ethically obligated to resolve these outstanding issues \u2014especially those \ninvolving recusal, due process, and the in tegrity of prior orders \u2014before \nproceeding to a final trial. To do otherwise would violate Texas constitutional, \nstatutory, and ethical mandates requiring fairness, impartiality, and public \nconfidence in the judiciary.  \n 2. The Texas judiciary is governed by a comprehensive framework of \nconstitutional provisions, statutes, and judicial conduct codes that collectively \nimpose strict obligations on courts and judges to act fairly, honestly, and with \nintegrity. These obligations are especially pronounced in matters involving recusal, \nwhere the appearance and reality of impartiality are essential to maintaining public \ntrust in the judicial system.  \n 3. When a party files a recusal motion \u2014including a tertiary recusal \u2014Texas \nlaw prescribes specific procedures to ensure that the motion is handled impartially \nand efficiently, and that the judge\u2019s conduct does not undermine the integrity of the \nprocess.

Constitutional and Statutory Framework  \n 3. Texas law imposes strict constitutional, statutory, and ethical duties on \ncourts and judges to ensure that all proceedings, especially those involving recusal \nand allegations of bias, are handled with the utmost fairness, integrity, and \ntransparency. Respondent  has repeatedly invoked these protections, filing verified \nmotions, objections, and requests for hearings, and has documented procedural \nirregularities, unaddressed motions, and violations of due process and the Texas \nFamily Code; the court\u2019s failure to address these matters before moving to final \ntrial would undermine the legitimacy of the judicial process and erode public trust.  \n 4. Texas courts are vested with inherent powers to control proceedings, \nensure justice is done, and require that all proceedings are conducted with dignity \nand order . See Tex. Gov't. Code \u00a7 21.001 . Judges are statutorily required to \ndiligently discharge their administrative responsibilities, rule on cases within \nspecified timeframes, and, crucially, follow established procedures for recusal and \ndisqualification to address any potential bias or conf lict of interest .

The 322nd District Court must resolve all pending recusal motions, \nprocedural objections, and due process concerns before setting the case for final \ntrial, as required by the Texas Constitution, Government Code, Family Code, and \nbinding Texas Supreme Court  precedent. Proceeding to trial without first \naddressing these threshold issues would not only contravene established law but \nalso risk disciplinary consequences for the court and  continuous  irreparable harm \nto the children , especially where the record reflects a pattern of unaddressed bias, \nprocedural irregularities, and violations of fundamental rights.  \nB. Recusal and Disqualification Procedures  \n 6. Texas law provides a detailed framework for recusal and disqualification. \nWhen a motion for recusal is filed, the judge must either recuse themselves or refer \nthe motion to the presiding judge for assignment to another judge ( Tex. Gov't. \nCode \u00a7 29.055 ). For tertiary recusal motions (the third or subsequent recusal \nmotion by the same party), the judge must continue to preside over the case and \nmove it toward final disposition unless and until the motion is sustained ( Tex. \nGov't. Code \u00a7 25.00256 ). However, the judge must still comply with all applicable \nprocedural rules for recusal and disqualification, and the process must be handled \nin a manner that is transparent, impartial, and consistent with due process ( Tex. \nGov't. Code \u00a7 25.00255 ).",

The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, specifically Rule 18a, require that a \nmotion to recuse be verified, state with particularity the grounds for recusal, and be \nserved on all parties. Once a sufficient motion is filed, the judge must either recuse \nthemselv es or request the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district to \nassign another judge to hear the motion. If a recusal motion is timely and facially \nsufficient, a hearing is mandator y. \nC. Due Process and Family Law Protections  \n 8. Due process under the United States and Texas Constitutions requires that \nno person be deprived of life, liberty, or property without notice and an opportunity \nto be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner . See In re V .K ., 607 \nS.W.3d 471 (Tex. App. 2020) ). In family law, the natural right between parents and \nchildren is of constitutional dimension, and courts must strictly adhere to statutory \nrequirements before issuing orders that affect these rights ( Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 \n83.006 ). \nD. Judicial Conduct and Ethical Standards  \n 9. Judges  are required to act at all times in a manner that promotes public \nconfidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.

The Court\u2019s Legal and Ethical Obligations  \n 12. The 322nd District Court is bound by constitutional, statutory, and \nethical mandates to address all pending recusal motions, procedural objections, and \ndue process concerns before proceeding to a final trial. The Texas Constitution and \nGovernment Code requ ire judges to act with integrity, avoid bias, and ensure that \nall proceedings are conducted fairly and in accordance with the law ( Tex. Const. \nart. 5 \u00a7 1 -a; Tex. Gov't. Code \u00a7 74.059 ). \n 13. When a recusal motion is filed, the judge must either recuse themselves \nor refer the motion to the presiding judge for assignment to another judge ( Tex. \nGov't. Code \u00a7 29.055 ). The judge may not take further action in the case until the \nrecusal motion is resolved, except for good cause stated in the order. For tertiary \nrecusal motions, the judge must continue to preside over the case, but this does not \nrelieve the court of its  duty to ensure that the recusal process is handled impartially \nand in strict compliance with procedural rules ( Tex. Gov't. Code \u00a7 25.00256 ). \n 14. Failure to follow these procedures undermines the integrity of the \njudicial process and can result in disciplinary action, removal from office, or",

Therefore, if this Court chooses to not act sua sponte within a reasonable \ntime, when the recusal motion follows \u2013 the involvement of the court coordinator \nshould  be prohibi ted, as her involvement in the prior two recusal proceedings lead \nto questionable ac tions, delay, and created  conflict s of interest . The recusal \nprocedure is designed to ensure public confidence in the judiciary , and her \ncontinued involvement has proven to have the opposite effect . \nG. The Importance of Addressing Threshold Issues Before Final Trial  \n 16. Proceeding to a final trial without first addressing the la ck of \nparticipation by the opposing side , the current \u2018agreed orders \u2019 that bear one side \u2019s \nsignature,  due process violations, and procedural objections would violate the \nfundamental principles of fairness and impartiality that underpin the Texas judicial \nsystem. The Texas Supreme Court has made clear that even the appearance of \nimpropriety or bias is suff icient to require recusal, as public confidence in the \njudiciary is paramount . See Sun Exploration and Production Co. v. Jackson , 783 \nS.W.2d 202 (Tex. 1989) ; See also Sears v. Nueces County Sherriff Olivarez , 28 \nS.W.3d 611 (Tex. App. 2000) ).",

Moreover, Texas law provides that an interlocutory appeal from certain \norders, such as those granting or refusing a temporary injunction, stays the \ncommencement of a trial in the trial court pending resolution of the appeal ( Tex. \nCiv. Prac. and Rem. Code \u00a7 51.014 ). This underscores the principle that threshold \nissues must be resolved before a case can proceed to final disposition.  \nH. The Consequences of Judicial Inaction  \n 18. The record reflects a pattern of judicial inaction, procedural \nirregularities, and potential bias that, if left unaddressed, would not only harm the \nparties but also erode public confidence in the judiciary. The Texas Supreme Court \nhas held that judicial d ecisions rendered under circumstances that suggest bias, \nprejudice, or favoritism undermine the integrity of the courts and thwart the \nprinciples on which the judicial system is based . See Sun Exploration and \nProduction Co. v. Jackson , 783 S.W.2d 202 (Tex. 1989) ). \n 19. In this case, the court\u2019s failure to address dispositive motions, recusal \nproceedings in accordance with the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure , and due \nprocess violations \u2014despite repeated and documented efforts by the R espondent \u2014\nraises serious questions about the impartiality and integrity of the proceedings. The \ncourt\u2019s obligation is not merely to move cases to final trial, but to ensure that \njustice is done in an orderly, fair, and transparent manner ( Tex. Gov't. Code \u00a7",

Conclusion  \n 20. The Respondent, Charles Myers has done everything the law requires \u2014\nand more \u2014to have his concerns addressed by the 322nd District Court.
