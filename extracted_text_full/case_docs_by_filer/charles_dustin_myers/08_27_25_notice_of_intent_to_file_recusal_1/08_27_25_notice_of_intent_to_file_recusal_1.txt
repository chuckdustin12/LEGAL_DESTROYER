TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THIS  COURT:  
 Respondent, Charles Dustin My ers, respectfully submits this notice 
regarding the intent to file a tertiary  recusal . The Respondent hereby puts the 
reviewing staff mem bers, the opposing party , the H onorable Judge of this Court, 
and the Regional Presiding Judge on notice to bring attention to the critical and 
compounding issues that co ntinue to accrue within this matter.  
 The court and all officials involved  are statutorily and ethically obligated to 
ensure that the motion , when filed, is handled in strict compliance with the law and 
with the highest standards of fairness and integrity. The judge must continue to 
preside over the case unless and until the motion is sustained, but must also ensure 
that the process is transparent, impartia l, and free from any appearance of 
impropriety . See Tex. Gov't. Code § 25.00256 ).

 I. Summary  
 1. Respondent  has exhausted all available procedural and substantive 
remedies to have his concerns addressed, and the 322nd District Court is legally 
and ethically obligated to resolve these outstanding issues —especially those 
involving recusal, due process, and the in tegrity of prior orders —before 
proceeding to a final trial. To do otherwise would violate Texas constitutional, 
statutory, and ethical mandates requiring fairness, impartiality, and public 
confidence in the judiciary.  
 2. The Texas judiciary is governed by a comprehensive framework of 
constitutional provisions, statutes, and judicial conduct codes that collectively 
impose strict obligations on courts and judges to act fairly, honestly, and with 
integrity. These obligations are especially pronounced in matters involving recusal, 
where the appearance and reality of impartiality are essential to maintaining public 
trust in the judicial system.  
 3. When a party files a recusal motion —including a tertiary recusal —Texas 
law prescribes specific procedures to ensure that the motion is handled impartially 
and efficiently, and that the judge’s conduct does not undermine the integrity of the 
process. Judges  must avoid actual bias and even the appearance of impropriety and

3 
 must comply with both the letter and spirit of the law to uphold the legitimacy of 
the courts.  
II. Background and Relevant Law  
A. Constitutional and Statutory Framework  
 3. Texas law imposes strict constitutional, statutory, and ethical duties on 
courts and judges to ensure that all proceedings, especially those involving recusal 
and allegations of bias, are handled with the utmost fairness, integrity, and 
transparency. Respondent  has repeatedly invoked these protections, filing verified 
motions, objections, and requests for hearings, and has documented procedural 
irregularities, unaddressed motions, and violations of due process and the Texas 
Family Code; the court’s failure to address these matters before moving to final 
trial would undermine the legitimacy of the judicial process and erode public trust.  
 4. Texas courts are vested with inherent powers to control proceedings, 
ensure justice is done, and require that all proceedings are conducted with dignity 
and order . See Tex. Gov't. Code § 21.001 . Judges are statutorily required to 
diligently discharge their administrative responsibilities, rule on cases within 
specified timeframes, and, crucially, follow established procedures for recusal and 
disqualification to address any potential bias or conf lict of interest . See Tex. Gov't. 
Code § 74.059 .

4 
  5. The 322nd District Court must resolve all pending recusal motions, 
procedural objections, and due process concerns before setting the case for final 
trial, as required by the Texas Constitution, Government Code, Family Code, and 
binding Texas Supreme Court  precedent. Proceeding to trial without first 
addressing these threshold issues would not only contravene established law but 
also risk disciplinary consequences for the court and  continuous  irreparable harm 
to the children , especially where the record reflects a pattern of unaddressed bias, 
procedural irregularities, and violations of fundamental rights.  
B. Recusal and Disqualification Procedures  
 6. Texas law provides a detailed framework for recusal and disqualification. 
When a motion for recusal is filed, the judge must either recuse themselves or refer 
the motion to the presiding judge for assignment to another judge ( Tex. Gov't. 
Code § 29.055 ). For tertiary recusal motions (the third or subsequent recusal 
motion by the same party), the judge must continue to preside over the case and 
move it toward final disposition unless and until the motion is sustained ( Tex. 
Gov't. Code § 25.00256 ). However, the judge must still comply with all applicable 
procedural rules for recusal and disqualification, and the process must be handled 
in a manner that is transparent, impartial, and consistent with due process ( Tex. 
Gov't. Code § 25.00255 ).

5 
  7. The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, specifically Rule 18a, require that a 
motion to recuse be verified, state with particularity the grounds for recusal, and be 
served on all parties. Once a sufficient motion is filed, the judge must either recuse 
themselv es or request the presiding judge of the administrative judicial district to 
assign another judge to hear the motion. If a recusal motion is timely and facially 
sufficient, a hearing is mandator y. 
C. Due Process and Family Law Protections  
 8. Due process under the United States and Texas Constitutions requires that 
no person be deprived of life, liberty, or property without notice and an opportunity 
to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner . See In re V .K ., 607 
S.W.3d 471 (Tex. App. 2020) ). In family law, the natural right between parents and 
children is of constitutional dimension, and courts must strictly adhere to statutory 
requirements before issuing orders that affect these rights ( Tex. Fam. Code § 
83.006 ). 
D. Judicial Conduct and Ethical Standards  
 9. Judges  are required to act at all times in a manner that promotes public 
confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. They must avoid both 
actual bias and the appearance of bias, and recuse themselves when their

6 
 impartiality might reasonably be questioned . See Sears v. Nueces County Sherriff 
Olivarez , 28 S.W.3d 611 (Tex. App. 2000) .  
 10. In the present case, these requirements have fallen short in every aspect, 
as several outstanding issues remain ignored despite the court being fully aware of 
the issues.  
III. Analysis  
E. Respondent ’s Exhaustion of Remedies  
 11. The record demonstrates that Charles Myers has taken every reasonable 
and available step to have his concerns addressed by the 322nd District Court. He 
has: 
 i.  Filed verified motions to recuse, stating with particularity the  
  grounds for recusal as required by Rule 18a;  
 ii.  Objected to procedural irregularities, including the improper  
  involvement of the court coordinator in recusal matters, which  
  is not  authorized by the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure;  
 iii.  Sought hearings on his motions, as mandated by law;  
iv. Filed objections to orders and assignments that 
mischaracterized the operative pleadings or included judges not 
named in the recusal motion;

7 
 v. Documented the failure of the court to address dispositive 
motions, including motions for summary judgment, motions to 
compel, and motions to dismiss for want of prosecution;  
vi. Raised due process violations, including the lack of notice, 
opportunity to be heard, and the absence of required findings 
before being excluded from his home or deprived of parental 
rights;  
vii. Pursued appellate remedies, including petitions for writ of 
mandamus and appeals to the Texas Supreme Court, all of 
which were denied or remain unresolved;  
viii. Provided notice to all parties and the court of ongoing harm to 
his children, including medical emergencies, and the failure of 
the court to act on these urgent matters.  
ix. Has opened co ncurrent  litigation in the Western District of 
Oklahoma to address the Petitioner ’s illegal acts leading up to 
the divorce suit.  
x. Has provided the opposing counsel with evidence that remains 
unopposed regarding false claims of violence, in digency, and 
received no response.

8 
 These actions satisfy, and indeed exceed, the procedural and substantive 
requirements imposed by Texas law for a party seeking judicial relief and 
accountability.  
F. The Court’s Legal and Ethical Obligations  
 12. The 322nd District Court is bound by constitutional, statutory, and 
ethical mandates to address all pending recusal motions, procedural objections, and 
due process concerns before proceeding to a final trial. The Texas Constitution and 
Government Code requ ire judges to act with integrity, avoid bias, and ensure that 
all proceedings are conducted fairly and in accordance with the law ( Tex. Const. 
art. 5 § 1 -a; Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.059 ). 
 13. When a recusal motion is filed, the judge must either recuse themselves 
or refer the motion to the presiding judge for assignment to another judge ( Tex. 
Gov't. Code § 29.055 ). The judge may not take further action in the case until the 
recusal motion is resolved, except for good cause stated in the order. For tertiary 
recusal motions, the judge must continue to preside over the case, but this does not 
relieve the court of its  duty to ensure that the recusal process is handled impartially 
and in strict compliance with procedural rules ( Tex. Gov't. Code § 25.00256 ). 
 14. Failure to follow these procedures undermines the integrity of the 
judicial process and can result in disciplinary action, removal from office, or

9 
 reversal of judicial decisions ( Tex. Const. art. 5 § 1 -a; Sun Exploration and 
Production Co. v. Jackson , 783 S.W.2d 202 (Tex. 1989) ). 
 15. Therefore, if this Court chooses to not act sua sponte within a reasonable 
time, when the recusal motion follows – the involvement of the court coordinator 
should  be prohibi ted, as her involvement in the prior two recusal proceedings lead 
to questionable ac tions, delay, and created  conflict s of interest . The recusal 
procedure is designed to ensure public confidence in the judiciary , and her 
continued involvement has proven to have the opposite effect . 
G. The Importance of Addressing Threshold Issues Before Final Trial  
 16. Proceeding to a final trial without first addressing the la ck of 
participation by the opposing side , the current ‘agreed orders ’ that bear one side ’s 
signature,  due process violations, and procedural objections would violate the 
fundamental principles of fairness and impartiality that underpin the Texas judicial 
system. The Texas Supreme Court has made clear that even the appearance of 
impropriety or bias is suff icient to require recusal, as public confidence in the 
judiciary is paramount . See Sun Exploration and Production Co. v. Jackson , 783 
S.W.2d 202 (Tex. 1989) ; See also Sears v. Nueces County Sherriff Olivarez , 28 
S.W.3d 611 (Tex. App. 2000) ).

10 
  17. Moreover, Texas law provides that an interlocutory appeal from certain 
orders, such as those granting or refusing a temporary injunction, stays the 
commencement of a trial in the trial court pending resolution of the appeal ( Tex. 
Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code § 51.014 ). This underscores the principle that threshold 
issues must be resolved before a case can proceed to final disposition.  
H. The Consequences of Judicial Inaction  
 18. The record reflects a pattern of judicial inaction, procedural 
irregularities, and potential bias that, if left unaddressed, would not only harm the 
parties but also erode public confidence in the judiciary. The Texas Supreme Court 
has held that judicial d ecisions rendered under circumstances that suggest bias, 
prejudice, or favoritism undermine the integrity of the courts and thwart the 
principles on which the judicial system is based . See Sun Exploration and 
Production Co. v. Jackson , 783 S.W.2d 202 (Tex. 1989) ). 
 19. In this case, the court’s failure to address dispositive motions, recusal 
proceedings in accordance with the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure , and due 
process violations —despite repeated and documented efforts by the R espondent —
raises serious questions about the impartiality and integrity of the proceedings. The 
court’s obligation is not merely to move cases to final trial, but to ensure that 
justice is done in an orderly, fair, and transparent manner ( Tex. Gov't. Code §

11 
 21.001 ). Here, this Court has permitted a non -prosecuting attorney to exist merely 
to block relief , not participate in the issues, and not  comply with discovery 
requests , while allowing her client, Morgan Michelle Myers, to escape 
accountability for the decepti ve pleadings and harm caused to the children.  
IV. Conclusion  
 20. The Respondent, Charles Myers has done everything the law requires —
and more —to have his concerns addressed by the 322nd District Court. The court 
is legally and ethically obligated to resolve all outstanding dispositive motions, 
procedural objections, and due process concerns before proceeding to a final trial. 
To do otherwise would violate the Texas Constitution, Government Code, Family 
Code, and binding Texas Supreme Court precedent, and would undermine the 
integrity of the judi cial process and public confidence in the judiciary. The court 
must act now to restore fairness, impartiality, and justice to these proceedings . 
 21. Shall the court not provide an explanation for the conduct alleged herein, 
or at least sua sponte set a hearing on these issues, Respondent will initiate recusal 
proceedings, will  pursue further Mandamus relief , and will pursue Federal 
Injunctive Relief for all involved parties in their individual capacities who have  
acted ultra -vires and p layed a part in the willful deprivation of constitutionally

12 
 protected ri ghts, and will seek media attention to shed light on this unprecedented  
situation.  
 22. There is a national c risis regarding parental rights, an d it’s ramping up 
fast. Individuals such as Jeff Younger, Jeff Morgan, Jessica Saxton, Texas for 
Judicial Accountability, Robert Garza, and many others  – many of whom the 
Respondent is in close connection with – are pushing for change .  
 23. The startling numbers from the 8th Administrat ive Region highlight s an 
ongoing systemic issue regarding the public confidence in the judiciary. This court 
is now provided with another opportunity to help restore that confidence .
