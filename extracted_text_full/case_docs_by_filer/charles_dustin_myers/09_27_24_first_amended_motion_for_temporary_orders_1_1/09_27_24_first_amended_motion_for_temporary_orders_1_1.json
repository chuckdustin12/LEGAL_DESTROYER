Given the evolving facts and the clear \nforesight demonstrated in these earlier submissions, Respondent respectfully \nurges the court to revisit these filings in the interest of ensuring a just resolution.

The P\netitioner appeared before this Court on December 14, 2023,\nrequesting an ex-p arte temporary order of protection, and subsequently filed a \nprotective order on December 22, 2023. The Respondent contends that the \nP\netitioner's narrative is an attempt to avoid accountability for her extramarital \naffairs\n which was discovered just prior to the initiation of her pleadings. \nii.While the Petitioner engaged in activities outside the marriage, the\nRespondent remained at home caring for the children. During the time the \nPetitioner pursued legal actions shortly before Christmas, the Respondent was \npreparing for the children's holiday. Since taking residence in the family home, \nt\nhe Petitioner has reportedly moved in her sister, reduced her employment to \nt\nhree hours per day, failed to complete the court-o rdered parenting course, and is \nnot contributing rent to her grandmother. The Respondent asserts that there is \nsufficient evidence on record to substantiate these claims, and predicted this exact \noutcome\n within his first pleadings within the clerk\u2019s record, attached hereto. \niii.The Respondent believes that this case has been conducted in the best\ninterest of the Petitioner rather than the children, a concern that has been \nrepeatedly\n raised without response. The current orders in place are lack lawful \nfoundation,\n and there has been minimal meaningful engagement from the \nPetitioner's attorney.
