NO. 322- 744263- 23 
IN THE 322ND DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS  
FOREWORD  
On January 16th, 2024, amid inclement weather, the Respondent was 
ordered to vacate the residency at a show cause hearing for an order of protection 
where a continuance was granted, and cause number 322-744263-2 3 was 
consolidated with cause number 322-744538- 23 on the court’s own motion, and 
the case was reset to January 22nd, 2024, and then again for February 1st, 2024, 
where a settlement agreement was quickly drafted and Respondent was advised 
to sign it by his former counsel.  
This led to the subsequent termination of counsel, leaving Respondent to 
request an emergency hearing to vacate the associate judge’s report for temporary 
orders, which was the only hearing to date in this case after eight months.  
The unusual circumstances surrounding the initiation of this case warrant 
the court's reconsideration of the Respondent's original answer and subsequent 
briefs1 filed before the initial setting. Given the evolving facts and the clear 
foresight demonstrated in these earlier submissions, Respondent respectfully 
urges the court to revisit these filings in the interest of ensuring a just resolution.   IN THE MATTER OF THE

AFFIDAVIT, VERIFIED PLEADING, AND BOND NOT REQUIRED
D. Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS requests the court issue
the above orders without n otice a nd hearing a nd in the a bsence of a 
verified pleading, affidavit, and dispense with the necessity of a bond on 
behalf of the parties, their children, and the protection of their property in 
connection
 with these orders p ursuant to the Texas Family Code, section 
6.503 w ithout notice and hearing.

6 4. Extra ordinary relief
E. Given the extraordinary circumstances of this case, Respondent,
CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, requests that the court order his return to the 
residency , where he will resume rent payments and begin transitioning and recovering from the ongoing deprivation that has lasted throughout the 
case. The Respondent has attached a proposed parenting plan which was 
overlooked on January 16
th, 2024, when this court decided to order him to 
vacate the residency which he requires to financially support the Children 
during the pendency of the case.  
F . Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS further requests that the
court vacate the orders currently in place sua sponte replacing them with 
the current orders, which will allow him to withdraw his Motion for Rehearing in the Supreme Court of Texas. Cause no. 24 -0395.  
G. The Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS prays the Court will
take swift action and intends to demonstrate through his actions how these orders suit the best interests of the children in this case.  
H. The Respondent respectfully requests expedited action on this
motion by October 1
st, 2024, as he will be forced to temporarily relocate to 
Denton, Texas pending relief, which will further exacerbate the situation and will further separate him from his children.

7 CONCLUSION 
i. The P
etitioner appeared before this Court on December 14, 2023,
requesting an ex-p arte temporary order of protection, and subsequently filed a 
protective order on December 22, 2023. The Respondent contends that the 
P
etitioner's narrative is an attempt to avoid accountability for her extramarital 
affairs
 which was discovered just prior to the initiation of her pleadings. 
ii.While the Petitioner engaged in activities outside the marriage, the
Respondent remained at home caring for the children. During the time the 
Petitioner pursued legal actions shortly before Christmas, the Respondent was 
preparing for the children's holiday. Since taking residence in the family home, 
t
he Petitioner has reportedly moved in her sister, reduced her employment to 
t
hree hours per day, failed to complete the court-o rdered parenting course, and is 
not contributing rent to her grandmother. The Respondent asserts that there is 
sufficient evidence on record to substantiate these claims, and predicted this exact 
outcome
 within his first pleadings within the clerk’s record, attached hereto. 
iii.The Respondent believes that this case has been conducted in the best
interest of the Petitioner rather than the children, a concern that has been 
repeatedly
 raised without response. The current orders in place are lack lawful 
foundation,
 and there has been minimal meaningful engagement from the 
Petitioner's attorney. The Respondent is concerned about the ongoing financial

8 erosion a ffecting t he children's w ell-being a nd sees n o logical basis t o consider t he 
existing arrangements as serving their best interests. 
iv.Granting
 this motion would initiate a long-o verdue healing process. The
Petitioner s hould be r equired t o explain h er actions a nd be h eld a ccountable. T he 
Respondent e mphasizes t he cr itical n eed f or access t o the r esidence t o provide f or 
the children w hile seeking a lternative accommodations n ea rb y. This n eed is 
argued to t ake precedence over t he Petitioner's d esire to p rotect h erself f rom the 
consequences of her own actions. 
v.The Respondent respectfully urges the Court to intervene and m ake a
decision that genuinely serves the best interests of the children. 
vi.If anything else – the orders currently in place show the truth. Mother
can’t
 pay rent, hasn’t completed her responsibilities for the Children, and has 
reduced h er employment. Father has followed all aspects of the orders that he is 
able to given the circumstances.  
vii.So long as the Children are in Father’s care and he is given a fair
amount of time to transition from the residency to ensure that he may still provide 
for his Children financially while the case is pending, the status quo will be 
maintained. 
viii. Father has overwhelming evidence to support all claims herein, already
served to Petitioner, and without response, and already on the record. 
Respondent prays that this Court will consider the totality of the case, and grant 
this motion to rightfully restore the status quo.

9 PRAYER FOR EXPEDITED RELIEF  
Respondent  requests the following expedited relief:  
1. Vacate the current orders, which were entered in violation of
the Respondent's right to due process and a fair hearing. These 
orders were rendered as "agreed" without the Respondent's 
consent and are unsupported by any motion that was properly served on him. 
2. Grant the Respondent's motion for temporary orders without
notice or hearing to the Petitioner, restoring the status quo for the children and enabling the Respondent to meet his financial obligations  related to the Children  and allow healing to begin.  
3. Provide a provision allowing the Respondent to return to the
residence at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, TX 76148 where he was 
wrongfully removed  including the option for Petitioner to reside 
there as well if she so chooses.  
4.Strike all pleadings from the Respondent other than the Rule 12
motion to show authority and the summary judgement motion in
the interest of judicial economy .
5. Grant any further relief that this Court finds equitable, just,
and appropriate  so that we may finally get this case headed 
in the right direction and in alignment with the Children’s 
best interest.
