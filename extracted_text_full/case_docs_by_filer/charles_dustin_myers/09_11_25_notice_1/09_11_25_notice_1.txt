TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THIS COURT:  
 COMES NOW  Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS , and provides this notice to 
place on the record that significant issues which have persisted throughout this case are now 
being addressed by opposing counsel, Cooper L. Carter . These actions appear calculated to 
quietly remedy the problems without directly confronting or acknowledging the issues as pled.  
 1. Specifically, the following issues which Ms. Carter has not addressed after over a year 
of non-responsiveness include:  
i. On September 20, 2024, Cooper L. Carter was served with a Rule 12 Motion to Show Authority on the grounds of ambiguity surrounding her employment. REC. 1169. 
Further grounds included her lack of participation throughout this case, and an individual named Roderick D. Marx filing pleadings on her behalf.  
ii. On February 20, 2025, Respondent filed a Motion to Sign, and served it on opposing counsel, showing in an exhibit that her EFM (Electronic Filing Manager) was still

2 registered to her prior employer (Cantey Hangar) with the date showing March 13, 
2025 in the screenshot. REC. 1654. 
iii.In several pleadings, Respondent also notified the Court and Ms. Carter that herpublic LinkedIn profile also showed that she was no longer employed at Marx Altmanand Johnson. REC. 1172, REC. 1434, REC. 2293, REC. 2563, REC. 3040, REC.
3051, REC. 3121,  REC. 3307, REC. 3318, REC. 3751.
iv. Ms. Carter has provided no explanation for these discrepancies, no explanation for
her lack of participation, and has shown an inability to conduct herself ethically andto the standards set forth in the Texas Lawyer’s Creed.
2. Now, as of September 11, 2025, Ms. Carter is going back through and fixing these errorswithout addressing the issues. Exhibit 1. 3. These changes come directly following an email exchange sent to the Court Coordinator.Exhibit 2. 4. Furthermore, on September 8, 2025, a letter was mailed to the Respondent’s residence at 6641Anne Court, Watauga, Texas, 76148, sent from “Marx Altman and Johnson” with the name “Victoria Weaver” on the envelope. Exhibit 3. 
5. Victoria weaver is not a party to this suit, holds a managerial role at Marx, Altman, andJohnson, and Cooper L. Carter claimed to have been retained in her individual capacity, and stated the same two times on the record. REC. 217, REC. 2280. 
6. These actions are being documented on the record to highlight how the opposing sidecontinues to operate outside the bounds of ethical standards, and Cooper L. Carter is put on notice not to destroy, conceal, alter, or dispose of the letter mailed on Sep tember 8, 2025, as no 
attorney -client relationship exists between Morgan Michelle Myers and Victoria Weaver.

Ms. Baker,
Just so I understand, I need the following to be explained, and anyone CC'ed in this email is free to provide input.
Regarding the recusal procedures (this marks the third):
The first recusal, you send me a modified version of my pleading as if I'm not going to notice it's missing the exhibits and
affidavit critical to the motion. You confirm it was electronically filed when I bring this discrepancy up, and then suddenly
change your answer when I bring up the file size discrepancy, and modify it again in conjunction with an amended order of
referral but that time split the file into three parts because of the "size of the motion" which directly contradicts how the
filing procedure works, as per the T arrant County District Clerk's FAQ.The parties agreed to continue the case because I had a dental emergency the day of the first hearing on November  7th,
which everyone agreed to in writing, and which I appreciated. That was denied for a failure to appear.
Because I read the Regional Judge's order, I waited for the next four months while the other side did absolutely nothing
and reached out to you about an unopposed summary judgement that's been on the docket since February 22, 2024. You9/11/25, 11:06 AM Gmail - FW: Myers 322-744263-23
https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ik=13839461f7&view =pt&search=all&permthid=thread-f:1842822989587015946&simpl=msg-f:1842822989587015… 2/5

told me to file a notice of hearing, which I already had when I filed the original motion, and reminded you that the judges
hadn't been reinstated back into the case.
Then, the next two recusals, you didn't attach any motion at all to the orders of referral, and erroneously included an order
of referral for Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer not once, but now twice, when he wasn't implicated in either of the second or third
motions.
All three times I have no indication that the correct pleading was even sent to the Regional Presiding Judge, as the orders
don't comport with what was filed, and we have judges electing not to recuse who were never asked to, and then orders
denying motions which were never filed follow.
The inconsistency surrounding a straightforward process set forth in the rules of procedure is being
unnecessarily  obfuscated, and there doesn't exist a logical explanation that warrants confusing a process designed to
promote judicial fairness, transparency, and impartiality.
As a final reminder, and in good faith to prevent any further disruption to the rule of law, these issues must be addressed
or explained:
1. The most recent recusal brings up serious issues that undermine the judiciary, as I'm concurrently litigating in the
Western District of Oklahoma trying to seek damages from this situation pursuant to RICO, and I warned the court that
because I have no alternative options, and the Court insists on moving to final trial in the midst of all of these issues, I
must enjoin additional defendants as the court found I was lacking continuity and relatedness.
2. The actions taken here provide the missing elements of the RICO claim according to the 10th Circuit, however, I will be
appealing to the 10th circuit given there is a circuit split of authority regarding this aspect of RICO law.
3. I've given this Court many chances to provide corrective action, I've tried to warn the court that there's an ongoing
criminal enterprise that was formed in December of 2023, yet it continues to ignore these unrebutted facts, and has now
clearly chosen to become part of the enterprise I have repeatedly brought to the court's attention through several different
vehicles, including mandamus petitions.
4. We can't even follow recusal procedures correctly, and for some reason you continue to be involved when nowhere in
the T exas Rules of Civil Procedure does it give you any designated role in this process.6. You feel the need to email me these exchanges, when they should just be filed with the EFM. Nobody in this case
requires emailed service, because the attorney on the other side is registered under the EFM, albeit  to her prior employer,
which is another issue the Court continues to ignore. Electronic filing is REQUIRED, it's not optional for licensed
attorneys.
7. I've filed six mandamus and have received zero responses from any implicated judge, and all the Court has to base its
reasoning on is an order that claims consent with only one side of the case's signature on it.
The only argument I've been given is that your position is to "help effectuate and expedite justice", yet here - no logical
person knowing these facts would think for a second that the Court is being impartial, or that your involvement has done
anything other than create ambiguities in a process designed to show the Court is, in fact, unbiased and fair.
Again, I understand the bias is there - but you have to put yourself in my shoes, even if just for a moment, and realize that
this entire time all I've done is try to WARN the court with facts that - to this day - remain unopposed within a record that
exceeds 3,900 pages and exists in the public domain.

cossup&DT=RECORD&MediaID= 804ac8d3-9b5f-40b0-bc41- bbc08c814365
I don't want to litigate. I don't want to continue to try and explain what's already obvious. I want to get justice for my
children, which is why instead of performing self-help remedies, I've tried to follow the law and give the court every
opportunity that I possibly could to make them aware that it is actively assisting a criminal RICO enterprise in furthering
their scheme, providing the continuity and relatedness elements that the Western District of Oklahoma found was
lacking, and that will be appealed to the 10th circuit.
I didn't ask to be in this position, I was put here, and I have no other options but to initiate a federal action and use the
3,900 page record and the unexplained misconduct as self-authenticating evidence that what I've been saying is the truth.9/11/25, 11:06 AM Gmail - FW: Myers 322-744263-23

This is nothing against you personally, Ms. Baker, I understand politics are at play here with next year's elections coming
up - but this is my life - it has been destroyed, and I have to do everything that the law allows to ensure that this situation
is remedied.In fact, I take nothing that has occurred personally, because I'm not doing any of this for any other reasons
than it's what's best for my Children.
I just can't fathom how the desire to silence a litigant could outweigh the risk of becoming involved with the criminal
enterprise that has made absolutely no defense to the claims made against them, and they're being given a vehicle to just
walk into court on December 10th and obtain a final decree of divorce despite all of these issues, thus effectively
concluding the enterprise's affairs.
This message is not meant to intimidate the Court, harass or threaten, but is to merely communicate what I have been
forced into doing, and to reiterate the major issues that continue to compound.
If anyone else were in my position, it's hard to fathom that they'd feel like they were being treated fairly.
I hope that this Court, at the very least, understands why I have to do this. I've tried everything else to no avail, and every
pleading has been in good faith.
The opposing counsel, Petitioner, and CSD legal have been duly CC'ed in this email.
A few more key notes:
1. T ake special note how CSD legal is silent on the issue of their certificate of service sent in the intervention pleading
containing mismatched names. Holly Hayes is allegedly the attorney of record, yet she signs with a signature that
doesn't match any of the other 85 documents I've pulled containing Holly Hayes signature, and the signature line says
"Choya Burkley". It's comically fraudulent.
2. T ake special note how CSD legal has no basis to even be on the case considering they don't reply to objections served
to them, similar to opposing counsel here, and they're unable to enforce a facially void order, especially when the attorney
on the other side can't file anything in her own name despite being allegedly retained in her individual capacity.
3. T ake special note of how Holly Hayes, alleged attorney for the OAG, publicly left in 2018, claims to work at the SBA on
her public LinkedIn profile, yet somehow is the attorney of record for the OAG in this case.
4. T ake special note of how Cooper Carter, alleged attorney for Petitioner, publicly left Marx Altman and Joined Cantey
Hanger in 2022, yet here she claims to be employed by Marx Altman with an EFM registered to Cantey Hanger, and has
every filing submitted "on her behalf by Roderick Marx" who is not a party named in this suit.
5. T ake special note how Cooper Carter will have zero explanation as to why her EFM account is registered to her prior
employer despite this being brought to her attention time and time again, and won't have any explanation as to why she
hasn't responded to anything served on her.
6. T ake special note of the case docket, and notice that the Petitioner has only made one appearance in this matter on
January 16, 2024, despite there being three alleged hearings.
When you add in the document tampering, one-sided temporary orders, six ignored mandamus petitions, the sua sponte
final trial setting, and the illegal and deceptive nature upon which this case was founded in conjunction with everything
else mentioned above...it paints a very clear picture that defies all reasonable logic and warrants an immediate stay until
these issues can be resolved. It makes no sense.
Again, everything herein is not speculative, it's not accusatory - it's in the public domain, and remains unopposed. What's
stated here is already before the court, the only thing that doesn't exist is any substantive participation whatsoever by the
other side or a reasonable explanation by the Court.
This is not how this process is supposed to work, and everyone in this email chain knows it.
I hope the Court starts to make the right decisions, because the real party responsible for this entire mess remains the
Petitioner as the record facially establishes, and no further judicial resources should have to be expended in what should
have already been a remedied situation by operation of law.9/11/25, 11:06 AM Gmail - FW: Myers 322-744263-23
