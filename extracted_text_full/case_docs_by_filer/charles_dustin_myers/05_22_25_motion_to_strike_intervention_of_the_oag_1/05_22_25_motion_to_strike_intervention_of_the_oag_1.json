By following clearly established Texas  \nprescedent and utilizing the  \nII. LEGAL ANALYSIS  \nThe right to intervene in Texas is governed primarily by Rule 60 of the Texas Rules of \nCivil Procedure. This rule provides that: \"Any party may intervene by filing a pleading, subject \nto being stricken out by the court for sufficient cause on the motion of  any party.\"  In re R.M ., No. \n05-18-01127- CV (Tex. App. May 24, 2019) ; Smith v. City of Garland, 523 S.W.3d 234 (Tex. \nApp. 2017) ; R. Hassell & Co. v. Springwoods Realty Co., NO. 01- 17-00154 -CV (Tex. App. Apr \n19, 2018) . \nThis rule establishes that while intervention is permitted as a matter of right, it is not \nabsolute and remains subject to judicial oversight. The Texas Supreme Court has clarified that \nRule 60 \"authorizes a party with a justiciable interest in a pending s uit to intervene in the suit as \na matter of right.\" In re Union Carbide Corp., 273 S.W.3d 152, 154 (Tex. 2008) . However, this \nright is balanced against the court's obligation to ensure the efficient administration of justice. A. The Justiciable Interest Requirement  \nFor an intervention to be sustained, the intervenor must demonstrate a \"justiciable \ninterest\" in the pending suit. This requirement serves as a threshold that must be met before a court will allow an outside party to join ongoing litigation. According to Texas courts, an \nintervenor has a justiciable interest in a lawsuit \"when his interests will be affected by the litigation.\" Brown v. Freed, 03- 21-00556- CV (Tex. App. May 10, 2023) . This interest may be",

Procedure for Challenging an Intervention   \nAn important procedural aspect of Rule 60 is that an intervenor is not required to secure \nthe court's permission before intervening. Rather, \"the party who opposed the intervention has \nthe burden to challenge it by a motion to strike.\"  Guaranty Federal Sav. Bank v. Horseshoe \nOperating Co., 793 S.W.2d 652 (Tex. 1990) ; Musick v. Zamora, 03- 21-00555- CV (Tex. App. Apr \n27, 2023)  (citing  Guaranty Fed., 793 S.W.2d at 657).  \nOnce a motion to strike is filed, \"the burden shifts to the intervenor to show a justiciable \ninterest in the lawsuit.\" R. Hassell & Co. v. Springwoods Realty Co., NO. 01- 17-00154- CV (Tex. \nApp. Apr 19, 2018)  (citing  Union Carbide , 273 S.W.3d at 155);  In re R.M. , No. 05- 18-01127- CV \n(Tex. App. May 24, 2019)  (citing  In re Union Carbide Corp., 273 S.W.3d 152, 155 (Tex. 2008) ). \nC. Bur den on the OAG  \nBecause a motion to strike has now  been filed  in this case, the burden would shift to the \nOAG to demonstrate a justiciable interest in the litigation sufficient to overcome concerns about delay or prejudice. As established in In re R.M ., No. 05- 18-01127- CV (Tex. App. May 24, \n2019)  and R. Hassell & Co. v. Springwoods Realty Co., NO. 01- 17-00154- CV (Tex. App. Apr 19, \n2018) , \"the intervenor bears the burden to demonstrate a justiciable interest in the pending suit.\"  \nHere, t he OAG would need to articulate how its interests will be affected by the litigation \nand why its continued involvement is necessary despite its lack of action. If the OAG cannot demonstrate a sufficient justiciable interest, or if the court determines that any such interest is \noutweighed by the delay or prejudice being caused, the court would have grounds to strike the \nintervention.",

      "text": "4 \n III. APPLICATION  \nThe three -pronged test established in Guaranty Federal Savings Bank v. Horseshoe \nOperating Co., 793 S.W.2d 652, 657 (Tex. 1990)  provides a framework for this analysis. An \nintervenor must show that (1) it could have brought the same action, or any part thereof, in its \nown name, or if the action had been brought against it, it would be able to defeat recovery; (2) the intervention w ill not complicate the case by an excessive multiplication of the issues; and (3) \nthe intervention is almost essential to effectively protect the intervenor's interest.  \nThis framework should be applied within the instant matte r in the court \u2019s determination \nof whether to strike the intervention of the Office of the Attorney General . In the interest of \njudicial e conomy , the Respondent objects to any settings on this matter unti l the O ffice of the \nAttorney General furnishes a written response .  \nCONCLUSION AND PRAYER \nFor all the reasons stated herein, the Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, \nrespectfully requests that this H onorable Court:  \n1. Request a response from Holly Hayes, and request that she  demonstrate a justiciable \ninterest  in this matter  and clarify  the undue delay lack of participation in the \nproceedings ; \n2. If a justiciable interest cannot be d emonstrated  or if a response is not filed by a future \ndate deemed appropriate by the Court , order that the intervention pleading from the \nOffice of the Attorn ey General naming Holly Ha yes as counsel be stricken from the \nrecord ; \n3. Grant any other relief that the Court deems just and proper under the circumstances.  \nRespectfully submitted,",
