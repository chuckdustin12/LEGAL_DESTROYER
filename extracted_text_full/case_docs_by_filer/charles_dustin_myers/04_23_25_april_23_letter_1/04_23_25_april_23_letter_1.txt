Subject: Related case no tice and trial court actions 
Dear Ms. Hodges,   
This letter is filed pursuant to rule 9.6  of the Te xas Rules of Appellate Procedure .  
The undersigned acknowledges the recent involvement of the Texas Attorney 
General ’s office and  reiterates that the instant matter has two additional mandamus 
proceedings involving the same parties. ( 02-25-00164- CV, 02-25-00171 -CV). 
Furthermore, the trial court below (322nd) continues to risk further procedural 
errors by moving to set court proceedings outside the bounds of the Texas Rules of 
Civil Proce dure through informal email notifications.  
This letter serves as formal notice of concern that the trial court’s recent actions 
risk further procedural error and may necessitate additional appellate or emergency 
relief . This letter is submitted to apprise the Court of these developments and 
preserve the record should further filings become necessary.  
 
An objection has been duly filed in the trial court  and served on all parties of 
record. 
Respectfully submitted,  
  /s/ Charles Dustin Myers
