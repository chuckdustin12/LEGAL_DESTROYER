There is a general presumption that an attorney is acting with authority; however, that \npresumption is rebuttable. Breceda v. Whi , 187 S.W.3d 148, 152 (Tex. App.--El Paso 2006, no \npet.). If evidence or circumstances cast doubt on the attorney\u2019s authority, the presumption gives \nway and the attorney must prove actual authority. For example, an attorney who conducted a trial is presumed authorized to pursue an appeal, but that presumption can be rebutted with contrary evidence. Here, the  unusual facts surrounding Ms. Carter\u2019s involvement thoroughly rebut any \npresumption of her authority to represent the Respondent named in this matter, Morgan Michelle Myers, as detailed below .  \nIN RE: M.E.M., ET AL.    \n**CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, **   \n  \nPetitioner,   \n  \n PETITIONER\u2019S RULE 12 MOTION TO \nSHOW AUTHORITY  \nMORGAN MICHELLE MYERS,   \n  \nRespondent.   \n  \n2025 -03-21",

      "text": "2 \n I. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12 \u2013 Attorney Must Show Authority  \nA. Carter\u2019s Lack of Authority Indicia  \n 2. A party in a suit or proceeding pending in a court of this state may, by sworn written \nmotion stating that he believes the suit or proceeding is being prosecuted or defended without \nauthority, cause the attorney to be cited to appear before the court and show his authority to act. \nThe notice of the motion shall be served upon the challenged attorney at least ten days before the hearing on the motion. At the hearing on the motion, the burden of proof shall be upon the challenged attorney to show sufficie nt authority to prosecute or defend the suit on behalf of the \nother party. Tex. R. Civ. P. \n3. Multiple red flags call into question whether Carter is authorized \u2013 or even genuinely \nacting \u2013 as Ms. Myers\u2019s counsel, justifying relief under Rule 12. Petitioner respectfully requests \nthat the court requires  RODERICK D. MARX and COOPER L. CARTER to appear and show \ntheir authority to represent MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS in this matter to clear up the \nambiguity surrounding their representation.  \nB. Pleadings Filed by Proxy \n4. Every filing attributed to Carter in this case was filed through another attorney, Roderick \nMarx, rather than by Carter herself . Mr. Marx is the founding partner of the MAJ firm Carter \nformerly worked for, and he submitted documents \u201con her behalf \u201d through the electronic filing \nmanager.  In effect, Carter has not personally prosecuted or defended anything \u2013 someone else is \nhandling the filings. This raises serious doubts about whether Carter is acting  as counsel or whether \nMrs. Myers\u2019s case is being carried (or neglected) by others without a clear designation. An attorney \nof record should be the one signing filings or at least directly supervising and endorsing them; if",

Such proxy filings strongly indicate that Carter may lack authority or engagement \u2013 if she had authority, one would expect her direct parti cipation. Rule 12 is meant to prevent exactly \nthis sort of scenario where a suit might be conducted by someone without clear authorization. \nC. Employment/Firm Misrepresentation  \n5. Carter\u2019s own public statements conflict with the representations made to the court about \nher role. While her pleadings continued to identify her as \u201cCooper Carter, Marx Altman & \nJohnson\u201d (with a MAJ email address), her initial response in the instant cas e was filed by Roderick \nD Marx, signed by Cooper Carter with the Marx, Altman & Johnson letterhead, and then claimed that Cooper L. Carter was retained in her individual capacity. Further:  \ni. Carter\u2019s public Facebook profile claims that she is no longer employed with Marx, Altman , & Johnson.  \nii. Carter\u2019s public LinkedIn profile claims that she is no longer employed with Marx, Altman, & Johnson, and that she currently is employed at Cantey and Hanger, LLP. \niii. Carter\u2019s Electronic Filing Manager is registered under ccarter@canteyhangar.com . \nThis level of ambiguity is unnecessary and could be deliberate. In fact, Texas law requires attorneys \nto keep their State Bar profile updated with current employment information (Tex. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7\u200981.115), which currently reflects her employment with Marx, Altman & Johnson.  So the \nquestion remains : why would Carter u pdate her Texas State Bar profile to reflect her current \nemployer  but leave her social media and LinkedIn outdated?  \nD. Failure to Participate or Respond (Abandonment)",

      "text": "4 \n 6. Carter\u2019s complete failure to prosecute the divorce case for an extended period also \nundercuts any claim of active authority. An attorney who is truly acting with a client\u2019s authorization \nis expected to pursue the client\u2019s interests diligently \u2013 e.g. respond to motions, appear at hearings, move the case forward. Carter, however, has been conspicuously silent. She has not plead any \ndefense for her client, has not participated in any discovery .  \n7. Carter\u2019s abrupt appearance in this suit \u2014after months of silence in the divorce case \u2014\nmirrors the same confusion and procedural uncertainty that plagued the divorce action. This re -\nemergence appears tactical, not substantive, and should not obstruct the SAPCR\u2019s merits -based \nprogression. She has not mentioned anything about the children, their status, or how the current  \nsituation is what \u2019s best for them .  \n8. Carter\u2019s only notable action in the last six months related to her client has been to seek \nconsolidation of the SAPCR with the dormant divorce \u2013  essentially tethering the active custody \nmatter to a paralyzed divorce case which would further prejudice the children and delay the relief \nsought. \nII. Conflicts of Interest and Duty of Candor  \n9. Misrepresenting one\u2019s role or affiliation can also create conflicts of interest  and \nbreaches of the duty of candor. If an attorney signs pleadings stating it was \u201cnecessary to retain their legal services\u201d while filing under a firm\u2019s name, it muddles who was retained  \u2013 the individual \nlawyer or the firm. This ambiguity can prejudice the client\u2019s interests and the opposing party\u2019s understanding of the representation. \n10. For example, in the case at hand the answer explicitly stated,  \u201cIt was necessary for \nMorgan [Michelle] Myers to secure the services of COOPER L. CARTER, a licensed attorney, to",

Carter was operating  as a solo practitioner at that \npoint, the pleading arguably misled the court about who had been hired. This kind of \nmisrepresentation may violate the lawyer\u2019s candor toward the tribunal  (e.g. Tex. Disc. R. 3.03 \nor its equivalents) since it obscures a material fact \u2013 the lawyer\u2019s true status. Courts have held that \nlawyers must not omit facts necessary to keep statements from being misle ading. Failing to clarify \nthat the attorney is no longer with the named firm, it  could be seen as an omission that makes the \nfiling as a whole misleading.  \nIII. Unauthorized Filings and \u201cGhost\u201d Representation  \n12. Having documents filed by another attorney who has not formally appeared is another \nproblematic practice. In proper procedure, every pleading or motion must be signed by an attorney of record \u2013 i.e. a lawyer who has made an appearance in the case.  Texas is clear: \u201cEvery \npleading of a party represented by an attorney shall be signed by at least one attorney of record in his individual name.\u201d  If Attorney A is counsel of record, it is improper for Attorney B (who \nhas not appeared in the case) to file documents on A\u2019s behalf without disclosure or court permission.  \n13. In the example above, the e -filing system\u2019s certificate shows \u201cRoderick Marx on \nbehalf of Cooper Carter\u201d as the filer , neither of which have formally appeared. This kind of \n\u201cghost filing\u201d blurs who is responsible for the document. Courts frown upon undisclosed involvement of attorneys  because it can circumvent accountability and confuse the record. At \nbest, it is an irregular practice; at worst, it could be seen as misrepresentation to the court. Here, given the same circumstances exist in the divorce case which has been abandoned, Pet itioner \nbelieves the situation leans more towards misrepresentation.",

      "text": "6 \n 14. Procedurally, if an attorney who is not counsel of record submits a filing, the court \nmay treat that filing as nullity  or require it to be redone. No appearance means no authority to \nact. From an ethical standpoint, using another lawyer to file pleadings without notice may \nimplicate rules against aiding in rule violations. Lawyers are forbidden from assisting or \ninducing others to violate the rules  (see Tex. Disc. R. 8.04(a)(1) . If Attorney A  knows they \nshould appear officially but instead has Attorney B  file a document to evade a procedural \nrequirement, both attorneys tread on thin ice. They could be seen as trying to circumvent the rules of the tribunal. At a minimum, this lack of transparency undermines trust. The proper course would have been for the second attorney to file a notice of appearance (if joining the case) or for the original attorney to personally sign and file the pleading. Having someone \u201ccover\u201d a filing without formal acknowledgment is not a recognized practice. In short, any attorney involved in a case needs to either be of record or stay behind the scenes entirely . But if an \nattorney actually files or signs on behalf of the attorney of record, that person effectively steps \ninto the role of counsel without the court\u2019s knowledge , which is improper. It is better to err on \nthe side of disclosure \u2013 either by formal association of that attorney or by avoiding involvement in filing . \n15. A s pointed out, the Petitioner believes that this is occurring because Carte r\u2019s EFM \naccount is setup under her prior employer \u2019s email address. So why not change it to reflect the \ncorrect address and file your  own pleadings? Last ly, these same issues have been present in the \ndivorce matter, and although Carter was served with a Rule 12 motion in that case on September 20, 2024, she has yet to clear up t his issue.  \nIV .
