SUMMARY 
 
  Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, respectfully submits this notice to the  
court in compliance with the current temporary orders in effect. Despite the Respondent’s clear  
objection to the current orders in place, and despite their continuous and ongoing harm caused to  
the children in this case, Respondent has tried to comply with the orders to the best of his ability.  
  The orders require that the court be notified of any change of employment 
regarding the Respondent, and this notice is to make the court aware of such a change.  
CHANGE IN EMPLOYMENT  
  1. On January 14th, 2025, Respondent lost a source of his self -employment 
income, further exacerbating the damage done to his business and as a direct result of the current 
orders in place preventing him from accessing the family residence at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas  76148.  
  2. The loss of employment is a direct result of the inability to produce the level of 
content and provide the level of services that his client base are accustomed to, and will decrease the income of the Respondent significantly.   3. Since the orders have been put in place – Respondent went from making over 
$95,000 per year to now just $24,000 per year and reminds the court that the current orders in place were procured by fraud and are in no manner in the best interests of the children in this case.           
Respectfully submitted,
