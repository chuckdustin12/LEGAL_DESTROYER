NO. 322-744263-23 
IN THE 322nd DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY , TEXAS  
TO THE HONORABLE COURT:  
On Ma rch 17, 2025, I reminded the court coordinator that Hon . Munfor d and Hon.  
Kaitcer had not been reinstated to the case. (See motion to recuse, TAB E) After four months  of  
waiting and proactively communicating to this court that my youngest daughter was  
suffering medical neglect, time was of the essence, and I opened a separate SAPCR suit on the  
grounds that this case had been procedurally abandoned by the opposing party , as at the ti me of 
filing – there had been a pending DWOP motion that still remains un -opposed filed on January  
17, 2024. IN THE INTEREST OF M.E.M., C.R.M., two

MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS  
Petitioner,  
CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS , EMERGENCY NOTICE TO THE COURT  
Respondent.

I filed an EMERGENCY TRO with the court on March 24, 2024, and never received   
any response , and was turned a way at the last hour because of COOPER L. CARTER’s 
inability to follow the Te xas Rules of Procedure and consistent unethical behavior. She used a  
forward consolidation motion to block emergency relief, and filed it a week later. D espite turning  
the emergency TRO away, the same court sua sponte granted COOPER L. CARTER’ S  
consolidation  motion without a hearing, and now this court intends to proceed to set this matter  
for final trial.  
Now, today – Petitioner texts and informs me that my daughter, C.R.M., has to have  
EMERGENCY s urgery with anesthesia because of th e collective actions undertaken by both 
courts and the opposing counsel. EXHIBIT 1  This operation is expected to cost $2,584 and is the 
exact reason why the EMERGENCY TRO was filed.  
The direct and foreseeable result of the Petitioner ’s failure to act in the children ’s best 
interest s, and the Court’s failure to address the emergency relief sought has now materialized, 
causing both irreparable harm to my daughter and significant financial injury. This Court had full 
notice of the risks to the minor child’s health and chose, instead, to prioritiz e procedural 
manipulation over the welfare of the children involved  and give deference  to an attorney who has 
abandoned the case outright. 
Had the Emergency TRO been heard when presented, the medical neglect now requiring 
emergency surgery — and its associated cost of $2,584 — could have been avoided, the rights of M.1768 M.1768
M.1768 M.1768 M.1768 M.1768

the undersigned would be restored, and we could all start moving towards a real resolution of 
this matter.  
 It’s a travesty that this court is permitting this behavior to occur, because now , as the 
court can fully see, the claims raised by the undersigned had merit, as do the totality of the 
unopposed claims on this record. 
 The undersigned prays for change.
