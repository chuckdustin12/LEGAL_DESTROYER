Munfor d and Hon.  \nKaitcer had not been reinstated to the case. (See motion to recuse, TAB E) After four months  of  \nwaiting and proactively communicating to this court that my youngest daughter was  \nsuffering medical neglect, time was of the essence, and I opened a separate SAPCR suit on the  \ngrounds that this case had been procedurally abandoned by the opposing party , as at the ti me of \nfiling \u2013 there had been a pending DWOP motion that still remains un -opposed filed on January  \n17, 2024.

      "text": "I filed an EMERGENCY TRO with the court on March 24, 2024, and never received   \nany response , and was turned a way at the last hour because of COOPER L. CARTER\u2019s \ninability to follow the Te xas Rules of Procedure and consistent unethical behavior. She used a  \nforward consolidation motion to block emergency relief, and filed it a week later. D espite turning  \nthe emergency TRO away, the same court sua sponte granted COOPER L. CARTER\u2019 S  \nconsolidation  motion without a hearing, and now this court intends to proceed to set this matter  \nfor final trial.  \nNow, today \u2013 Petitioner texts and informs me that my daughter, C.R.M., has to have  \nEMERGENCY s urgery with anesthesia because of th e collective actions undertaken by both \ncourts and the opposing counsel. EXHIBIT 1  This operation is expected to cost $2,584 and is the \nexact reason why the EMERGENCY TRO was filed.  \nThe direct and foreseeable result of the Petitioner \u2019s failure to act in the children \u2019s best \ninterest s, and the Court\u2019s failure to address the emergency relief sought has now materialized, \ncausing both irreparable harm to my daughter and significant financial injury. This Court had full \nnotice of the risks to the minor child\u2019s health and chose, instead, to prioritiz e procedural \nmanipulation over the welfare of the children involved  and give deference  to an attorney who has \nabandoned the case outright. \nHad the Emergency TRO been heard when presented, the medical neglect now requiring \nemergency surgery \u2014 and its associated cost of $2,584 \u2014 could have been avoided, the rights of M.1768 M.1768\nM.1768 M.1768 M.1768 M.1768",
