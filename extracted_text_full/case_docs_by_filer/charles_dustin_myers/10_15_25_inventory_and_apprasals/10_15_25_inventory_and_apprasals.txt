LIABILITIES:    
$31,544.92   
Note:  
 These debts were incurred as a direct result of being abruptly removed from the home, 
which led to a significant increase in cost of living in order to remain near the children for as 
long as possible.

4 
 Supporting Exhibits : 
• Deficiency letter for CX -5 (Exhibit A)  
• Business affidavits from clients (regarding business disruption)  (Exhibit B)  
• Personal property insi de the CX -5 at the time of repossession was not returned and is 
considered lost.  
III. REAL PROPERTY INTERESTS  
Matrimonial Residence  
 While the debtor does not hold title to the matrimonial residence (property is owned by a 
third party), the debtor asserts potential legal rights under the  Texas Family Code  , including:  
• Right of possession:  The right to occupy the matrimonial home during the pendency of 
divorce proceedings  absent a valid court order.  
• Right of control:  The right to reasonable use of the property  for business and child care 
purposes . 
• Right of enjoyment:  The right to peaceful enjoyment without interference.  
• Right of exclusion:  Limited rights regarding access by third parties.  
• Right of disposition:  Potential community property interest subject to division in divorce 
proceedings , as Respondent needs time to transition.  
Current Status:  
 Debtor reports being prevented from accessing the matrimonial residence, which has

5 
 directly impacted both personal property and business operations. The current orders causing this 
loss of access and property were obtained fraudulently (as alleged).  A fair amount o f time b ack in 
the residence would serve the children ’s best interests a s it would prevent the total business 
failure . 
IV. PERSONAL PROPERTY

• System Manufacturer:  ASUS

6 
 Other Personal Property  
Note:  
 Debtor states that all other personal belongings, including clothing and other items, were 
disposed of illegally by the Petitioner. Debtor has been prevented from accessing the home to 
determine what personal property, if any, remains. Personal property in side the repossessed  CX-5 
was also lost and not returned. As a result, a complete inventory of personal property is not 
possible at this time.  
V. BUSINESS ASSETS AND VALUATION  
Business Overview  
 Debtor operates a home -based business providing real -time market data systems for stock 
and options trading analysis through the website  www.fudstop.io . The business generates 
revenue primarily through subscriber fees collected via Patreon  and relies on a specific and 
robust internet setup  as well as bandwi dth to provide the services  to scale.  
Current Business Status (as of October 2025)  
• Active Members:  124 (29 paid, 95 free)  
• Historical Members:  624 new members (519 paid, 105 free)  
• Cancelled Members:  360 (352 paid, 8 free)

 • Member Portfolio + Webhook Integration:  $60/month (5 members)  
 
Pre-Disruption Financial Performance (Patreon Data)  
  
Period  Monthly Recurring Revenue (Peak)  Annual Revenue  
2022  $14,342.52 (August 2022)  $100,991.73  
2023  $5,098.11 (January 2023)  $45,267.74  
2024  $2,873.59 (January 2024)  $22,277.17  
2025  $1,390.57 (February 2025)  $12,275.12 (annualized)  
 
Business Valuation Analysis  
 Given the business’s established recurring revenue, high growth trajectory, and SaaS/tech 
platform scalability,  industry -standard valuation multiples for scalable tech businesses are 6x –
10x annual recurring revenue . The business was fully prepared to scale, with all technical and 
subscriber infrastructure in place, and the forced removal from the home occurred at the critical 
moment of scaling, resulting in a catastrophic loss of value and opportunity.  
Valuation Period  Annual Revenue  Multiplier (Range)  Business Value (Range)  
2022 (Peak Year)  $100,991.73  6x – 10x $605,950 – $1,009,917  
2025 (Current)  $12,275.12  6x – 10x $73,651 – $122,751

8 
 Business Valuation Impact:  
 The forced displacement and inability to access the home -based business infrastructure 
caused a catastrophic decline in business value, representing a loss of approximately  $532,299 – 
$887,166 . 
Critical Business Assets  
• Subscriber base and relationships  
• Custom -built data analytics systems  
• Website infrastructure and intellectual property  
• Real-time data analysis algorithms  
• Reputation and market positioning in the financial services niche  
• Discord bots (currently in ~75 servers; potential revenue stream that cannot be utilized or 
monetized due to lack of access)  
• Mobile application (F.U.D.STOP on Android; cannot scale or monetize due to lack of 
infrastructure)  
Impact Statement  
 The business operations have been severely disrupted due to lack of access to the 
specialized internet connection and technical setup at the home address. This disruption occurred 
precisely as the business was ready to scale as a SaaS/tech platform, result ing in the loss of the 
ability to serve clients, monetize new features (including Discord bots and mobile applications), 
and realize the full market value of the business. The nature of the business requires ultra -low 
latency connections to process approxi mately 60 billion data points per minute, and any service

9 interruption causes critical business failure. The forced removal, with no time to transition or 
migrate systems, directly prevented the business from achieving its growth and revenue 
potential.  
VI. INCOME SOURCES
•Self-employment through client -based services
•YouTube content creation
•Patreon subscription revenue (significantly reduced)
