 NO. 322 -744263- 23 
IN THE 322ND DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS  
 
 
TO THE HONORABLE COURT:  
COMES NOW, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, Respondent, appearing pro se, and 
files this Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction, respectfully stating as follows: 
I. STATEMENT OF FACTS  
1. Respondent removed this case to the United States District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 
§1446(d) on December 2, 2024, immediately suspending state court jurisdiction upon 
removal.  
2. Following subsequent remand from the federal court, jurisdiction would only resume in 
state court upon filing a certified Notice of Remand pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1447(c). 
3. No such certified Notice of Remand has been filed with the Clerk of this Court as 
required by federal law, nor has Respondent been properly served with such notice. Morgan Michelle Myers,   
  
  
Petitioner,

 4. Petitioner and her counsel are procedurally unable to file or serve the required certified 
Notice of Remand electronically through the mandated Electronic Filing Manager ("EFM"), violating mandatory filing and service procedures as required by Texas Rule of 
Civil Procedure 21(f) . 
5. Additionally, current judicial recusal proceedings under Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 18a and 18b place jurisdictional authority for administrative issues with the Regional Presiding Judge, suspending any substantive authority by the trial court pending resolution. 
6. Due to these facts, state court jurisdiction remains suspended and cannot lawfully proceed.  
7. Because COOPER L. CARTE R cannot pro perly serve documents via the electro nic filing 
manager as required by law, she is unable to fulfill her obligations pursuant to Tex. R. 
Civ. P. 237a . 
8. Because COOPER L. CARTER cannot oppose this motion, it should be granted immediately and without the necessity of a hearing given all f acts presented herein are 
undisputed.  
 
REQUEST FOR RELIEF  
WHEREFORE, Respondent respectfully requests that this Court:  
1. GRANT this Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction, without hearing, as the jurisdictional facts and law are undisputed and clearly evidenced in the existing record;  
2. Dismiss all current actions and filings due to suspended jurisdiction; and

3 
 3. Provide all other relief the Court deems appropriate. 
Respectfully Submitted,
