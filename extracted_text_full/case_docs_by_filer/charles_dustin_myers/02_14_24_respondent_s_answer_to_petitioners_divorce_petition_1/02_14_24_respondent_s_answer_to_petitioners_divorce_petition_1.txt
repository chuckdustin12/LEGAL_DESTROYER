IN THE 322nd DISTRICT  COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY  
STA TE OF TEXAS  
Morgan Michelle Myers,  Cause No. 322 -744263 -23 
  
  
Petitioner,   
  
v.  
 Respondent's Answer to 
Petitioner's First Amended 
Petition for Divorce  
Charles Dustin Myers,   
  
Respondent   
  
  
 
To the Honorable Judge of said Court:  
The First Amended Petition for Divorce presents yet another series of critical flaws and 
misrepresentations, reflective of the pattern established in every document filed thus 
far by the opposing Party .¹ 
Respondent  has firmly denied th e allegations herein in multiple documents  within the 
court’s  possession , including an answer to the Protective Order , alongside several 
Exhibits  with supporting documentation . Particularly, t he Counter Petition for divorce , 
which more accurately reflects the true nature of the best interests of our children and  
does not contain false information or inaccuracies aimed at gaining an unfair 
advantage,  has yet to be considered .  
Based on the for thcoming inaccuracies, the false allegations, and the clear oversight 
by Counsel, the Res pondent moves the Court to reset Cause No. 322 -744263 -23 which 
would immediately restore sta bility to the children ’s lives, give all parties involved 
time for an appropriate conference , and to follow the court procedures properly, and 
effectively , which would serve the best interest s of our dau ghters.  
¹ Between December 14th, 2023, and December 2 2nd, 2023, the Petitioner filed for an Emergency 
Protective Order , a Divorce Petition, a Protective Order, and instigated an Eviction suit.  Please see the 
EMERGENCY MOTIO N filed with the court on 0 2/09/2024.  Envelope# 8435915 6

INACCURACIES OF PETITION /DENIAL  
This section  of this do cument  will refere nce the corresponding numbered sections 
found in the First Amended Petition for Divorce.  
 
6. Dates of Marriage and Separation  
1. December 1st, 2023,  is not just inaccurate; it is a blatant  
misrepresentation of our living situation. Our cohabitation, verified by 
multiple documents accepted by this Court,  continued unabated, 
reflecting a conscientious effort to preserve normalcy for our daughters 
during an especially sensitive time. The date of separation came on 
January 1 6th, 2024 – without a hearin g, which has been detrimental  and 
the focal -point of th ese proceedings  by the Petitioner . 
7. Grounds for Divorce  
2. Petitioner claims the marriage became insupportable due to discord or 
conflict of personalities. This is inaccurate. The divorce was announced 
without any prior attempt at counseling, communication, therapy, or any 
visible signs of marital discord  around the holiday  season.  
 
8. Children of the Marriage  
3. The petition inaccurately asserts that  no court -ordered 
conservatorships, guardianships, or relationships affecting the children 
of this marriage  were in place at the time of filing, which is another 
blatant inac curacy  and oversight.  
4. At the time of filing, orders were in place based on false claims from 
the Petitioner, hindering my work and damaging the relationship with 
my children. Opposing counsel was appointed on or around January 
22nd, 2024,  on last minute notice , which lead to a case continuance  – 
which extended the Tempor ary Orders currently in place at that time to 
the reset date of February 1st, 2024.

6. The  request for the exclusive right to designate the primary residence 
of the children is detrimental, as the Petitioner  is employed part -time 
and has no desire to acquire full time employment and  has 
demonstrated a pattern of deception that has destabilized the children's 
lives and  damaged my ability to provide for them , which directly 
impacts them.  
7. This oversight shows the consequences  of not conducting proper  
discovery  by opposing Counsel , and that this case is deeply rooted in 
misinformation , while the facts have been ignored outright.  
11. Request for Temporary Orders and Injunction  
8. The requests outlined in this section are baseless and appear designed 
to harass and complicate co -parenting. Cohabitation was maintained for 
45 days post -divorce announcement, disrupted only by court 
intervention on false pretenses.  Once again, the opposing Party must 
maintain the need for protection  despite cohabiting without court 
intervention for 4 6 days , during which I was served three times . 
Respondent would ironically argue that the protection would have made 
more sen se if been filed by himself rather than the Petitioner . 
13. Request for Temporary Orders Concerning Use of Property  
9. The requests are baseless and appear designed to harass and 
complicate co -parenting. Cohabitation was maintained for 45 days post -
divorce announcement, disrupted only by court intervention on false 
pretenses.  Once again, the opposing Party must maintain the need for 
protection  despite cohabiting without court intervention for 4 6 days , 
during which I was served three times . Respondent would ironically 
argue that the protection would have made more sen se if been filed by 
himself rather than the Petitioner . 
14. Request for Temporary Orders Regarding Children  
10. The request for orders regarding children lacks a factual  basis and 
fails to protect the children's interests. The petitioner’s  previous request 
for an Emergency

Protective Order was denied,  and was filed maliciously,  illustrating the 
baselessness of claims for protection.  The cohabitation achieved 
aforementioned  directly contradicts the need for such orders .  
15. Request for Temporary Orders Concerning Use of Property  
11. Petitioner's Coun sel request ed temporary orders despite orders 
already existing at the time of this filing. These requests were made 
without any hearing and are, therefore, just as all other allegations 
made in this document, based off of  unfounded claims of F amily 
Violence.  
16. Attorney's Fees, Expenses, Costs, and Interest  
12. Respondent challenges the necessity and purpose of the Petitioner  
securing legal services from Cooper L. Carter , as she expressed h er lack 
of desire  to represent the Petitioner for the divorce case , only seeming 
interest ed in the Protective Order case, and wou ld questio n her desire to 
represent the Petitioner had it not been required by the Honorable 
Judge of this Court , as corroborated by the oversights pointed out within 
this document.  
17. Prayer  
13. Petitioner's prayer, based on temporary injunctions and orders, is 
plagued by inconsistencies and contradictions, with no regard for the 
children's well -being.  This is further compounded b y the lack of 
competence from the opposing Counsel to get crucial facts such as the 
living arrangement s in line 6 . 
RESPONDENT ’S PRAYER  
Respondent, Charles Dustin Myers, affirms under penalty of perjury that the 
statements herein are true and accurate to the best of his knowledge, supported by 
substantial documentation and evidence duly filed and accepted by the clerk of  this 
Court.  
It is with utmost respect yet resolute conviction that Respondent prays for the Court to 
strike the Petitioner’s First Amended Petition for Divorce from the record  due to its’ 
inconsistent and inaccurate nature .

Therefore, Respondent earnestly requests that the Court grant the following relief:  
1. Reset the cas e to restore the conditions prior to court intervention . 
 
2. Set a fair and expedited hearing to address these matters thoroughly, ensuring 
all parties can present their case and the children's best interests are held 
paramount.  Respondent  suggest s a hearing date for March 14th, 2024 as the 
Opposing Counsel has alr eady disclosed this availability , and the C ourt has 
already set time aside for this date in regards to the  EMERGENCY MOTION 
filed, as reference d on page 1 of this docu ment.  
 
3. Consider the pattern of deceit and manipulation exhibited by the Petitioner 
throughout these proceedings , and the operation of non -facts b y opposing 
Counsel,  and weigh any new claims with a heightened level of scrutiny , as 
Respondent has retained consistent pleadings th roughout this case.  
 
4. Award full custody to the Respondent, who is best positioned to meet the 
children's needs and provide a stable, nurturing environment, while also 
facilitating a constructive relationship with the Petitioner.  
 
 
5. Respondent reassures the Court that reinstating him to the family home and 
with full custody of his children poses no risk of harm or violence; on the 
contrary, it promises the continuation of peaceful cohabitation and the 
nurturing environment his daughters need. The Petitioner retains the right to 
remain in the home or choose alternate accommodations, but it is  imperative 
for the children’s sake that their lives not be disrupted by ongoing litigation 
over baseless allegations.   
 
6. The Respondent will make an ac tive and conscious  effort to ensure the bond 
between the Petitioner and the children is upheld and  is committed to ensuring  
that the children have unfettered access to both parents, a principle the  
Petitioner has willfully  neglected. Awarding the Respondent custody will enable 
the children to sustain the stable and loving home they are accustomed to, 
without the unnecessary upheaval that has marked recent months .
