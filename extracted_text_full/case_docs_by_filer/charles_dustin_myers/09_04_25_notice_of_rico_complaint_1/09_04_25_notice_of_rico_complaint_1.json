On January 16, 2024, this Court ordered the Respondent to vacate his residence and \ndivested him of the custody of his children, dispossessed him of his business, and failed to consider the facially contradictive and misleading pleadings filed by the Petiti oner in this matter, Morgan Michelle Myers.  \n2. As warned through several pleadings, notices, and several mandamus proceedings \u2013 this suit was brought in bad faith by the Petitioner, and there is currently litigation in the Western District of Oklahoma pursuing RICO damages against the Petitioner and her co-conspirator, Daniel Kenneth Branthoover.  \n3. The Respondent intends to appeal the decision to dismiss the case to the 10\nth Circuit \nas there exists a circuit split regarding the relatedness and continuity elements of the claim, which were the exact two elements the court found lacking in its\u2019 order of dismissal.",

JUDGE KAITCER, ATTORNEY COOPER L. CARTER, AND PETITONER MORGAN \nMICHELLE MYERS  \n 5.

On October 7, 2024, Respondent filed a joint motion to recuse District Judge James \nMunford and Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer. He filed the pleading through the electronic \nfiling manager, and served it upon all parties of record in one document which was hyperlinked, contained all exhibits, and was notarized.(DKT NO. 227)  18. On October 8, 2024, District Judge James Munford sent an order of referral to \nRegional Presiding Judge David L. Evans, declining to recuse himself.  (DKT NO. 227)  19. On October 8, 2024, Court Coordinator Lindsey Baker emailed a receipt of this \ntransaction, where it was discovered that the original motion to recuse, as filed, had been modified to not include the exhibits or the affidavit.  (DKT NO. 230 -231) \n 20. Upon pointing this out to Lindsey Baker, she confirmed that the pleading had been e -\nfiled and the full document was in the possession of the court. (DKT NO. 230-231)  21. Unsatisfied with this response, Respondent asked for clarification as to why the \ndocument did not include the exhibits and affidavits, and pointed out a significant file size \ndiscrepancy between the motion that was submitted to the court, and the one forwarded to the \nRegional Presiding Judge. (DKT NO. 230-231)  22. No further correspondence was received from Lindsey Baker on this date, and the \nfollowing day an amended order of referral was emailed to the Respondent, this time with the Respondent\u2019s motion split into three separate files. The justification for thi s modification was \nallegedly due to the \u201csize of the pleading\u201d as indicated by Lindsey Baker. (DKT NO. 230 -\n231). The pleading\u2019s hyperlinks were removed.  \n 23. Based on Federal Law, these actions constitute conduct of an enterprise through a \npattern of racketeering activity, as explained below.",

      "text": "III. BACKGROUND AND RELEVANT LAW  \nA. Federal RICO and Predicate Acts  \n 24. The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provides both \ncriminal and civil remedies for injuries caused by a pattern of racketeering activity. To state a \ncivil RICO claim, a plaintiff must allege (1) conduct, (2) of an enterprise, (3) t hrough a pattern, \n(4) of racketeering activity, and (5) injury to business or property by reason of the racketeering \nactivity. Racketeering activity is defined broadly and includes acts indictable under federal mail and wire fraud statutes, as well as  extortion under the Hobbs Act . \n 25. Extortion under the Hobbs Act includes obtaining property from another, with \nconsent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right, and must affect interstate commerce.  \nB. Texas Law: Fraudulent Securing of Document Execution   26. Texas Penal Code \u00a7 32.46 makes it a criminal offense to cause another person, with \nintent to defraud or harm, to sign or execute any document affecting property or pecuniary interest without that person\u2019s effective consent. This provision is relevant to th e claims above \nthat a judge or other party compelled the execution of a document containing false statements that affected the respondent\u2019s business or property interests (Tex. Pen. Code \u00a7 32.46 Fraudulent Securing of Document Execution, Tex. Pen. Code \u00a7 32.46 (2025)). However, this claim w ould \nneed to be investigated by the Office of the Attorney General.  \nC. Judicial Immunity  27. Judicial immunity is a well -established doctrine that protects judges from civil \nliability for acts performed in their judicial capacity, even if those acts are alleged to be done maliciously or corruptly. However, immunity does not apply to (1) acts taken in the clear absence",

The distinction between judicial and nonjudicial acts, \nand between acts within and outside jurisdiction, is critical in determining whether immunity applies  in this scenario.  \nIV. Analysis \nD. Compelling Execution of a Fraudulent Order  \n 28. The facts allege that Associate Judge Kaitcer, attorney Cooper L. Carter, and \nPetitioner Morgan Michelle Myers knowingly signed and attempted to compel the respondent to sign a court order containing false statements, prepared by the incorrect attorney , and referenced  \na hearing that did not occur  on a motion that was never served on the Respondent .  \n 29. Despite his refusal to sign, the Court rendered this fraudulent order anyway, which \naffected the respondent\u2019s business and property interests, including his ability to serve interstate \nclients , thus creating an effect on interstate commerce.  The use of false statements in a court \norder, which was intended to deprive the Respondent of property or business interests, could also \nbe viewed as extortion under color of official right because the judge used his position to compel \ncompliance.  \n 30. Under Texas law, causing another to sign a document affecting property or pecuniary \ninterest, with intent to defraud or harm and without effective consent, is a criminal offense (Tex. Pen. Code \u00a7 32.46 Fraudulent Securing of Document Execution, Tex. Pen. Code \u00a7 32.46 (2025)). Because the respondent was compelled to sign, and because the court rendered the order as if \nconsented to despite his refusal, and because this was done with intent to harm or defraud  by the \nPetitioner and her attorney , this support s a claim of fraudulent document execution under S tate \nlaw.",

      "text": "E. Tampering With Court Filings  \n 31. The facts further allege that after a motion to recuse was filed, court staff (Lindsey \nBaker) through directive or on her own accord, altered the filing by removing exhibits and \naffidavits, splitting the document, and removing hyperlinks after the motion was filed and served. Because these actions were plausibly intended to interfere with the respondent\u2019s rights \nand to affect the outcome of the recusal process, and because they involved the use of mail or \nwire communications, they can also be character ized as predicate acts under RICO . \nF. Pattern, Relatedness, and Continuity  32. RICO requires a pattern of racketeering activity, which means at least two predicate \nacts that are related and amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity. The facts allege multiple acts \u2014compelling execution of a false order, tampering with c ourt filings, and possibly \nother acts \u2014over a period of time, all directed at depriving the respondent of property or business \ninterests  which affect interstate commerce . Because these acts are sufficiently related and \ncontinuous, they could arguably satisfy the pattern requiremen t.  \nG. Injury to Business or Property  \n 33. A civil RICO plaintiff must show direct injury to business or property by reason of \nthe racketeering activity. The Respondent alleges that the false order and related acts deprived \nhim of his business, affected his ability to serve interstate clients, and dispossessed him of property. Because these injuries were proximately caused by the alleged predicate acts, both in causing the harm directly, and preventing equitable relief, this element is satisfied.  \nH. Judicial Immunity: Scope and Exceptions  \n 34. Judicial immunity generally bars civil suits against judges for acts performed in their \njudicial capacity, even if those acts are alleged to be done with malice or corruption. However,",

      "text": "immunity does not apply to acts taken in the clear absence of all jurisdiction or to nonjudicial \nacts. \nI. Acts in Clear Absence of Jurisdiction  \n 35. The respondent argues that the associate judge lacked jurisdiction to sign the order \nbecause the order was to be prepared by an attorney who had been terminated, and because the emergency motion could be seen as a de novo request, depriving the associate j udge of \njurisdiction. If a judge acts in the clear absence of all jurisdiction, judicial immunity does not apply. However, courts have interpreted \"clear absence of jurisdiction\" narrowly; mere legal error or exceeding authority is usually insufficient. The facts would need to show that the judge had no subject -matter jurisdiction whatsoever over the matter, not merely that he acted contrary \nto procedure or made a legal error.  \n 36. The Respondent  asserts that because the original agreement required an attorney who \nwas no longer active on the case to prepare it, and because the agreement had strict time \nstandards ordered by the same judge, and because of the language used in the agreement, he had no jurisdiction to render them into effec t. \nJ. Nonjudicial Acts  \n 37. The respondent also argues that modifying a recusal motion after it was filed is a \nnonjudicial act, or at least an act outside the scope of judicial function. If the act is administrative or ministerial, rather than judicial, immunity may not apply. Ho wever, actions taken in managing \ncourt filings are often considered part of the judicial process, unless clearly outside the scope of judicial or quasi -judicial duties.  Pursuant to Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, \nwhen a motion to recuse is  filed, the Judge shall take no further action in the case until it is",

      "text": "decided. The act of modifying the recusal after it was filed is an act taken outside of all \njurisdiction by statute.  \nK. Application to Court Staff  38. Court staff, such as coordinators, may be entitled to quasi -judicial immunity for acts \nperformed at the direction of a judge or as part of the judicial process. However, if the staff member acts outside the scope of their authority or engages in condu ct that is not part of the \njudicial process, immunity may not apply.  \nV . Predicate Acts  \nL. Mail Fraud  \n 39. The facts allege that false court orders and documents were prepared and entered, \ncontaining material misrepresentations about the parties' consent, the identity of the preparer, and the occurrence of hearings. If these documents were transmitted via m ail (including electronic \ncourt filing systems, which courts have recognized as sufficient for the mail fraud statute), and if \nthe intent was to deprive the respondent of property or business interests, these actions could constitute mail fraud. The elemen ts\u2014scheme to defraud, use of mail, and specific intent \u2014are all \npotentially satisfied if the facts are as alleged ( U.S. v. Ratcliff , 488 F.3d 639 (5th Cir. \n2007);  Burzynski, In re , 989 F.2d 733 (5th Cir. 1993);  Heden v. Hill , 937 F.Supp. 1230 (S.D. Tex. \n1996)).  40.

These actions were allegedly intended to interfere with the respondent's rights and affect the out come of the recusal process.  \n 42. The intent to defraud is supported by the alleged purpose of interfering with the \nrespondent's rights and affecting the outcome of the recusal process. The injury to business or property is present because these actions deprived the respondent of a fair hearing or the ability to protect his business and property interests . \nM. Extortion Under the Hobbs Act  43. The Hobbs Act defines extortion as obtaining property from another, with consent, \ninduced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right, and affecting interstate commerce. The facts allege that a judge, attorney, and party knowingly signed and attempted to compel the respondent to sign a court order containing false statements, which would have resulted in direct injury to the respondent\u2019s business and property, including his ability to serve interst ate clients. If the judge or other officials used their official \nposition to obtain property or business interests from the respondent to which they were not entitled, this could constitute extortion under color of official right . See U.S. v. Edwards , 303 \nF.3d 606 (5th Cir. 2002)).  \n 43.

      "text": "N. Specific Intent to Defraud  \n 43. The specific intent to defraud is supported by the allegations that the order contained \nknowingly false statements, was prepared by the wrong attorney, and was rendered effective \ndespite the respondent's refusal to sign and the lack of a proper hearing. The deprivation of business and property interests, especially those affecting interstate commerce, satisfies the injury requirement for a RICO claim (Green v. Davis , Civil Action 23-359-BAJ -EWD (M.D. La. \nMay 30, 2023)).  44. Additionally, the use of judicial authority to compel compliance with a fraudulent \norder could be characterized as extortion under color of official right, another recognized predicate act under RICO (Abraham v. Singh, 480 F.3d 351 (5th Cir. 2007)).  \nO. Pattern of Racketeering Activity  \n 45. RICO requires a pattern of racketeering activity, meaning at least two predicate acts \nthat are related and amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity ( Megatel Homes, \nLLC v. Moayedi , Civil Action 3:20-CV -00688-L (N.D. Tex. Nov 16, 2021);  D&T Partners v. \nBaymark Partners LP, Civil Action 3:21- CV-1171-B (N.D. Tex. Oct 21, 2022)). The facts allege \nmultiple acts \u2014compelling execution of a fraudulent order, tampering with court filings, and \npossibly other acts \u2014over a period of time, all directed at depriving the respondent of property or \nbusiness interests affecting interstate commerce.  \n 46. Because  these acts are sufficiently related (i.e., part of the same scheme to deprive the \nrespondent of property and business interests  through the same Family Law matter ) and \ncontinuous (i.e., has been pending for nearly two years with a facially troubling record), they satisfy the pattern requirement for a RICO claim ( Megatel Homes, LLC v.

Assuming all facts as true, the conduct described herein  could constitute federal \npredicate acts of mail fraud, as well as potential extortion under color of official right, all of \nwhich are recognized predicate acts for RICO purposes. These acts include the use of electronic and mail communications to further a scheme to defraud the respondent of property and business \ninterests through fraudulent court orders and tampering with court filings.  48. Despite the significant obstacle of judicial immunity in this circumstance, the Court \nhas left the Respondent no choice but to pursue these claims to protect his children, expose the Petitioner\u2019s criminal activity that\u2019s the foundation for all of this , and to substantiate his claims \nthat have been on the record, unopposed, and unaddressed for nearly two years.  49. Judicial and quasi -judicial immunity generally shield judges and court staff from civil \nliability for acts performed in their judicial capacity and within their jurisdiction, but this immunity does not apply to nonjudicial acts or acts taken in the clear absence of all jurisdiction; thus, if the judge and coordinator altered a recusal motion after it was filed \u2014an act arguably \noutside judicial capacity and jurisdiction \u2014they may not be immune. By contrast, attorneys and \nprivate parties (such as opposing couns el and the Petitioner) do not enjoy judicial immunity and \nmay be liable under RICO . \n 50.
