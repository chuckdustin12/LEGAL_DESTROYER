no response from either individual. Swift injunctive relief is needed to safeguard the well-
being of the children – including immediate medical needs, schooling needs, financial needs, and emotional needs that the Petitioner has the ability, desire, and duty to satisfy. 
The Respondent has disrupted the stable living environment enjoyed by the 
children up until the Petitioner's unlawful exclusion on March 6, 2024. They have been left without a Father for over thirteen months without any legal justification and are now being raised by their elderly great-grandparents in place of their Father. 
The forthcoming and undisputed facts uncover the true intent behind the 
Respondent's actions and clearly demonstrate the need for the Petitioner's immediate re-
entry into their lives.  
I. STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION
This Court has jurisdiction, and the authority grants the requested relief because 
no valid existing orders bar such action. The only prior orders affecting the parties were 
issued in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County, but those orders are void and of no legal effect. Under Texas Family Code § 201.013(b), an associate judge's order does not become final unless and until the referring district court judge signs the order. 
Moreover, the orders claim that all parties agree to the terms of the order despite 
the Petitioner's signature being absent. In the prior proceedings (Cause Nos. 322-744263-23 in the 322nd District Court), an associate judge signed a "temporary" order on March 14, 2024 that purported to be an agreement between the parties. Critically, no district judge of the 322nd District Court ever signed or adopted that order, as required by law. TEX. FAM. CODE Sec. 201.013. Given this fact, the orders have no legal eff ect and M.2303 M.2303
M.2303 M.2303 M.2303 M.2303

should be declared void by this court, or in the alternative, voidable, and vacated without 
delay. There is effectively no valid court order currently governing the parties' residence or conservatorship rights. This Court may therefore proceed to protect the children's welfare and the parties' rights as justice requires, unimpeded by the defective 322nd District Court order.  
Furthermore, this court has jurisdiction because the Respondent cannot argue that 
the related cause number retains dominated jurisdiction. Texas law does allow a court to lose dominant jurisdiction if the party with the first suit proceeded in bad faith or the suit is not actively pursued. Both apply here, as demonstrated below. The first suit was unquestionably brought in bad faith, and the case hasn't been actively pursued for over six months by the opposition, leaving the children in procedural limbo and their needs unaddressed. 
II. STATEMENT OF FACTS
1. On December 12, 2023, Petitioner discovered over 6,500 text messages
exchanged between the Respondent and an individual named DAMEN GAULT KAZLAUSKAS by checking the usage history on the joint AT&T account owned by the Respondent's grandmother and paid for by the Petitioner, who had access to the account. (these records are voluminous and will be provided at hearing)

III. IMMEDIATE NEED FOR RELIEF
64. Every day that Petitioner remains barred from his home and children inflicts
irreparable injury on both Petitioner and the children. Irreparable harm means an injury that cannot be adequately compensated for money damages or corrected later. That is exactly the case here.  M.2312 M.2312
M.2312 M.2312 M.2312 M.2312

65. Petitioner is being deprived of the irreplaceable experience of parenting his
children during their formative years. No amount of monetary compensation or later 
visitation can make up for the lost time, missed milestones, and emotional bonding that has been denied for over a year. Courts have recognized that interference with custodial or visitation rights constitutes irreparable harm, as time lost with one's child is gone forever. The children are likewise losing the benefit of a father's love, guidance, and daily care – a harm that is unquestionably irreparable. If this wrongful separation continues, the risk increases that the parent -child bond could be permanently damaged. Reunification 
becomes harder as more time passes; thus the urgency is extreme.  
66. The children have been suffering confusion, instability, and emotional distress
due to the sudden absence of Petitioner and the drastic changes imposed by Respondent. They went from having both parents in their daily life to seeing only one parent, with no satisfactory explanation. Respondents' insertion of a new father- figure (Mr. Kazlauskas) 
has exacerbated their confusion and anxiety. This kind of emotional turmoil in young children can lead to long-term psychological issues – a classic irreparable injury, as the court cannot later repair the trauma inflicted on a child's sense of security. Restoring Petitioner's presence is needed now to begin healing the damage and to reassure the children that their father has not abandoned them. The more time that passes, the deeper the potential harm to the children's mental health.  
67. Petitioner's fundamental right to maintain his familial relationship with his
children (protected by the U.S. and Texas Constitutions) is being violated. Such a violation is inherently irreparable. Deprivation of one's home – being ousted without cause – is also a profound personal harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law. M.2313 M.2313
M.2313 M.2313 M.2313 M.2313

Petitioner has effectively been made a stranger to his own family and property based on 
false pretenses. If the Court does not act, the Petitioner  will continue to suffer intangible 
harms such as loss of income, anguish, and the erosion of his role as a father, none of which can be quantified or compensated later.  
IV. THE RESPONDENT'S MISCONDUCT
Perjury and Aggravated Perjury (Tex. Penal Code §§ 37.02–.03) 
68. Texas law makes it a crime to make false statements under oath. Perjury
occurs when a person, with intent to deceive, makes a false statement under oath in a proceeding where an oath is required. 
69. If the false statement is made in connection with an "official proceeding" and
is material, it becomes Aggravated Perjury, a third -degree felony. In civil cases, 
knowingly submitting false affidavits or testimony can also constitute perjury and be treated as a fraud upon the court. Courts have recognized that false sworn statements in family law matters are serious misconduct, undermining the judicial process and potentially warranting sanctions or even criminal referral (e.g., Skepnek v. Mynatt, 8 S.W.3d 377, 381 (Tex. App. – El Paso 1999) (attorney sanctioned $30,000 for filing false affidavit).  
70. Here, Respondent swore to multiple false statements under oath, meeting all
elements of perjury and aggravated perjury. For example: 
False Affidavit of Indigency M.2314 M.2314
M.2314 M.2314 M.2314 M.2314

71. On December 18, 2023, Respondent filed a sworn "Affidavit of Inability to
Pay" court costs, claiming she had only $20 in her bank account. This statement was 
knowingly false. Just two days prior, Respondent had transferred $1,576.00 in marital funds to herself, as confirmed by text messages with her relative (Dan Branthoover) on December 16. She then appeared in court swearing she was penniless and could not afford the $400 filing fee. In that same affidavit, Respondent also lied that she alone paid certain expenses (two car loans and $800 rent plus utilities), when in fact Petitioner had been paying those bills; he continued to pay for the vehicles Respondent claimed to finance on her own. Bank statements and financial records will clearly establish this fact on the merits. Respondent's counsel has never refuted these facts. Thus, Respondent made multiple false statements under oath, meeting Penal Code § 37.02. Because these affidavits were filed in court proceedings and were material to the case (securing a fee waiver and influencing the court's actions), they also qualify as aggravated perjury under § 37.03. Each false statement was material to issues before the court (Respondent'sfinancial status and credibility), satisfying the materiality requirement.  
False Statements in Protective Order Filings  
72. Respondent submitted false sworn statements in her applications for
protective orders. Texas Family Code § 82.009 requires that an application for a temporary ex parte protective order "contain a detailed description of the facts" of alleged family violence and be sworn as true by the applicant. Respondent sought an ex parte protective order on or about Dec. 14, 2023, claiming abuse, yet on Dec. 22, 2023, she was photographed laughing and playing with the children alongside Petitioner – conduct wholly inconsistent with someone in fear of imminent harm. In fact, that same day, she M.2315 M.2315
M.2315 M.2315 M.2315 M.2315

had applied for a second protective order against the Petitioner with similar allegations. 
No credible evidence of family violence was ever presented in thirteen months of litigation but has been used as a barrier from accessing the home where the Petitioner is needed.  
73. The contextual evidence of falsity (her normal familial behavior with
Petitioner the same day she sought Protection) defeated  her sworn claims of "fear" or 
violence and display that they were indeed fabricated. At the very least, her contradictory sworn assertions – e.g. claiming on Dec. 18 to have an "active" protective order based on family violence (to justify a divorce waiver) when in truth none existed – demonstrate a reckless disregard for the truth under oath. 
74. These false protective order filings were not isolated incidents but part of a
calculated strategy to remove Petitioner from the family home and children's lives. The timing of these filings —immediately after the discovery of Respondent's extramarital 
relationship with Mr. Kazlauskas—reveals their true purpose: not to protect against genuine violence, but to preemptively silence Petitioner and prevent him from exposing Respondent's infidelity and financial misconduct. By falsely claiming fear while simultaneously engaging in normal family activities with Petitioner, Respondent demonstrated the fabricated nature of her allegations.  
75. The pattern of deception is unmistakable: Respondent drained the family bank
account on December 15 -16, filed false indigency claims on December 18, falsely 
claimed an existing protective order in her divorce petition that same day, then filed yet another protective order application on December 22—all while continuing to interact M.2316 M.2316
M.2316 M.2316 M.2316 M.2316

normally with Petitioner at home. This coordinated sequence of events shows a 
premeditated plan to use the legal system as a weapon against Petitioner rather than as the shield of protection it was designed to be. 
Controlling Law 
76. False testimony or affidavits in a civil proceeding can warrant severe
consequences. While the proper remedy for "intrinsic" fraud (false statements on issues litigated at trial) is often a new trial or sanctions rather than voiding a judgment, courts do not hesitate to act on clear perjury. Texas courts have inherent authority to address fraud on the court, and criminal prosecution for aggravated perjury is a possibility for egregious 
lies under oath. Indeed, aggravated perjury in court proceedings is a felony punishable by 
2–10 years' imprisonment (Tex. Penal Code § 37.03(b)). 
77. That is precisely what has occurred in this case, and Respondent should face
some consequences for her actions, but Petitioner believes that prolonged incarceration would not be in the best interests of his children, but that some form of legal repercussion is necessary to deter similar behavior in the future. She has made no effort to defend these claims, no effort to prosecute her case, and the Petitioner prays that this court realize the severity of this situation on those effected most: the children.  
V. BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILDREN
78. The Texas Family Code references "the best interest of the child" 109 times
throughout its text, and throughout the entirety of the code itself – the word "always" only appears once. TEX. FAM. CODE. Sec. 153.002. (The best interest of the child shall M.2317 M.2317
M.2317 M.2317 M.2317 M.2317

always be the primary consideration of the court in determining the issues of 
conservatorship and possession of and access to the child.) 
79. Here, this statutory mandate was grossly violated by the Respondent and her
purported counsel, who have suddenly become active in the litigation here despite remaining silent for over eight months in the parallel case destined for dismissal.  
80. Indeed, the instant case reveals a Mother with an agenda to erase the parent
the children relied on the most from their lives despite a valid legal reason, and has disregarded their livelihood in the process. 
81. Respondent's conduct constitutes a blatant violation of the "best interest"
standard mandated by Texas Family Code §§ 153.001 and 153.002. Texas law declares it the public policy of this state to assure that children have frequent and continuing contact with parents who act in the child's best interest, to provide a safe and stable environment for the child, and to encourage both parents to share in raising the child. Moreover, the best interest of the child must always be the court's primary consideration in matters of conservatorship and access. Respondent has flagrantly defied these principles by prioritizing her extramarital relationship with Mr. Damen Kazlauskas over the emotional, psychological, and familial stability of her own children. 
Orchestrated Campaign of Deception at the Family's Expense 
82. The evidence reveals a disturbing pattern: Respondent orchestrated a
comprehensive campaign of deception that sacrificed her children's emotional well-being and family stability to pursue her extramarital relationship. This was not a series of isolated incidents but a calculated strategy that unfolded in precise sequence: M.2318 M.2318
M.2318 M.2318 M.2318 M.2318

83. First, Respondent engaged in an extramarital relationship with Mr. Kazlauskas
(evidenced by over 6,500 text messages); 
84. Second, upon discovery of this relationship, she immediately sought
assistance from Mr. Branthoover to draft legal documents; 
85. Third, she drained the family's financial resources ($1,576) that were intended
for the children's Christmas gifts; 
86. Fourth, she filed false protective order applications and a fraudulent indigency
affidavit;  
87. Fifth, she misrepresented to the court that an active protective order existed
when none did; 
88. Finally, she used these fraudulent filings to remove Petitioner from the family
home and children's lives. 
89. Each step in this sequence was designed not to protect the children but to
advance Respondent's personal agenda at their expense. The children have been collateral 
damage in Respondent's effort to reconstruct her life with Mr. Kazlauskas, who she now publicly acknowledges as her partner "since February 2024"—a relationship that began while she was still actively living with Petitioner and the children.  
Deception and Psychological Confusion of the Children 
90. Respondent has knowingly misled the minor children about the status of their
family by telling them that she and Petitioner are already divorced, even though the divorce is not final. This deliberate falsehood serves Respondent's personal narrative but M.2319 M.2319
M.2319 M.2319 M.2319 M.2319

wreaks emotional havoc on the children. They are left in a state of confusion—believing 
their family has been permanently fractured when in fact the legal marriage remains intact. By intentionally misrepresenting such a fundamental truth, Respondent has shown a willingness to confuse and emotionally harm her children to justify her own choices, in direct contravention of her duty to prioritize the children's emotional well-being. 
Prioritizing an Extramarital Relationship Over Family  
91. Compounding the harm, Respondent is openly celebrating a relationship with
Mr. Kazlauskas – a man with whom she entered an extramarital relationship while still married to Petitioner. She has flaunted this relationship and positioned Mr. Kazlauskas as 
a replacement father figure to the children, celebrating milestones with him that should be 
reserved for family. In doing so, Respondent elevates her personal relationship over her children's need for stability and continuity with their real father. This behavior sends the children a disturbing message: that their father's role in their lives is interchangeable or unimportant. Such a message is detrimental to the children's best interests, as it undermines their sense of security, identity, and trust in their family structure and the close relationship that they have shared with their father throughout their lives. 
Active Alienation and Erasure of the Father  
92. Respondent has gone to alarming lengths to minimize and erase Petitioner's
presence in the children's lives. She has introduced Mr. Kazlauskas to the children as if he were a new parent, while simultaneously telling the children that Petitioner (their father) is no longer in their lives. This calculated act of alienation strikes at the very heart M.2320 M.2320
M.2320 M.2320 M.2320 M.2320

of Texas public policy, which seeks to ensure children maintain frequent and continuing 
contact with both parents. 
93. Instead of fostering the father–child relationship, Respondent has deliberately
attempted to sever it. The children are being taught through Respondent's words and actions that their father has effectively disappeared and been substituted by a stranger, causing profound emotional damage and confusing the children about who their father is. This behavior is not only cruel; it is directly contrary to the children's best interests and Texas's clear directives that children benefit from the love and involvement of both parents.  
93. The children's current living situation—being raised primarily by elderly
great -grandparents rather than their capable and willing father—further demonstrates 
how Respondent's personal agenda has superseded the children's needs. Rather than allowing Petitioner to fulfill his parental role and provide daily care and support to the children, Respondent has relegated this responsibility to extended family members, depriving the children of their father's presence, guidance, and care during crucial developmental years. 
94. Respondent's systematic use of false protective orders, perjured testimony,
and procedural manipulation has created a legal fiction that has kept Petitioner from his children for over thirteen months. This separation was not based on any legitimate safety concern or the children's best interests, but solely on Respondent's desire to reconstruct her family unit with Mr. Kazlauskas at the center —effectively erasing Petitioner from the 
children's lives to accommodate her new relationship. M.2321 M.2321
M.2321 M.2321 M.2321 M.2321

95. The harm to the children from this prolonged, unjustified separation from their
father cannot be overstated. Research consistently shows that children benefit from the 
active involvement of both parents, and that unnecessary disruption of the parent-child bond can cause lasting psychological damage. By prioritizing her personal relationship over her children's need for both parents, Respondent has demonstrated a fundamental misalignment with the "best interest" standard that Texas law demands be the "primary consideration" in all matters affecting children.  
96. Despite the Respondent’s egregious actions, the Petitioner wishes her no ill
will as she is the mother of his Children and only seeks an amicable path forward that suits their best interests. As of now, the Children need their father, and this situation engineered by the Respondent shows that her fitness as a parent has been called into question, and her priorities are not in the correct place. Petitioner vows his return to the family home will only bring much needed stability to his children and will be in their best interests for their day -to-day livelihood. 
VI. PRAYER
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Petitioner respectfully prays that this Honorable Court: 
(1). Issue an immediate Temporary Restraining Order for the safety and welfare 
of the children without notice to Respondent, restraining Respondent from: 
a. Denying Petitioner access to the children;M.2322 M.2322
M.2322 M.2322 M.2322 M.2322

b. Denying Petitioner access to the family residence at 6641 Anne Court,
Watauga, Texas 76148; 
c. Disturbing the peace of the Children;
d. Disrupting the status quo of the children as it existed on March 6, 2024;
c. Removing the children from Tarrant County, Texas;d. Making disparaging remarks about Petitioner to or in the presence of
the children; 
e. Interfering with Petitioner's possession of and access to the children;
f. Destroying, removing, concealing, encumbering, transferring, or
otherwise harming or reducing the value of the property of the parties; 
g. Falsifying any records relating to the children or property;h. Misrepresenting any facts to the children regarding the marriage,
divorce proceedings, or Petitioner's role in their lives; 
i; Bringing the Children near DAMEN GAULT KAZLAUSKAS;  
(5). Set a hearing on Petitioner's request for a Temporary Injunction at the earliest 
possible date not later than 14 days from the electronic  delivery of this TRO to the 
Respondent; 
(6). After hearing, issue a Temporary Injunction containing the same prohibitions 
as this Temporary Restraining Order; M.2323 M.2323
M.2323 M.2323 M.2323 M.2323

(7). After trial, if no agreement can be reached, grant Petitioner primary 
conservatorship of the children; 
(8). After trial, if no agreement can be reached, grant Petitioner exclusive 
possession of the family residence until damages can be fully restored and alternative residency can be established  nearby the Children; 
(10). Grant such other and further relief to which Petitioner may be justly entitled. 
It’s been a long road. The Petitioner prays he may now return home to his children and prepare for this difficult time in a manner which comports with their fundamental needs. 
Thank you. Respectfully submitted,

MR 7.27
The children are suffering daily from their father being prevented
access to the marital home. The Respondent has prevented access
since March 6, 2024, knowing the Petitioner's need for the residence to work.
This has left the children without the care of either parent for the majority
of the time, and are being told that the divorce has been finalized
and that their father is a bad person.
Prior to the Respondent's removal, the Children were cared for both emotionally and financially by the Petitioner. The Respondent
knowingly and willingly sabotaged this relationship to further her own agenda with a separate relationship.
The emotional well-being and stability of the children have been destroyed, and their stable life has been dismantled
by the Respondent in bad faith. There exists no legal basis for the current situation to persist,
and the children are already showing signs of distress, emotional trauma, and are beginning to struggle academically.
The children need the Petitioner's stable, nurturing care during this difficult time, and they will soon lose all access to their Father who will be homless given the circumstances.
The Petitioner has been fighting for over a year to get back into his residence to no avail. The Respondent has refused to participate, and 
continues to prioritize her new relationship over the children. Notice would only spark more deceptive legal actions from the Respondent to try and subvert justice.M.2328 M.2328

Notice of Temporary EX-Parte TRO
2 messages
FUDSTOP <chuckdustin12@gmail.com> Fri, Mar 21, 2025 at 10:44 PM
To: Cooper Carter <coopercarter@majadmin.com>
Ms. Carter,
Pursuant to Tarrant County Local Rule 3.30(c)   , this letter provides notice that I intend to present an Emergency Ex
Parte Application for Temporary Restraining Order (TRO)  seeking immediate relief in the interest of my children’ s well-
being and to prevent irreparable harm to my property , family relationships, and ability to earn a living.
The TRO will NOT  request exclusive temporary use of the marital residence but that if your client has issue, she has
alternative housing and has used possession of the residence to damage my livelihood and restrict my parenting time.
The application will include verified evidence supporting the necessity of immediate relief, including:
Verified communications acknowledging my need for the home to work
Records of financial losses from displacement (Airbnb receipts, business losses, etc.)
Evidence of your client disposing of or concealing my personal property
Proof that the children have been left unsupervised overnight by your client on multiple occasions.
Documentation from the school showing excessive absences and academic concerns regarding Mara.
Text evidence between myself and the multiple AIRBNB hosts showcasing the difficulty faced in setting up
operations outside of the reliable setup of the house.Photographs and texts contradicting claims made in previous pleadings
Dental neglect of my youngest daughter (photos of untreated cavities)
Financial documents showing I paid all vehicle and rent obligations, contrary to your client’ s claims
Text messages between myself and the grandparents of your client showing we can be amicable during this
situation and put the children first.Photo evidence showing the only way I have to communicate with my daughters is via an online game, ROBLOX,
due to your client preventing communications.My criminal record showing that I have never been convicted of a violent crime.
The current temporary orders which are facially void and can be collaterally attacked in any court at any time.
Again, there is absolutely zero reason to have me barred from the residence and strip the children of their parents. It
contradicts the lodestone of the Family Code which is in the best interests of the children. 
This is the more logical solution. If we pursued this route in the beginning, we'd already be divorced and the children's
financial stability wouldn't have been sacrificed. There is no risk of danger. There is no risk of harm to the children. There
is only the possibility of recovery. That is in their best interests.
There is no legal reason your client has to want me out of the house other than just that. She cannot unilaterally decide
that I agree to everything and then do as she pleases with my personal belongings and neglect the children in multiple
areas.
Your argument that I agreed to the orders in place falls flat on its face for many reasons which will not be repeated here.
I am providing this notice strictly to comply with Local Rule 11(e) . I will proceed to present the application to the Court
without further delay  due to the nature of the harm and urgency involved.
If you wish to discuss these matters, I'm happy to do so - otherwise I will inform the court that you do not agree to the
orders upon submission.
This situation cannot continue, and the alternatives that are available must be pursued to uphold the best interests of the
children before any further damage to their well-being is sustained.
Respectfully,

Cooper,
Petitioner (your client) filed the original divorce petition in December 2023 in the 322nd District Court (Cause No. 322-
744263-23). In that petition, she alleged false claims of family violence and sought a waiver of the 60-day waiting
period for divorce, ostensibly to expedite temporary relief by labeling me as an abuser and claiming she had an active
order of protection against me at the time of filing . 
On February 1, 2024, a temporary orders hearing was held before an Associate Judge . The parties (through counsel)
announced an apparent agreement on temporary custody and other matters. The associate judge signed an “Associate
Judge’ s Report for T emporary Orders” , titled as “Agreed Temporary Orders.” Importantly, this report did not itself
constitute a signed court order; instead, it outlined the agreed terms and directed further action before any order would
be final. Specifically, the report stated that Respondent's attorney (Dan Bacalis) would prepare a formal temporary
orders document, which would be prepared from 20 days from the date of signing, which would have been February
22nd, 2024. It also required that both attorneys were to approve it to form within 5 days (have 5 days to approve
the order), and that if no agreement on form was reached, a motion to sign would need to be filed within 30 days .
The report noted that the parties’ personal approval was not required for entry of the order, implying the attorneys’ sign-off
or a court motion would suffice. No district judge signed an order at that time – the associate judge’s report was
essentially a recommendation  to be formalized in a written order.  
Immediately after the Feb 1 hearing, Respondent lost confidence in his attorney’ s actions and fired his attorney.
Believing that the “agreement” did not reflect the child’ s best interests or was entered under false pretenses (due to
Petitioner ’s unfounded allegations), Respondent promptly withdrew his consent  to the announced terms. On February
5, 2024, before any temporary order was signed by the court,  Respondent (now pro se) filed an Emergency Motion to
Reconsider and Vacate Temporary Orders . This motion put the court on notice that Respondent no longer consented  to
the supposed agreed terms and that he objected to any temporary order being entered as announced.  
Despite this, the reconsideration was denied and no findings were ever entered. In fact, the order explicitly ordered
Respondent to sign the orders to which he did not agree in violation of his own directives.
Texas law is clear that an associate judge’ s report or proposed order is not a final, enforceable court order
unless and until it is adopted and signed by the referring court.  Under the Family Code, an associate judge may
conduct hearings and recommend orders, but those recommendations remain subject to approval by the district court
judge.  Section 201.011 of the Texas Family Code provides that an associate judge’s report “may contain the associate
judge’s findings, conclusions, or recommendations and may be in the form of a proposed order”. In other words, the
associate judge’s report (even if titled “Temporary Orders”) is essentially a draft or advisory decision; it does not itself
carry the force of a court order until the proper procedures are completed.  
Family Code § 201.013 unambiguously outlines how and when an associate judge’s proposal becomes an order of the
court. If a party timely requests a de novo hearing by the referring judge, the associate judge’ s proposed order may be
enforced in the interim (except for certain matters) pending that hearing. However , if no timely request for a de novo
hearing is filed, the statute states that “the proposed order or judgment of the associate judge becomes the
order or judgment of the referring court only on the referring court’ s signing  the proposed order or judgment.”
Thus, absent a de novo appeal, an associate judge’ s recommendation must be signed by the district judge  to have any
legal effect. Until the judge signs it, it is merely a proposed  order , not an actual court order.  
Because the February 1, 2024 temporary orders were never signed or adopted by the court, Respondent was (and is)
under no legal obligation to follow them, and neither party could properly enforce those terms through contempt or other
remedies. A party cannot be held in contempt for violating a non-existent court order . Here, the “Agreed Temporary
Orders” are, at most, an agreement between the parties that was not entered as a judgment. When Respondent withdrew
his agreement (as discussed below), even that contractual underpinning fell apart.  The Family Code’s requirements were
not met, and thus the purported temporary orders are void ab initio  due to lack of rendition or entry by the referring
court.  
The stage is thus set for this Court to intervene, because as of now , there is no operative temporary order governing
the child’ s conservatorship or possession.   
The Purported Temporary Orders Are Void and Subject to Collateral Attack in This
SAPCR 4/12/25, 1:06 PM Gmail - Notice of Temporary EX-Parte TRO
https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ik=13839461f7&view=pt&search=all&permthid=thread-a:r5821386652075575501&simpl=msg-a:r579825187415709… 2/4M.2335 M.2335
M.2335 M.2335 M.2335 M.2335

Because the February 1, 2024 temporary orders were never properly entered as a court order (and would have been
invalid if entered without consent - which is clearly the case here), they are void and can be attacked in this proceeding.
Generally, once a court renders a final judgment, parties are constrained to challenge that judgment on direct appeal or in
the original case; collateral attacks  on final judgments are disfavored. However, only a void judgment is subject to
collateral attack in a separate proceeding. Browning v. Prostok, 165 S.W.3d 336, 346 (Tex. 2005)  (“Browning v.
Placke , 698 S.W.2d 362, 363  (Tex. 1985)”)
In this SAPCR, Respondent is effectively collaterally attacking  the temporary orders from the divorce case by asserting
their invalidity . Such a collateral challenge is permissible here because those orders are void. As the Texas Supreme
Court has explained, “Only a void judgment may be collaterally attacked.” Id.
Accordingly, Respondent asks this Court to formally declare  that the March 26, 2024 “Agreed Temporary Orders” (and
any interlocutory rulings associated with them) in Cause No. 322-744263-23 are void, of no effect, and not binding  on
the parties. This declaration will remove any doubt or argument by Petitioner that those terms still govern the parties’
rights. It will also foreclose any attempt to enforce or rely on those non-orders (for example, in claims of violation or in
arguing res judicata). The Court has the authority in equity and under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (T ex. Civ.
Prac. & Rem. Code chapter 37) to declare the rights and status of the parties vis-à-vis that prior proceeding – particularly
given that the SAPCR directly concerns the child who was also at issue in the divorce temporary orders. Granting such
relief is appropriate to prevent confusion and multiplicative litigation. Once the prior “orders” are declared void, this Court
can proceed to issue fresh temporary orders for the child without any conflict or cloud from the divorce case.  
In sum, the prior temporary orders are a legal nullity and this Court should treat them as such. The Court’s order declaring
them void will simply recognize the reality that, due to the procedural faults and lack of consent, those orders never had
legal existence. This clarification is critical to move forward in protecting the child’ s welfare, as discussed next.   
Immediate Emergency Relief Is Necessary to Protect the Child’s Best Interest 
Every day that passes without a valid temporary order is a day of potential harm or uncertainty for the child.  The
current situation – a divorce case stuck in limbo with no operative orders, and parents in dispute – is untenable for a
child’s well-being. The child has effectively been living under an informal or contested arrangement since February 2024.
Petitioner has acted as though she has primary custody under the (void) temporary orders, while Respondent has been
sidelined and denied the normal possession or decision-making that a proper order (or a true agreement) would have
provided him. This dynamic, fueled by Petitioner’s unproven allegations of family violence, has caused significant stress
and instability for the child. Respondent fears that Petitioner is leveraging the appearance of an order to restrict his
contact with the child and to make unilateral decisions that are not in the child’ s best interest. Meanwhile, the divorce
proceeding has not moved forward to a final resolution – over 12 months  have elapsed since the March hearing, with no
trial setting in sight. This stalemate directly af fects the child: there is no clear court-sanctioned framework for
conservatorship, visitation, or support, and your client has only introduced chaos into their lives.
This Court, now handling the SAPCR, has both the authority and the duty to step in and provide stability . Under T ex. Fam.
Code §  105.001, “the court may make a temporary order, including the modification of a prior temporary order, for
the safety and welfare of the child,” including orders for temporary conservatorship and possession.
The Family Code specifically empowers courts to act expeditiously to protect a child: if there is immediate danger to the
child’ s physical or emotional health, the court can even issue temporary orders without notice (such as a temporary
restraining order) to address the emergency. Here, Respondent asserts that the child’s emotional welfare is indeed in
jeopardy . The lack of a valid order has enabled Petitioner to marginalize Respondent’s role in the child’s life, purportedly
under the guise of the void temporary orders. Petitioner’s false accusations of violence – never tested or proven in court –
have created a pretext for her to limit Respondent’s access. Consequently, the child is being unjustly deprived of time and
a relationship with Respondent, who has been a loving father with no history of abuse. This scenario is precisely what
emergency temporary orders are designed to prevent. The Court should not allow a procedural quagmire to result in a
child effectively losing a parent or receiving inferior care.  
Most importantly, the “best interest of the child” is the paramount consideration in any conservatorship or
possession decision. See 153.002 TEX. F AM. CODE.
All Texas courts must ensure that their orders first and foremost serve the child’s best interest. By that standard,
continuing under the shadow of void orders and parental discord is plainly not in this child’ s best interest. Instead, the
child’s best interest calls for fresh, valid temporary orders that set forth clear, fair, and safe arrangements for custody and
visitation while the parents’  disputes are resolved. The Court should craft these orders based on current evidence and the
child’s needs – not based on an outdated and unconsented plan from February. The Family Code’s public policy (Tex.
Fam. Code § 153.001) favors frequent, continuing contact with fit parents and stable environments free of violence or
abuse. Here, Respondent is ready, willing, and able to care for the child and poses no danger, and he simply seeks a
normal custody schedule that allows the child to have both parents in his life. Petitioner ’s unsupported claims of family4/12/25, 1:06 PM Gmail - Notice of Temporary EX-Parte TRO

violence (made to gain a litigation advantage) should not dictate the child’ s reality any longer, especially since those
claims have not been substantiated in any court hearing.  
Why your consolidation motion and response are insufficient, and will fail, or be
met with mandamus if granted (after reconsideration)
 Normally, even without continuing exclusive  jurisdiction, a prior pending  suit would require the new suit to be consolidated
or abated (as discussed above with §  6.407 and dominant jurisdiction). The mother (divorce petitioner) could argue that
the original court “has jurisdiction” over the children by virtue of the pending divorce, so the SAPCR should not proceed
separately. However, the void nature of the prior temporary orders is a game-changer. If those orders are void, then
the original case has not effectively adjudicated anything regarding the children’s current custody or support. The SAPCR
petitioner can contend that because the prior orders are null, there is no valid existing order or active management of the
children’s case, and the new court is free to act in the children’s best interests. This is the EXACT argument made . In
effect, the argument is that the divorce case’s jurisdiction over the children lapsed into dormancy or “dormant jurisdiction”
due to your failure to prosecute the case.
It’s important to distinguish jurisdiction  from orders . The continuing jurisdiction doctrine  would typically prevent a
different court from issuing orders if a final order existed or if another court was actively handling the case. But here the
SAPCR is filed in the same county as the divorce. There is no risk of two different counties competing; it’s an internal
issue. The SAPCR ef fectively asks the  court to take up a new cause number and to recognize that the old cause has
stalled and its orders are void.  
EVEN IF the void argument fails, there is another nuance to this area of law . Despite the lack of a final order, the
pending divorce still technically invokes the court’ s jurisdiction over the children. Typically, the proper course is to revive or
dismiss  the dormant divorce, rather than maintain a wholly separate SAPCR on the side. Texas courts adhere to the
principle that the first suit filed (here, the divorce) should dominate; a later-filed suit concerning the same subject (the
children) can be abated to prevent conflicting rulings. In fact, in  In re Shifflet , for example, a party attempted parallel
litigation regarding child custody, and the court emphasized that modifications must be filed in the court with jurisdiction
over the original case
The only exception  to the one-court rule is narrow. Texas law does allow a court to lose dominant jurisdiction if the
party with the first suit proceeded in bad faith or the suit is not actively pursued. Both apply here. The first suit was
unquestionably brought in bad faith, as the declaration of an active protective order being in ef fect against the
Respondent was an intentional fabrication designed to provide your client with an advantage. Despite this, the
Texas legislature should have prevented the first hearing from ever happening, because 6.405b of the T exas Family
Code required your client to present the alleged order to the court BEFORE ANY HEARING. 
CONCLUSION 
Thus, the SAPCR is appropriately before the court, and the only argument you made in your Response fails. The court
denied my attempt to open this separate suit, requiring me to file a 17 page argument as to why the case should be
accepted, and then it was.
So your response effectively mirrors the first denial from the court,  which amounts to no response being filed at all.
It is clear you are not representing your client in a manner to uphold the law or the best interests of the children, but to
only appear when needed to obstruct the much needed justice that the children need and deserve.
This is my position.

Hello, 
This is Charles Dustin Myers, Petitioner in the above captioned cause, and I received an automated reply deferring me to
this email when originally reaching out to the Honorable Coordinator .
The original email's purpose was to inform the Honorable Coordinator that I had just received notification through the EFM
that the emergency ex-parte TRO had been accepted by the court.
I am following up to inquire about the status of the request.
I thank you for your attention to this urgent matter, and I will wait for further directive from the court to proceed accordingly.
As mentioned in the motion, the Respondent in this matter and her counsel of record have been duly notified of the relief
being sought and the motion itself, but have not responded to any attempts to communicate regarding this urgent matter .
Thank you and have a wonderful evening.

Ms. Wierzbicki, Mr. Carter,
Thank you for the update. However, I must respectfully object to the assertion that this is a mandatory consolidation.
Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 174(a), consolidation is discretionary and not automatic where doing so would cause
delay, injustice, or prejudice to a party. Additionally, the Texas Supreme Court in Curtis v. Gibbs, 511 S.W.2d 263 (Tex.
1974) expressly carved out exceptions to dominant jurisdiction where:
The original case was filed in bad faith,
The case isn't been prosecuted;
Equity and justice require an independent forum.
All three conditions are present here. The SAPCR was filed in good faith after the 322nd case became procedurally
stalled and legally defective—with no Notice of Remand, no evidentiary rulings on the children, and pending dispositive
motions including unopposed requests for dismissal. 
It would be prejudicial to the children to consolidate a case that had no ability to proceed.
Thank you.
Respectfully,
Charles Dustin Myers

Friends on other side,
The Emergency EX-PARTE TRO has been filed and accepted by the court and is awaiting the judge's review. 
If a hearing is required, I will CC Cooper in the email correspondence.
If a hearing is not required, I will serve each of you with a copy of the TRO and proposed order in accordance with the
rules no later than seven days prior to the hearing.
The TRO has the following provisions:
*Respondent is PROHIBITED from preventing Petitioner from entering the matrimonial residence located at 6641
Anne Ct, Watauga, TX 76148.
* Respondent is PROHIBITED from disturbing the peace of the minor children named in this suit.
*Petitioner and Respondent are PROHIBITED from acting without candor towards all members of the household
in the presence of the children.
*Respondent is PROHIBITED from bringing the children in the presence of DAMEN GAUL T KAZLAUSKAS.
* Respondent is PROHIBITED from taking the children outside of Tarrant County, Texas.
These provisions, if granted, will be in effect until a full hearing is held no later than 14 days after the order is signed by
the judge.
Once the notice of hearing is served on all parties, I will be filing a motion for pre-trial conference to discuss the Rule 12
motion filed and served last week to ensure those issues are resolved prior to trial. 
At the hearing, the relief I am seeking is to convert the provisions from the TRO into temporary injunctions which will be
the exact same but will ask for them to remain until further order of the court and reset the status quo to March 6, 2024,
which was the last peaceful time enjoyed by all parties prior to the Respondent's unlawful lockout.
If a continuance is needed in order to get your affairs in order for the Rule 12 conference, please reach out as I have no
problem signing an agreed continuance if more time is needed.
I am not seeking sanctions at this time.
If granted, I believe the preceding details suit the best interests of Mara and Caroline, preserves their emotional and
financial well-being, allows myself to repair the substantial damage caused from the prior thirteen months, promotes an
amicable co-parenting relationship, and most importantly upholds Texas Law in ensuring that children have continuous,
frequent access to both parents  and that parents are encouraged to work together during and after divorce because
doing so is in their best interests.
I'm not looking to punish, hurt, or ruin anyone. I'm simply looking to do what's best for the kids and start working together
to finish this so we can all move on with our lives.
If you have any suggestions, modifications, or alternative solutions, please feel free to reach out and let me know , or
schedule a time and place to meet in person that best meets your schedule.

Court staff,
Ms. Carter’s recent correspondence is improper for several reasons, and appears to be an attempt to delay or interfere
with proceedings in which she has otherwise failed to meaningfully participate in. The following reasons support this
statement:
1. An objection to consolidation is already on file and remains unopposed. It cites controlling Texas precedent. Any
suggestion that consolidation is agreed upon or inevitable is misleading. Instead, she should properly file with the court
why the consolidation is improper or at the very least argue against Petitioner's position.
2. Ms. Carter has not fulfilled her obligation under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 237a to file a Notice of Remand. Until
she does, she is prohibited from proceeding or filing anything in the 322nd District Court as they currently do not have
jurisdiction over this matter until this obligation is fulfilled.
3. Her authority to represent the Respondent remains under challenge pursuant to a Rule 12 motion filed September 20,
2024. No hearing has been held, no written statement of authority has been filed, and no ruling has been made. Until
resolved, Rule 12 bars her from participating in either proceeding.
4.Ms. Carter has not prosecuted the case in the 322nd District Court in over eight months. This inaction has prejudiced
the Petitioner and delayed resolution of urgent matters af fecting the children.
5. She has failed to file any objections, responsive pleadings, or legal arguments opposing the relief requested—including
the Emergency TRO now pending.
6. Rather than reaching out to Petitioner to resolve any scheduling conflict, Ms. Carter improperly attempted to influence
the court by email. This violates the spirit of cooperation required by the rules, particularly where her participation is
procedurally barred.
7. Ms. Carter’s conduct appears designed to delay relief and subvert the best interest of the children, despite her failure to
oppose the requested relief in any meaningful way.
8. She has been provided with full notice of the Emergency TRO, the proposed order, supporting exhibits, and the time
and location of presentment. She has no legal basis to subvert Petitioner's due process rights.
In summary, Ms. Carter has not provided anything of substance in either Court, has not prosecuted the case, has not
argued on behalf of her client, or followed proper procedure.
Simply labeling the opposition as pro se and claiming that the consolidation will be filed without disclosing the above facts
is dishonest and should not be permitted as it will only cause further unnecessary delays to the relief being sought without
any substance being provided.
Again, all of these points have been argued in both courts, and it is her duty as counsel to handle these matters in
accordance with Texas Law.
These matters should be handled between the parties - not attempt to influence court staf f after hours.
The reason we are here in the first place is due to the above unanswered facts. Ms. Carter has had ample time to file an
objection, response, or counter argument, but has chosen not to do so.
It would've been far more appropriate for Ms. Carter to have reached out to me directly to discuss scheduling conflicts.
Prior to the latest email, there was no indication Ms. Carter intended to participate at all despite being provided with all
relevant materials.3/29/25, 12:09 PM Gmail - ITIO MORGAN CHILDREN, CAUSE NO. 233-765358-25 CL-12105

Court staff,
Ms. Carter’s recent correspondence is improper for several reasons, and appears to be an attempt to delay or interfere
with proceedings in which she has otherwise failed to meaningfully participate in. The following reasons support this
statement:
1. An objection to consolidation is already on file and remains unopposed. It cites controlling Texas precedent. Any
suggestion that consolidation is agreed upon or inevitable is misleading. Instead, she should properly file with the court
why the consolidation is improper or at the very least argue against Petitioner's position.
2. Ms. Carter has not fulfilled her obligation under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 237a to file a Notice of Remand. Until
she does, she is prohibited from proceeding or filing anything in the 322nd District Court as they currently do not have
jurisdiction over this matter until this obligation is fulfilled.
3. Her authority to represent the Respondent remains under challenge pursuant to a Rule 12 motion filed September 20,
2024. No hearing has been held, no written statement of authority has been filed, and no ruling has been made. Until
resolved, Rule 12 bars her from participating in either proceeding.
4.Ms. Carter has not prosecuted the case in the 322nd District Court in over eight months. This inaction has prejudiced
the Petitioner and delayed resolution of urgent matters af fecting the children.
5. She has failed to file any objections, responsive pleadings, or legal arguments opposing the relief requested—including
the Emergency TRO now pending.
6. Rather than reaching out to Petitioner to resolve any scheduling conflict, Ms. Carter improperly attempted to influence
the court by email. This violates the spirit of cooperation required by the rules, particularly where her participation is
procedurally barred.
7. Ms. Carter’s conduct appears designed to delay relief and subvert the best interest of the children, despite her failure to
oppose the requested relief in any meaningful way.
8. She has been provided with full notice of the Emergency TRO, the proposed order, supporting exhibits, and the time
and location of presentment. She has no legal basis to subvert Petitioner's due process rights.
In summary, Ms. Carter has not provided anything of substance in either Court, has not prosecuted the case, has not

Good morning,
Mr. Myers appeared before me to schedule the hearing for the TRO; my apologies I did not realize this was that
same case.  We can go ahead and set the TRO with us, but most likely the case will be transferred prior to the
hearing date and the case needs to be transferred prior to that date.
Mr. Myers will be emailing with dates available for the hearing.
Thank you,

Cooper,
I've already objected.
You have no legal authority to do so until you address my objection filed and served to you.
Furthermore, you have not sent the Notice required by rule 237a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and have not
shown you authority to represent the Petitioner in this matter.
Finally, you claimed to have been retained in your individual capacity yet are claiming Marx Altman and Johnson is filing
pleadings on your behalf, and Roderick D. Marx is not a party in this suit nor has he made a formal appearance.
You're well aware of these obligations, and any order resulting from this motion will be challenged via the proper legal
proceedings.
You cannot continue to disregard the rules of procedure, fail to respond to motions or evidence served to you, and
continue to expect favors from the bench in leu of you performing your duties as a licensed attorneys.
You are put on notice that if any such motion is presented to the court in the face of the above facts or the unanswered
objection already served to you, I will move for your disqualification immediately and will provide the Texas OAG with your
information and detailed misconduct as well as the State Bar of Texas.
Further, you have not provided or served a copy of the proposed order which you intend to present, which is required.
This conversation will be filed and made apart of the official court record. 
Respectfully submitted,
Charles Myers
