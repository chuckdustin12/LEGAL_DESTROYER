Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, respectfully submits this notice of

ORDER and formally requests a certified copy of the docket sheet at the court’s earliest convenience. Respondent further requests that the Court take judicial notice of the lack of opposition and expedite ruling on this matter, and in support thereof, shows the following:

 1. On January 24, 2025, Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, filed a Motion to 
Dismiss, setting forth that Petitioner, by way of her attorney, COOPER L. CARTER, had 
abandoned the case in all but name. 
2. Now, on March 14, 2025, the record remains as still as a pond at dawn— untouched, 
undisturbed, and left to gather dust by the opposing side, with not so much as a word filed in response.  
3. Pursuant to Rule 165a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, any case not disposed of 
within the time standards promulgated by the S upreme Court may be put on the dismissal docket. 
This give s the court under the present circumstances the discretion to act.  
II. COUNSEL ’S INABILITY TO FILE AND IMPROPER EMAIL REGISTRATION  
 4. Beyond mere inaction, Petitioner faces a more fundamental obstacle —she lacks the 
ability to electronically file anything at all. Her registered e -filing credentials remain tied to an 
email address belonging to her prior employer, an entity with no involvem ent in these 
proceedings.  
5. As a result, Counsel ’s ability to prosecute this case is not only absent by choice but 
also by circumstance. Without proper access to the court’s electronic filing system, she cannot submit pleadings, motions, or responses in accordance with Texas filing requirements  – as 
evidence by her participation in the case thus far. See Exhibit 1  
6. This procedural defect is not some minor inconvenience —it renders Petitioner unable 
to engage in the litigation she initiated. The court, recognizing both her failure to prosecute and her procedural incapacity, has every reason to dismiss this case under R ule 165a .

 III. RULE 12 MOTION STILL  UNADDRESSED 
 7. On September 20th, 2024, Respondent, CHARLES  DUSTIN MYERS, moved for Rule 
12 against COOPER L. CARTER  challenging her authority. To date, no response has been filed, 
no authority has been proven, and this gives the court one more reason to either dismiss this case 
outright, grant summary judgement in favor of t he Respondent, or disqualify Ms. Carter for her 
inability to properly represent her client. 
IV . PROPOSED ORDER  
 8. Filed alongside this notice is a proposed order, prepared for the court’s immediate 
consideration and submission to the judge upon receipt by the clerk.  
9. The court holds in its hands multiple clear and just paths to resolution—dismissal for 
want of prosecution, summary judgment in Respondent’s favor, or disqualification of Petitioner’s counsel. Yet, despite the passage of time and the weight of unaddressed filings, no action has been taken. The absence of opposition, the procedural failures of Petitioner, and the unchallenged Rule 12 motion leave no reasonable basis for further delay.  
V . REQUEST FOR DOCKET SHEET  
 10. Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, has e mailed the dis trict clerk requesting  a 
docket sheet, but as is the case with everything else in this matter, no response or acknowledgement has been received  considering th ese requests.  
 11. Respondent hereby requests a copy of the docket sheet for cause numbe r 322- 744263-
23 at the court ’s earliest convenience . 
VI. CONCLUSION 
12. Justice is not served by silence, nor is due process upheld through inaction. The 
record stands as a testament to delay, neglect, and procedural failure—failures not of

4 
 Respondent, but of Petitioner, her counsel, and the system meant to ensure fair and timely 
resolution. 
13. The law provides remedies for such disregard. Rule 165a permits dismissal when a 
case stagnates beyond reason. Rule 12 demands proof of counsel’s authority, and when none is given, disqualification is required. Petitioner has failed to prosecute, failed to respond, and failed to even maintain the ability to file, leaving this case as little more than a ghost in the docket.  
14. The time for waiting has long passed. The court has before it everything needed to 
act—an unopposed Motion to Dismiss, an unanswered Rule 12 challenge, and a record devoid of 
meaningful participation from the Petitioner. Respondent has upheld his duty before this court at every turn; Petitioner has not. 
15. Therefore, Respondent respectfully requests that the court dismiss this case for want 
of prosecution, grant summary judgment in Respondent’s favor, or take any other appropriate action to resolve this matter without further delay . 
 Respectfully Submitted,
