      "text": "2 \n I. INTRODUCTION \nRelevant evidence is defined by Texas Rule of Evidence 401 as \"having any \ntendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of \nthe action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" Tex. R. Evid. 401; See Morale v. State , 557 S.W.3d 569, 573 (Tex. 2018).  \nThis Pre-Trial Motion in Limine , respectfully brought forth by CHARLES \nDUSTIN MYERS, Respondent, seeks to preclude the use of unsupported, general \nobjections as a tactic to hinder the presentation of valid arguments or evidence central to \nthe matter at hand, specifically in the context of the Joint Motion to Recuse  and pending \nRule 12 motion . The use of an unsubstantiated objection to \u201crelevance \u201d without a \nsupporting argument explaining how the evidence is irrelevant under Rule 401  of the \nTexas Rules of Evidence  serves to stifle the fair examination of pertinent facts and \nprevent the Court from fully considering matters critical to its determination.  \nII. STATEMENT OF  FACTS  \n1. The Rule 12 motion is specifically mentioned within the unaltered  and fully \nhyperlinked Joint Motion to Recuse originally filed and served on all parties of \nrecord via the Electronic Filing Manager as required by Tex. R. Civ. P. 21(a)(1)  on \nSeptember 20, 2024 , where  on page 14  it reads:  \n\u201cAttorney Cooper Carter\u2019s authority to represent the petitioner, currently \nbeing challenged through a Rule 12 motion, further deepens concerns about \nthe integrity and fairness of these proceedings .\u201d",

There exists no response to any pleadings filed by the Respondent in his own \ndefense in this matter, including a partial summary judgment filed on February \n28th, 2024, which was acknowledged by the court on March 14th, 2024.  \n \n4. There have been no pleadings served on the Respondent in this matter through the \nElectronic Filing Manager from Cooper L. Carter as required by Tex. R. Civ. P. \nRule 21(a)(1). \n \n5. Between April 14th, 2024, and September 30th, 2024, the Respondent sought relief \nvia a Petition for Writ of Mandamus in the Second Court of Appeals and the Texas Supreme Court.  \n \n6. The only effort to move the case forward during the appeal process was via a motion for pre -trial conference filed on April 24, 2024, on Cooper Carter\u2019s behalf \nby Roderick Marx, her former employer and founder of Marx Altman and Johson.  \n \n7. The Texas OAG attempted to intervene into the case on June 28\nth, 2024, was \npromptly objected to, and has since vanished. \n \n8. It wasn\u2019t until the denial of the Respondent\u2019s Mandamus petition in the Supreme \nCourt of Texas on August 30th, 2024, that the court  began attempting to  set a status \nconference informally through the Court Coordinator.  \n \n9. Cooper Carter\u2019s authority was challenged via a Rule 12 Motion on September 20, \n2024, and remains unresponded to.  \n \n10. The Respondent, representing himself pro -se, has not been labeled a vexatious \nlitigant. CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS respectfully moves the court  \n \nFor the reasons stated above, Respondent respectfully requests that the Court disallow \nany unsupported objections to the relevance of evidence by either party, unless the \nobjecting party provides a substantive argument or legal authority in support of thei r \nobjection. The Court should permit the admission of evidence concerning the undisputed",
