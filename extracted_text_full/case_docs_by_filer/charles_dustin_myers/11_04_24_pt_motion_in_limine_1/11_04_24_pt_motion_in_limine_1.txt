 I. INTRODUCTION 
Relevant evidence is defined by Texas Rule of Evidence 401 as "having any 
tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of 
the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence." Tex. R. Evid. 401; See Morale v. State , 557 S.W.3d 569, 573 (Tex. 2018).  
This Pre-Trial Motion in Limine , respectfully brought forth by CHARLES 
DUSTIN MYERS, Respondent, seeks to preclude the use of unsupported, general 
objections as a tactic to hinder the presentation of valid arguments or evidence central to 
the matter at hand, specifically in the context of the Joint Motion to Recuse  and pending 
Rule 12 motion . The use of an unsubstantiated objection to “relevance ” without a 
supporting argument explaining how the evidence is irrelevant under Rule 401  of the 
Texas Rules of Evidence  serves to stifle the fair examination of pertinent facts and 
prevent the Court from fully considering matters critical to its determination.  
II. STATEMENT OF  FACTS  
1. The Rule 12 motion is specifically mentioned within the unaltered  and fully 
hyperlinked Joint Motion to Recuse originally filed and served on all parties of 
record via the Electronic Filing Manager as required by Tex. R. Civ. P. 21(a)(1)  on 
September 20, 2024 , where  on page 14  it reads:  
“Attorney Cooper Carter’s authority to represent the petitioner, currently 
being challenged through a Rule 12 motion, further deepens concerns about 
the integrity and fairness of these proceedings .”

 2. There have not been any  pleadings filed on behalf of the Petitioner by her legal 
counsel in this matter.  
3. There exists no response to any pleadings filed by the Respondent in his own 
defense in this matter, including a partial summary judgment filed on February 
28th, 2024, which was acknowledged by the court on March 14th, 2024.  
 
4. There have been no pleadings served on the Respondent in this matter through the 
Electronic Filing Manager from Cooper L. Carter as required by Tex. R. Civ. P. 
Rule 21(a)(1). 
 
5. Between April 14th, 2024, and September 30th, 2024, the Respondent sought relief 
via a Petition for Writ of Mandamus in the Second Court of Appeals and the Texas Supreme Court.  
 
6. The only effort to move the case forward during the appeal process was via a motion for pre -trial conference filed on April 24, 2024, on Cooper Carter’s behalf 
by Roderick Marx, her former employer and founder of Marx Altman and Johson.  
 
7. The Texas OAG attempted to intervene into the case on June 28
th, 2024, was 
promptly objected to, and has since vanished. 
 
8. It wasn’t until the denial of the Respondent’s Mandamus petition in the Supreme 
Court of Texas on August 30th, 2024, that the court  began attempting to  set a status 
conference informally through the Court Coordinator.  
 
9. Cooper Carter’s authority was challenged via a Rule 12 Motion on September 20, 
2024, and remains unresponded to.  
 
10. The Respondent, representing himself pro -se, has not been labeled a vexatious 
litigant. CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS respectfully moves the court  
 
For the reasons stated above, Respondent respectfully requests that the Court disallow 
any unsupported objections to the relevance of evidence by either party, unless the 
objecting party provides a substantive argument or legal authority in support of thei r 
objection. The Court should permit the admission of evidence concerning the undisputed

4 
 facts outlined herein during the hearing scheduled for November 7, 2024, at 11:00 A.M. 
in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County.  
PRAYER 
Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, prays for the following relief from the 
Court in regard to this Motion in Limine:  
1. That this Pre -Trial Motion in Limine be granted if no timely response in 
opposition is filed by 11:00 A.M. on November 7, 2024.  
2. That the Court order all parties to refrain from making objections regarding the relevance of evidence without providing supporting legal arguments or citing 
applicable authority, ensuring that the hearing proceeds in a fair and equitable 
manner.  
3. Any other relief that the Court deems just and equitable under the 
circumstances.  
Respectfully submitted,
