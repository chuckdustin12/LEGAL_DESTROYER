IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
BEFORE THE 322ND COURT 
Morgan Michelle Myers, Plaintiff, 
vs. 
Charles Dustin Myers, Defendant. 
CAUSE NO. 322-744538-23 
MOTION FOR CONTINUANCE 
TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT: 
Comes now Charles Dustin Myers, Defendant in the above-entitled and numbered cause, respectfully 
requests that the Court grant a continuance in the protective order case, and as grounds therefore would 
show the following: 
1. Family Priorities During Holidays: The recent holiday season and the children's break from school 
have been my priority. Ensuring their stability and spending quality time with them has been of 
utmost importance, impacting my ability to prepare adequately for this case. 
2. Motion for Consolidation: I have recently filed a motion for consolidation to combine this case 
with two others due to their intertwined nature. This motion has been accepted by the court but 
not yet ruled upon by the judge. A decision on this matter could significantly impact the 
proceedings of this case. The relevant cases that are intertwined are cause numbers: 322-
744263-23 (DIVORCE) and JP01-23-E00102017 (EVICTION).

M.154 M.154 M.154 M.1543. Unfounded Claims in Eviction Suit and Protective Order: Both the eviction suit and the protective 
order claims are unfounded. The eviction suit lists the violation of the lease as "granddaughter 
divorced" and prematurely references the protective order as a secondary reason for eviction 
grounds. Additional time is needed to address these premature and baseless claims. There is no 
immediate danger to the Plaintiff, or the children -and has never been any incident of family 
violence that has occurred within our home. Attached is a copy of my criminal history obtained 
by the Texas Department of Public Safety that highlights my clean record. 
4. Time to appropriately answer the divorce: The parent case in the request to consolidate is the 
divorce, which I have yet to answer due to the concurrent proceedings (eviction suit and 
protective order) which were both filed due to the claims that I possess a history of family 
violence, waiving the 60-day period for service and making the timeframe unreasonable -
especially considering the lack of communications from the Plaintiffs-to formulate a plan that 
best suits our children's interests. 
5. Lack of Cooperation in Providing Lease Agreement: Despite requests, the Plaintiff has not 
provided a copy of the lease agreement necessary for my defense. More time is needed to 
acquire these critical documents, especially given the unlawful nature of the eviction. 
6. Potential for Amicable Resolution: Given more time to prepare and the pending decision on the 
consolidation of cases, there is a potential for a more amicable resolution to be reached. The 
intertwined nature of the cases suggests that a holistic approach to resolution may be more 
appropriate and beneficial for all parties involved. 
Considering the above reasons, continuity is necessary to ensure a fair and just resolution of this matter. 
I assure the Court that this request is not for the purpose of delay, but to allow for adequate preparation 
and the pursuit of justice. 
WHEREFORE PREMISES CONSIDERED, I, Charles Dustin Myers, respectfully request that the Court grant a 
continuance for the protective order case. 
Respectfully submitted,
