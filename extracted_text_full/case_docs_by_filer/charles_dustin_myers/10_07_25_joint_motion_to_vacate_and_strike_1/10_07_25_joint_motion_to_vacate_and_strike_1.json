      "text": "2 I. BACKGROUND\n1. On September 26, 2025, this Court entered two orders (attached as Exhibits 1 and 2)\npurporting to summarily deny two motions to recuse  (one titled \u201cMotion to Recuse Judge \nMunford\u201d and one titled \u201cMotion to Recuse Judge Kaitcer\u201d). In reality, Respondent filed only a single motion  on September 5, 2024 (file- stamped 11:25 A.M., attached as Exhibit 3) titled \n\u201cMotion to Recuse\u201d, which solely sought recusal of Judge James Munford. Nowhere in that motion was Associate Judge Jeff Kaitcer named or implicated. This misidentification mirrors the error that arose during prior recusal proceedings (leading to Texas Supreme Court case nos. 25-0426 and 25-0458), where the Court erroneously referenced two separate recusal motions (against both Judge Munford and Judge Kaitcer) when in fact only one motion (later amended) against Judge Munford  had been filed. \n2. These actions are not the actions of a n impartial Court. At the Regional level of the\njudiciary, on multiple occasions, we are putting our feelings regarding self -represented  litigants \nbefore the law  \u2013 even when his legal position is correct  and unopposed by any party. \n3. Perhaps even more concerning is that this Court ordered the other side to file a motionfor sanctions  when they did not oppose the motion  to recuse . The Court acts as if there isn \u2019t a \ncase docket that supports these facts and  continues to operate in a manner that exhibits clear \nfavoritism towards an incompetent and unethical attorney  who has not defended her client\u2019 s \ncrimes  as alleged . \n4. Finally, the opposing party actually filed the motion for sanctions  and requested $10,000\nin attorney\u2019 s fees without the required exhibits in a boilerplate motion which labeled \nRespondent\u2019 s motions as \u201cfrivolous\u201d despite not responding to a single one of them.  Exhibit 4.  \n5. There is no rational basis  for these actions, and these orders must be vacated immediately.",

The Court\u2019s orders issued on September 26, 2025, explicitly reference two motions. \nExhibit 1 references a motion titled  \u201cMotion to Recuse Associate Judge Kaitcer \u201d, while Exhibit 2 \nreferences a motion  titled \u201cMotion to  Recuse Judge Munford\u201d. However, Exhibit 3 clearly shows \nthe title of the motion is \u201cMotion to Recuse\u201d. The Court cannot deny motions which were never \nfiled, therefore the orders issued September 26, 2025, as to the order summarily denying the \nmotions to recuse must be vacated , and the original unadjudicated  motion should be considered \non its\u2019 merits. See Exhibit 3 (original motion filed with the Court). \nIII. GROUNDS TO  VACATE ORDE R DIRECTING T HE CASE TO PROCEED TO\nTRIAL P URSUANT TO TEX. CI V. PRAC. & REM. CO DE \u00a7 30.016 \n7.

This doe s not re quire a court orde r and \nis automatic by statute. The reasoning for this order  seems to be in r eference to Ju dge James \nMunford\u2019s \u201cOrder of Referr al\u201d where h e declined to recuse himself from the case and referred \nthe motion to the Regional Judge. Exhibit 5. When co mparing Exhibits 3  (the original Motion to \nRecuse) and Exhibit 5 (the order  of referral with attached motion to recuse), t hey are not the same \nthing. The referred motion, similar to the motions filed in th e prior two recusal proceedings, was \nmodified to remove the bookmarks and hyperlinks, ther eby affecting  its readability . \n8. The original motion, as filed, was not forwarded to the Regional Judge in its\u2019 original or \ncertified form, as required by law, in any of the r ecusal proceedings to date. \n9. For these reasons, the order di recting the case to  proceed to trial pursuant to Tex. Civ. \nPrac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 30.016 i s legally unnecessary and this order s hould be vacated.",

      "text": "4 \n IV. GROUNDS TO VACATE ORDER RE MANDATORY SANCTIONS FOR THE \nFILING OF  TERTIARY RECUSAL MOTION  \n \n10. The Court cannot order a party to file a motion for sanctions regarding 1) a motion that \nwas never filed  and 2) a motion that w as never opposed. The Court \u2019s own order highlights this  \nwhen it cites to Tex. Civ. Prac. &  Rem. Code\u00a7 30.016 (c), which states \u201c A judge hearing a \ntertiary recusal motion against another judge who denies the motion shall award reasonable and \nnecessary attorney's fees and costs to the party opposing the motion .\u201d (emphasis added)  \n11. Here, no such opposition has been fi led. In fact, no opposition has been filed in response \nto any of the Respondent \u2019s pleadings  throughout this case by the opposing party . \n12. By ordering a motion for sanctions to be filed , the Court is advocating on behalf of the \nPetitioner . The impartial  line of reasoning would have been for the Court to order that a \nresponse be filed by the opposing party , not that a motion for sanctions be filed regarding \nmotion s that do not  exist.  \n13. For the se reasons,  the order entitled \u201c ORDER RE MANDATORY SANCTIONS FOR \nTHE FILING OF  TERTIARY RECUSAL MOTION \u201d must also be vacated.  \nV. GROUNDS TO STRIKE PETITIONER \u2019S MOTION FOR SANCTIONS AND \nREQUEST FOR ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES  \n \n14. The most troubling aspect of this case is that the alleged attorney for Petitioner, COOPER  \n \nL. CARTER, continues to file fraudulent pleadings with this Court which  have no basis in law o r \n \nfact. Even if the non -existent motions did exist, COOPER L. CARTER \u2019s motion is facially  \n improper and her persistent incompetence is the crux of the issue  within this case.  \n \n15. This attorney had a pleading entitled \u201c Motion for Sanctions and Request for Attorney\u2019 s  \n \nFees\u201d filed on October 2, 2025, on her behalf by Roderick D. Marx, a n individual not named in",

      "text": "5 \n this lawsuit.  Cooper L. Carter has been under challenge pursuant to Rule 12 since September 20,  \n \n2024, and has continued to defraud the Courts on multiple occasions with boilerplate motions  \n \nthat have no factual basis . This latest motion is no different.  See Exhibit 6.  \n 16. In this mot ion, $10,000 in attorney\u2019s fees  are being request ed for \u201c several frivolous  \n \nmotions \u201d to which she never provided a response  to. This makes the motions  unopposed, not  \n \nfrivolous. Cooper L. Carter is under the misconception that  because  she holds a license to  \n practice law, she is free to violate it  simply because the Respondent is representing himself.  \n \n17. The record clearly shows that this attorney has not performed any duties normally  \n \nexpected of an attorney , and the $10,000 request for sanctions is yet another fraudulent  \n misrepresentation made by this attorney.  \n 18.  Notwithstanding the above, even if Cooper L. Carter had responded to the motion to  \n recuse and performed legal work to justify $10,000 sanctions, her motion remains facially  \n \ninvalid, as per the Court \u2019s order, exhibits were required to be attached. This further showcases  \n \nthat despite her status as a licensed attorney, her knowl edge of the law is lacking, and she  \n \nhas no right to declare motions as \u201c frivolous \u201d when she hasn\u2019 t provided any respons e. \n \n19. These are not accidental errors. This is intentional misrepresentation for personal  \n \nenrichment, a nd the impartial course of action for this Court would be to set a hearing on  \n \nthe motion to recuse  which was actually filed and served rather than advocate on behalf  of  \n the non-participating party . \n \n20. Cooper L. Carter should be required to file  a coherent response  to these facts.",

      "text": "6 \n VI. CONCLUSION  \n \n21.  The Court continues to adjudicate motions which were never filed, continues exhibit  \n \nFavori tism towards the P etitioner , and went so far as to orde r one side of the case to a sk for  \n Sanctions  on a motion that does  not exist and to which she did not respond to.  \n \n22. These errors are not superficial \u2013 they strike at the heart of due process and have made a  \n \nmockery of these proceedings. There is no evidence anyone is even reading the Respondent \u2019s  \n pleadings , yet feels entitled to label them as \u201cfrivolous \u201d. There is no evidence that the original  \n \nrecusal motion was ever referred to the Court.  \n \n23. There is clear mis conduct occurring in this case, a nd Respondent reserves the right to \n file a response to a coherent, fact-based motion for sanctions with the required exhibits once  \n a proper response is submitted. \n \n24. The Court cannot continue to reta liate, as it has done here, against the Respondent   \n \nwithout any legal basis. His self -represented  status does not permit the opposing attorne y to  \n \nconduct her  duties incompetently , and does not give the Court justification to intentionally  \n \nmisapply the law  and advocate  on behalf o f the other side.  \n \n25. Respondent \u2019s legal po sition is correct  absent any response or a coherent order , relief is  \n \nwarranted, and the orders issued  on September 26, 2025, must be va cated , the clear   \n \nfrivolous Motion for Sanctions and Request for Attorney\u2019 s Fees must be stricken , and a hearing  \n on the correct motion to recuse  should be scheduled at the earliest opportunity  for the reasons  \n \nstated above.",

INTRODUCTION  \n 1. There exists no excuse, nor any law or reasoning that could justify the events that have \ntranspired throughout this case. Respondent notes t hat this is the third recusal motion filed in this \nmatter, making it a tertiary recusal pursuant to Tex. Gov \u2019t. Code \u00a7 25.00256. The term includes \nany third or subsequent motion filed in the case by the same party, regardless of whether that \nmotion is filed against a different judge than the judge or judges against whom the previous \nmotions for recusal or disqualification were filed. \n 2. In practice, and pursuant to the statute, this gives Honorable James Munford the ability \nto move the case to final disposition as though a tertiary recusal motion had not been filed.  \nHowever, I urge this court to pay close attention for the forthcoming reasons: \n \n322-744263-23 FILED\nTARRANT COUNTY\n9/5/2025 11:25 AM\nTHOMAS A.

      "text": "3 \n II. RECUSAL STANDARDS AND PROCEDURE  \n 8. Texas appellate courts have consistently held that recusal is mandatory \u2014not \ndiscretionary \u2014when a judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned ( Ex parte Thuesen, \n546 S.W.3d 145 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017)). The test is whether a reasonable member of the public, \nknowing all the facts, would have a reasonable doubt about the judge\u2019s impartiality ( Rodriguez v. \nNewton, NUMBER 13-19-00309-CV (Tex. App. Jul 16, 2020);  In re Moore , NUMBER 13-19-\n00551-CV (Tex. App. Oct 30, 2019);  Johnson-Todd v. Morgan, NO. 09 -17-00168-CV, NO. 09-\n17-00194-CV (Tex. App. Dec 20, 2018);  Kniatt v. State , 239 S.W.3d 910 (Tex. App. 2007);  Sears \nv. Nueces County Sherriff Olivarez , 28 S.W.3d 611 (Tex. App. 2000)). This standard is applied \nregardless of whether actual bias exists; the appearance of bias is sufficient.  \n 9. When a recusal motion is filed, the judge must either recuse themselves or refer the \nmotion to another judge for decision; the challenged judge cannot unilaterally determine the sufficiency of the allegations ( De Leon v. Aguilar , 127 S.W.3d 1 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004)). \n 10. A federal lawsuit against a judge, particularly  one alleging conspiracy with a party in \na RICO action, creates an immediate and substantial conflict of interest that requires the judge\u2019s prompt recusal from presiding over this matter , because the judge\u2019s impartiality would \nreasonably be questioned under both constitutional and statutory standards. The integrity of the judicial process and the appearance of fairness demand recusal in such circumstances to preserve public confidence and due process , which has already been tain ted by these proceedings. \n 11.\n The Texas Constitution provides a foundational rule: no judge may preside over a \ncase in which they have an interest, or where there is a connection to the parties by affinity, consanguinity, or prior involvement as counsel (Tex. Const. art. 5 \u00a7 11). This constitutional mandate is echoed and elaborated in the Texas Government Code, which requires a judge to",

      "text": "4 \n recuse themselves and request assignment of another judge if they are disqualified or should \notherwise recuse ( Tex. Gov't. Code \u00a7 24.002). The Texas Government Code also provides \nmechanisms for parties to object to a judge\u2019s assignment in civil cases, including divorce, and mandates recusal upon timely objection ( Tex. Gov't. Code \u00a7 74.053).  \n 12. Administrative regulations reinforce these requirements, specifying that a judge is \nsubject to recusal or disqualification on the same grounds as set out in Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18b, and that motions to recuse must be made promptly and supported by admissible facts ( 1 Tex. Admin. Code \u00a7 155.152).  \n 13. The law is clear that the appearance of impropriety is as damaging as actual \nimpropriety. The Code of Judicial Conduct and the Texas Supreme Court have emphasized that judges must avoid situations where their impartiality might reasonably be questioned, as  public \nconfidence in the judiciary depends on the perception of fairness and neutrality (State v. Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft , 692 S.W.3d 467 (Tex. 2022);  In re Moore , NUMBER 13-19-\n00551-CV (Tex. App. Oct 30, 2019)).  15. Allegations of conspiracy under RICO are not mere accusations of bias or error; they \nare claims of criminal conduct and collusion with a party. This elevates the conflict of interest to an extraordinary level, making it virtually impossible for the judge t o preside without \nundermining the legitimacy of the proceedings. The public, and the parties, would have every reason to doubt the judge\u2019s impartiality, and the law requires recusal in such circumstances (Rodriguez v. Cantu (In re Rodriguez ), NUMBER 13-19-00230-CV, NUMBER 13- 19-00254-CV \n(Tex. App. Jun 25, 2019);  Johnson-Todd v. Morgan, NO. 09-17-00168-CV, NO. 09-17 -00194-CV \n(Tex. App. Dec 20, 2018)).  16.

      "text": "5 \n III. GROUNDS FOR RECUSAL  \nA. WIRE FRAUD  \n 8. On October 7, 2024, Respondent filed a joint motion to recuse District Judge James \nMunford and Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer through the electronic filing manager, serving all \nparties with one hyperlinked document containing all exhibits and notarized af fidavits (DKT NO. \n227). This recusal was filed in good faith after all appellate efforts were denied without \nexplanation. See Cause No. 24-0395.  \n 9. On October 8, 2024, at 4:43\u2009PM , correspondence was received  from Court Coordinator \nLindsey Baker regarding an  order of referral  and ruling letter transmitted by Di strict Judge James \nMunford to Regional Presiding Judge David L. Evans, declining to recuse himself  from this \nmatter  (DKT NOS. 228 -229). This emai l contained an unoriginal, modified version of the  joint \nmotion to recuse submitted to re:Search Texas  by the Respondent, and was missing the exhi bits \nand the affidavit.   \n 10. By CC\u2019ing this email to  coopercarter@majadmin.com  on October 8, 2024, District \nJudge James Munford, through his court coordinator, relied  on interstate wire communications  \nbecause majadmin.com  can be traced to the IP address 74.208.236.18, w hich IP Geolocation \nplaces in Kansas City, at coordinates 39.0997,-94.5786. Combined with the intentional alteration \nof the pleading to withhold material exhibits/affidavit  to influence the recusal outcome, the \ntransmission constitutes wire fraud  under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, thereby supplying a RICO predicate \nact under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1), committed by both Lindsey Baker and District Judge James \nMunford. At minimum, these facts plausibly allege the interstate-wire  and fraud elements  of this \nclaim  are supported by admissible evidence, that if true, would warrant his immediate recusal, \nand no further involvement from the Court Coordinator absent any swift corrective action.",

On October 10, 2024, court coordinator Lindsey Baker transmitted a n \u201cAmended \nOrder of Referral \u201d at 11:17\u2009AM  and a  second judge \u2019s ruling lett er. (DKT 232, 233) This \ntransmission relied on the same interstate wires mentioned above.  \n 12. The original motion was on ce again modified, this time split into three separate files \n\u201cdue to the size of the motion \u201d which wa s well under the 35mb li mit allotted  from the efile Texas \nplatform , with hyperli nks removed, affecting its \u2019 readability . \n 13. When Respondent pointed these issues  out, Baker confirmed the pleading had been e -\nfiled and the full document was in the court's possession (DKT NOS. 230-231 see Exhibits ) \nshowing that there was no plausible re ason to modify them.  \nC. FAILURE TO FOLLOW MANDATORY RECUSAL PROCEDURES  \n 14. The primary legislative and regulatory authorities governing the handling of recusal \nmotions in Texas are Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a and various provisions of the Texas \nGovernment Code, including sections 25.00256, 29.055, and 74.059(c)(3).  \n 15. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a  sets out the exclusive procedure for recusal or \ndisqualification  of judges in civil cases. Upon the filing of a recusal motion, the rule requires the \nrespondent judge, within three business days, to either recuse themselves or refer the motion to the regional presiding judge. The rule further mandates that the judge mus t take no further action \nin the case until the motion is resolved, except for good cause stated in writing or on the record.  \n 16. Texas Government Code \u00a7 25.00256 (and related provisions such as \u00a7 29.055 and \u00a7 \n74.059(c)(3)) reinforce these requirements, specifying that the judge must forward the motion and all related documents in their original form or as certified copies to the presiding judge, and may not take f urther action in the case until the recusal motion is resolved.",

Here , modifie d versions were transmitted , notably missing critical elements such as \nthe notarized affidavit and exhibits showing a long list of misconduct that remains unaddressed \nto this day.  Notwith standing the federal allegations above, there is a continuous pattern showing \nthat the law is being willfully disregarded by these individuals, and enabled by the Regional \nPresidin g Judge, who has permitted ruling s on non-existent motions, and the continued \ninvolvement of Baker despite clear ambiguities surrounding the prior two recusal proceedings.  \n 18. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a  and Texas Government Code \u00a7 29.055 both require \nthe forwarding of the motion and all related documents in their original or certified form. The use \nof the term \u201call\u201d and the requirement for original or certified copies preclude any alteration, omission, or selective transmission. This is f urther reinforced by case law, which consistently \nholds that the judge\u2019s only permissible actions are recusal or referral, and that any other action\u2014including any manipulation of the motion or its exhibits \u2014is outside the scope of the judge\u2019s \nauthority (In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex.

The ethical consequences of the allegations are significant. The Texas Code of \nJudicial Conduct requires judges to comply with the law and maintain professional competence. \nIn In re Inquiry Concerning Honorable Bonnie Rangel  (677 S.W.3d 918, Tex. 2023), the Texas \nSupreme Court publicly admonished a judge for filing a response to a recusal motion, which is \nexpressly prohibited by Rule 18a. The Court found that this single act demonstrated a lack of \ncompetence in the law and a failure to compl y with legal requirements, violating Canons 2A and \n3B(2).",

By analogy, in this case,  a staff member who serves at the pleasure of the Judge\nfacing recusal was permitted to  transmit  non-original copies a government document through the \nuse of interstate wires  when the law clearly prohibits such behavior. \n21. Furthermore, these actions are not isolated but build  upon a growing pattern of\nmisconduct in furtherance of a broader scheme initiated by Petitioner Morgan Michelle Myers.  \nV. PURSUIT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS\n22. The actions alleged herein are part of a larger, broader scheme to def raud the\nRespondent of his business and property, and this Recusal serves as both a notice to any \nindividual reading this brief that the law is not optional.

CONCLUSION\n24. For these reasons, Judge James Munford should be immediately r ecused , or in the\nalternative, correct the mistakes that have remained unaddressed for two years and remain unopposed on the face of the record.  \n25. T\nhe re cord is clear: this is a one sided case, with a one sided outcome, and despite\nhaving every reason to correct the errors in the face of no opposition, this Court has chosen to \ndisregard the law, ethical standards, and has committed several predicate acts in the process which will be outlined in more detail if the subsequent federal action must be brought.",

INTRODUCTION \n1. There exists no excuse, nor any law or reasoning that could justify the events that have \ntranspired throughout this case. Respondent notes that this is the third recusal motion filed in this \nmatter, making it a tertiary recusal pursuant to Tex. Gov't. Code\u00a7 25.00256. The term includes \nany third or subsequent motion filed in the case by the same party, regardless of whether that \nmotion is filed against a different judge than the judge or judges against whom the previous \nmotions for recusal or disqualification were filed. \n2. In practice, and pursuant to the statute, this gives Honorable James Munford the ability \nto move the case to final disposition as though a tertiary recusal motion had not been filed. \nHowever, I urge this court to pay close attention for the forthcoming reasons: \n1",

      "text": "II. RECUSAL STANDARDS AND PROCEDURE \n8. Texas appellate courts have consistently held that recusal is mandatory-not \ndiscretionary-when a judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned (Ex parte Thuesen, \n546 S.W.3d 145 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017)). The test is whether a reasonable member of the public, \nknowing all the facts, would have a reasonable doubt about the judge's impartiality (Rodriguez v. \nNewton, NUMBER 13-19-00309-CV (Tex. App. Jul 16, 2020); In re Moore, NUMBER 13-19-\n00551-CV (Tex. App. Oct 30, 2019); Johnson-Todd v. Morgan, NO. 09-17-00168-CV, NO. 09-\n17-00194-CV (Tex. App. Dec 20, 2018); Kniatt v. State, 239 S.W.3d 910 (Tex. App. 2007); Sears \nI \nv. Nueces County SherriffOlivarez, 28 S.W.3d 611 (Tex. App. 2000)). This standard is applied \nregardless of whether actual bias exists; the appearance of bias is sufficient. \n9. When a recusal motion is filed, the judge must either recuse themselves or refer the \nmotion to another judge for decision; the challenged judge cannot unilaterally determine the \nsufficiency of the allegations (De Leon v. Aguilar, 127 S.W.3d 1 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004)). \n10. A federal lawsuit against a judge, particularly one alleging conspiracy with a party in \na RICO action, creates an immediate and substantial conflict of interest that requires the judge's \nprompt recusal from presiding over this matter, because the judge's impartiality would \nreasonably be questioned under both constitutional and statutory standards. The integrity of the \njudicial process and the appearance of fairness demand recusal in such circumstances to preserve \npublic confidence and due process, which has already been tainted by these proceedings. \n11. The Texas Constitution provides a foundational rule: no judge may preside over a \ncase in which they have an interest, or where there is a connection to the parties by affinity, \nconsanguinity, or prior involvement as counsel (Tex. Const. art. 5 \u00a7 11 ). This constitutional \nmandate is echoed and elaborated in the Texas Government Code, which requires a judge to \n3",

      "text": "recuse themselves and request assignment of another judge if they are disqualified or should \notherwise recuse (Tex. Gov't. Code \u00a7 24.002). The Texas Government Code also provides \nmechanisms for parties to object to a judge's assignment in civil cases, including divorce, and \nmandates recusal upon timely objection (Tex. Gov't. Code\u00a7 74.053). \n12. Administrative regulations reinforce these requirements, specifying that a judge is \nsubject to recusal or disqualification on the same grounds as set out in Texas Rule of Civil \nProcedure 18b, and that motions to recuse must be made promptly and supported by admissible \nfacts (1 Tex. Admin. Code\u00a7 155.152). \n13. The law is clear that the appearance of impropriety is as damaging as actual \nimpropriety. The Code of Judicial Conduct and the Texas Supreme Court have emphasized that \njudges must avoid situations where their impartiality might reasonably be questioned, as public \nconfidence in the judiciary depends on the perception of fairness and neutrality (State v. \nVolkswagen Aktiengesellschaft, 692 S. W.3d 467 (Tex. 2022); In re Moore, NUMBER 13-19-\n00551-CV (Tex. App. Oct 30, 2019)). \n15. Allegations of conspiracy under RICO are not mere accusations of bias or error; they \nare claims of criminal conduct and collusion with a party. This elevates the conflict of interest to \nan extraordinary level, making it virtually impossible for the judge to preside without \nundermining the legitimacy of the proceedings. The public, and the parties, would have every \nreason to doubt the judge's impartiality, and the law requires recusal in such circumstances \n(Rodriguez v. Cantu (In re Rodriguez), NUMBER 13-19-00230-CV, NUMBER 13-19-00254-CV \n(Tex. App. Jun 25, 2019); Johnson-Toddv. Morgan, NO. 09-17-00168-CV, NO. 09-17-00194-CV \n(Tex. App. Dec 20, 2018)). \n16. Absent corrective action, immediate recusal is warranted, supported by the following: \n4",

      "text": "III. GROUNDS FOR RECUSAL \nA. WIRE FRAUD \n8. On October 7, 2024, Respondent filed a joint motion to recuse District Judge James \nMunford and Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer through the electronic filing manager, serving all \nparties with one hyperlinked document containing all exhibits and notarized affidavits (DKT NO. \n227). This recusal was filed in good faith after all appellate efforts were denied without \nexplanation. See Cause No. 24-0395. \n9. On October 8, 2024, at 4:43 PM, correspondence was received from Court Coordinator \nLindsey Baker regarding an order of referral and ruling letter transmitted by District Judge James \nMunford to Regional Presiding Judge David L. Evans, declining to recuse himself from this \nmatter (DKT NOS. 228-229). This email contained an unoriginal, modified version of the joint \nmotion to recuse submitted to re:Search Texas by the Respondent, and was missing the exhibits \nand the affidavit. \n10. By CC'ing this email to coopercarter@majadmin.com on October 8, 2024, District \nJudge James Munford, through his court coordinator, relied on interstate wire communications \nbecause majadmin.com can be traced to the IP address 74.208.236.18, which IP Geolocation \nplaces in Kansas City, at coordinates 39.0997,-94.5786. Combined with the intentional alteration \nof the pleading to withhold material exhibits/affidavit to influence the recusal outcome, the \ntransmission constitutes wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, thereby supplying a RICO predicate \nact under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1), committed by both Lindsey Baker and District Judge James \nMunford. At minimum, these facts plausibly allege the interstate-wire and fraud elements of this \nclaim are supported by admissible evidence, that if true, would warrant his immediate recusal, \nand no further involvement from the Court Coordinator absent any swift corrective action. \n5",

      "text": "B. WIRE FRAUD -COUNT TWO \n11. On October 10, 2024, court coordinator Lindsey Baker transmitted an \"Amended \nOrder of Referral\" at 11: 17 AM and a second judge's ruling letter. (DKT 232, 233) This \ntransmission relied on the same interstate wires mentioned above. \n12. The original motion was once again modified, this time split into three separate files \n\"due to the size of the motion\" which was well under the 35mb limit allotted from the efile Texas \nplatform, with hyperlinks removed, affecting its' readability. \n13. When Respondent pointed these issues out, Baker confirmed the pleading had been e\u00ad\nfiled and the full document was in the court's possession (DKT NOS. 230-231 see Exhibits) \nshowing that there was no plausible reason to modify them. \nC. FAILURE TO FOLLOW MANDATORY RECUSAL PROCEDURES \n14. The primary legislative and regulatory authorities governing the handling of recusal \nmotions in Texas are Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a and various provisions of the Texas \nGovernment Code, including sections 25.00256, 29.055, and 74.059(c)(3). \n15. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a sets out the exclusive procedure for recusal or \ndisqualification of judges in civil cases. Upon the filing of a recusal motion, the rule requires the \nrespondent judge, within three business days, to either recuse themselves or refer the motion to \nthe regional presiding judge. The rule further mandates that the judge must take no further action \nin the case until the motion is resolved, except for good cause stated in writing or on the record. \n16. Texas Government Code\u00a7 25.00256 (and related provisions such as\u00a7 29.055 and\u00a7 \n74.059(c)(3)) reinforce these requirements, specifying that the judge must forward the motion \nand all related documents in their original form or as certified copies to the presiding judge, and \nmay not take further action in the case until the recusal motion is resolved. \n6",

Here, modified versions were transmitted, notably missing critical elements such as \nthe notarized affidavit and exhibits showing a long list of misconduct that remains unaddressed \nto this day. Notwithstanding the federal allegations above, there is a continuous pattern showing \nthat the law is being willfully disregarded by these individuals, and enabled by the Regional \nPresiding Judge, who has permitted rulings on non-existent motions, and the continued \ninvolvement of Baker despite clear ambiguities surrounding the prior two recusal proceedings. \n18. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a and Texas Government Code\u00a7 29.055 both require \nthe forwarding of the motion and all related documents in their original or certified form. The use \nof the term \"all\" and the requirement for original or certified copies preclude any alteration, \nomission, or selective transmission. This is further reinforced by case law, which consistently \nholds that the judge's only permissible actions \u00b7are recusal or referral, and that any other action\u00ad\nincluding any manipulation of the motion or its exhibits-is outside the scope of the judge's \nauthority (In re Gold, 04-25-00085-CV (Tex. App. May 07, 2025); In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d \n858 (Tex. App. 2006); Carson v. Gomez, 841 S.W.2d 491 (Tex. App. 1992)). \nIV.ETHICS \n19. The ethical consequences of the allegations are significant. The Texas Code of \nJudicial Conduct requires judges to comply with the law and maintain professional competence. \nIn In re Inquiry Concerning Honorable Bonnie Rangel (677 S.W.3d 918, Tex. 2023), the Texas \nSupreme Court publicly admonished a judge for filing a response to a recusal moti_on, which is \nexpressly prohibited by Rule 18a. The Court found that this single act demonstrated a lack of \ncompetence in the law and a failure to comply with legal requirements, violating Canons 2A and \n3B(2). \n7",

By analogy, in this case, a staff member who serves at the pleasure of the Judge \nfacing recusal was permitted to transmit non-original copies a government document through the \nuse of interstate wires when the law clearly prohibits such behavior. \n21. Furthermore, these actions are not isolated but build upon a growing pattern of \nmisconduct in furtherance of a broader scheme initiated by Petitioner Morgan Michelle Myers. \nV. PURSUIT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS \n22. The actions alleged herein are part of a larger, broader scheme to defraud the \nRespondent of his business and property, and this Recusal serves as both a notice to any \nindividual reading this brief that the law is not optional. Whether a judge, an attorney, a clerk, or \na coordinator -the law is not below you. \n23.
