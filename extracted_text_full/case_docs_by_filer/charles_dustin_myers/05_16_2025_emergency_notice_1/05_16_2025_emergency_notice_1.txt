SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS
BLAKE A. HAWTHORNE, CLERKM.3502 M.3502
M.3502 M.3502 M.3502 M.3502

2 
 TO THE HONORABLE BLAKE A. HAWTHORNE : 
Pursuant to Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.6, Relator Charles 
Dustin Myers respectfully submits this emergency notice and 
communication regarding the pending emergency motion for stay , filed on 
May 1, 2025. That motion specifically requested a decision by the close of business on May 16, 2025, due to the time- sensitive and irreparable nature 
of the harm at issue. 
As of today’s close of business, Relator will be foreclosed from any 
contact with his children for the foreseeable future, as the temporary housing 
arrangement that enabled visitation has expired. No ruling has issued, and no response has been filed by any adverse party—despite timely and proper 
service of the emergency motion.  
This notice is respectfully provided as a formal communication under 
Rule 9.6, to ensure the Court is apprised of the imminent and ongoing 
irreparable harm, and the lack of opposition to the emergency relief sought.  
Time lost between a parent and child can never be restored. Each 
passing day without relief—or any explanation for the lack thereof—deepens the injustice already before this Court. Relator respectfully pleads for the Court to exercise emergency consideration pursuant to Texas Rules of M.3503 M.3503
M.3503 M.3503 M.3503 M.3503

3 
 Appellate Procedure 10.3(a)(3) and 52.10(b) and respectfully clarifies that 
the motion was filed as a request for emergency relief under those rules.  
 
Respectfully submitted,  
 
/s/ Charles Dustin Myers
