HAWTHORNE : \nPursuant to Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.6, Relator Charles \nDustin Myers respectfully submits this emergency notice and \ncommunication regarding the pending emergency motion for stay , filed on \nMay 1, 2025. That motion specifically requested a decision by the close of business on May 16, 2025, due to the time- sensitive and irreparable nature \nof the harm at issue. \nAs of today\u2019s close of business, Relator will be foreclosed from any \ncontact with his children for the foreseeable future, as the temporary housing \narrangement that enabled visitation has expired. No ruling has issued, and no response has been filed by any adverse party\u2014despite timely and proper \nservice of the emergency motion.  \nThis notice is respectfully provided as a formal communication under \nRule 9.6, to ensure the Court is apprised of the imminent and ongoing \nirreparable harm, and the lack of opposition to the emergency relief sought.  \nTime lost between a parent and child can never be restored. Each \npassing day without relief\u2014or any explanation for the lack thereof\u2014deepens the injustice already before this Court. Relator respectfully pleads for the Court to exercise emergency consideration pursuant to Texas Rules of M.3503 M.3503\nM.3503 M.3503 M.3503 M.3503",
