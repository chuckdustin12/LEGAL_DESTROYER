On December 14th, 2023, at 3:29 A.M., you began messaging Morgan Michelle Myers. You sent a total of 92 text\nmessages  throughout the day, which totals more than all messages exchanged for the prior two years. \n2. On December 14th, 2023, Morgan attempted to get an emergency ex-parte order of protection under your directive\nwhen no emergency situation existed.\n3. When this attempt didn't work, you then devised a scheme where you invited Morgan to stay at your residence located\nat 6100 Copan Ct., Yukon, Oklahoma, over the weekend of December 15, 2023.\n4. On December 15, 2023, you reached out to me using your cellular phone number 940-312-3434, and claimed that \"\n[you] want to help both of us\" regarding a recent divorce announcement made by Morgan on December 1st, 2023, and\nasked for me to call you. I replied that \"I wanted to fix this more than anything in the world\" and called you using my\ncellular phone number 817-507-6562.\n5. Directly following that phone call, you directed Morgan to transfer $1,576 from our joint marital bank account to your\nPayPal account with the intent to hide the final destination of the funds and conceal Morgan's bank account information.\nBank statements and text messages confirm this to be true.\n6. On December 16, 2023, I was notified that our bank account was overdrawn by $-800 the weekend before Christmas,\nand I texted you and requested the funds be returned, informing you that the funds were for bills and for the girls'\nChristmas presents.\n7. Rather than return the funds, you decided to unveil the true intention behind why you wanted Morgan to visit your\nresidence - which by your own words - was to \"help with the paperwork\" and that I was \"getting divorced\", a stark\ncontradiction to your initial claim of \"wanting to help both of us.\"\n8. While at your domicile, you assisted Morgan in acquiring a second phone, a can of pepper-spray mace, and confirmed\nvia text message that \"the money is in her account that you said was hers.\"\n9. You then proceeded to assist Morgan in preparing a statement of inability to af ford court costs, an original petition for\ndivorce, and through discovery it will be determined if you assisted in the protective order as well.\n10. The statement of inability to afford court costs was knowingly fraudulent, as it clearly misrepresented Morgan's\nfinancial obligations. Furthermore, considering you and Morgan both admit via text message evidence that you transferred\nmoney to her account, the deliberate misrepresentation of Morgan's financial status will be apparent when I present my\npayment history showing that I was responsible for the family finances leading up to the divorce announcement.3/10/25, 4:43 PM Gmail - Your Only Settlement Offer\nhttps://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ik=13839461f7&view=pt&search=all&permmsgid=msg-a:r-7413092481712777159&simpl=msg-a:r-74130924817127\u2026 1/3M.1759 M.1759\nM.1759 M.1759 M.1759 M.1759M Gmail",

      "text": "11. The original petition for divorce, also fraudulent, was filed under oath claiming financial indigency. Furthermore, the 60-\nday waiting period for divorce was waived due to the claim that an active order of protection was already in ef fect and that\nthe order had found family violence occurred during the marriage. You and Morgan both knew this statement was\nmaterially false, and proceeded to present it to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant county alongside the statement of\ninability to afford court costs on December 18, 2023.\n12. On December 17, 2023, I was served an eviction notice by Margie Evonne Wilson claiming a protective order had\nbeen filed against me, which didn't happen until December 22nd, 2023.\n13. Once filed, you then proceeded to text me and claim to be Morgan's legal representative, referring to her as \"[your]\nclient\" on December 19, 2023. You then proceeded to claim that \"you have never lied to me\", \"lets get the decree written\nup and move on with our lives\" showing your clear involvement in my marital af fairs you had no business meddling in.\n14. On December 22, 2023, Morgan filed for another protective order despite claiming to already have one in ef fect in the\ndivorce petition. Text and image evidence will show Morgan at the home that evening taking care of the children with me,\nlaughing and playing - clearly in no emergency.\n15. These fraudulent documents were relied upon by the court when I was unlawfully removed from the residence located\nat 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, TX 76148 on January 16, 2024.\n16. You proceeded to mock and harass me throughout my attempts at seeking relief in the second court of appeals,\nshowing malicious intent.\n17. You welcome this lawsuit against you as text message evidence will clearly show.\n18. Your latest threat in December of 2024, where you stated \"When this is over, you get to deal with me.\" showcases\nyour disregard for your actions and further showcases malicious intent.\nHere's the reality:\n1. You have caused significant emotional and psychological damage to my children by playing a part in my abrupt removal\nfrom their lives.\n2. As originally pointed out, you have helped Morgan conceal a marital affair between herself and Damen Kazlauskas, a\nthird party outside of the marriage that she exchanged over 6,500 text messages with leading up to the divorce.\n3. My children are now being raised by Meme and Papaw, not their parents, and this is due to your carelessness.\n4. You have devastated my business operations, costing me over $100,000 in damages and future business opportunity\nlosses from being unable to work in a stable home environment with reliable internet. \n5. My children are now being medically neglected by Morgan, Mara is starting to struggle in school, and your criminal\nhistory showcases this behavior as a character flaw rather than \"trying to protect someone\" as you have previously\nclaimed.\nIf you think you have a defense for the above actions, simply do not reply , and I look forward to hearing it in court. This is\nyour only opportunity to settle this outside of court , or I will be pursuing damages to the full extent that the law\npermits, and will be requesting a bifurcated jury trial for punitive damages to deter similar behavior in the future.\nThe case has already been established in the Western District of Oklahoma and is awaiting my request for service, which\nwill be submitted on Thursday, March 13th, 2025, at 1:00 P.M. CST if you do not accept the following terms:\n 1. You will send via PayPal the $1,576 you converted on December 15, 2023 by the deadline mentioned above.\n2.  You will inform Morgan of the severity of the actions you both have committed and restore stability to my\nchildren's lives and my life by taking the first step in doing the right thing and have her call me on my cellular\nphone number at 817-546-3693 to have a real conversation about how we are going to proceed.\n3. You will stop interfering in my divorce matter moving forward, and will return to being the loving, caring Dan Dan\nthat my daughters love and appreciate instead of furthering Morgan's conspiracy to conceal her marital af fair.3/10/25, 4:43 PM Gmail - Your Only Settlement Offer\nhttps://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ik=13839461f7&view=pt&search=all&permmsgid=msg-a:r-7413092481712777159&simpl=msg-a:r-74130924817127\u2026 2/3M.1760 M.1760\nM.1760 M.1760 M.1760 M.1760",

      "text": "That's it dan. That's all I'm asking of you. I'm asking you to step up, be a man, and do the right thing, or face the\nconsequences. I'm giving you this opportunity because I told the court that I would, and despite everything that's\nhappened, I am able to forgive so long as you meet me halfway.\nThis is me meeting you halfway.\nAgain, do not reply to this email. I will know if you accept the terms without the necessity of a response. I am not\ninterested in having a conversation with you. I am only interested in doing what's best for my children - and the situation\nyou have helped create is destroying the very fabric of their life.\nIf a reply is even seen come in my inbox from you, I will immediately take it as you reject the terms of this settlement and\nwill proceed to have you served by the U.S. Marshall or alternative service if necessary .\nWhen Mara and Caroline grow up, this decision before you here will determine if you're the man who helped destroy their\nfamily, or the man who helped repair it.\nIf Morgan wants a divorce, she must do it the right way.  This was not the right way to handle it Dan, and you know that.\nFor what it's worth - take care.\nCharlie Myers3/10/25, 4:43 PM Gmail - Your Only Settlement Offer\nhttps://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ik=13839461f7&view=pt&search=all&permmsgid=msg-a:r-7413092481712777159&simpl=msg-a:r-74130924817127\u2026 3/3M.1761 M.1761\nM.1761 M.1761 M.1761 M.1761",
