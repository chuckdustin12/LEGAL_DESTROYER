Respondent files this notice to ensure the record reflects the legal effect of the Court\u2019s \nruling denying Respondent\u2019s no-evidence motion.  \n2. Regardless of denial, Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 193.6 operates automatically  to \nexclude any exhibits or testimony not timely disclosed in discovery . \n3. The Texas Supreme Court has made clear that:  \ni. nondisclosed materials cannot be used at summary judgment or trial,  \nii. attaching such materials to a response does not cure nondisclosure , and \niii. exclusion is mandatory, absent a record finding of good cause or absence of unfair \nsurprise. See Fort Brown Villas III Condo. Ass\u2019n v. Gillenwater , 285 S.W.3d 879 (Tex. \n2009); Montes v. Montes , No. 04-20-00474-CV (Tex. App. Jul. 28, 2021); Alvarado v. \nFarah Mfg.

      "text": "2 \n i. Produced no evidence in response to discovery , \nii. Submitted new affidavits and allegations for the first time in her MSJ reply,  \niii. Never identified any witnesses or supplemented disclosures, and  \niv. Offered unsworn, unauthenticated, hearsay materials.  \n5. Under Rule 193.6, these materials remain inadmissible at trial unless Petitioner \naffirmatively moves to show good cause or lack of unfair surprise \u2014 neither of which exists, nor \nhas been asserted.  \n6. Accordingly, Respondent respectfully notes for the record that:  \nThe Court\u2019s denial of summary judgment does not authorize Petitioner to use evidence she failed to disclose. Rule 193.6 exclusion applies automatically and continues to govern trial.  \nRespondent will object at trial to any attempt to introduce nondisclosed exhibits or testimony.  \n7. It is also worth noting that the trial court has discretion to postpone trial and impose \nsanctions to cure any prejudice resulting from late disclosure, as recognized in  Alvarado v. Farah \nMfg. Co., Inc. (Tex. 1992). However, this is an alternative to exclusion and does not alter the default rule.  \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \n  /s/ Charles Dustin Myers  \n CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS  \n PRO -SE RESPONDENT  \n CHUCKDUSTIN12@GMAIL.COM  \n 817-546-3693",
