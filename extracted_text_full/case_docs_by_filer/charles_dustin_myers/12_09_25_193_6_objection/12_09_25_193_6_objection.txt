M.E.M. AND C.R.M.,  
CHILDREN                                                                       TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS  
 
 
RESPONDENT’S NOTICE OF RULE 193.6 OBJECTION AND REQUEST FOR 
CLARIFICATION  
 
TO THE HONORABLE COURT:  
1. Respondent files this notice to ensure the record reflects the legal effect of the Court’s 
ruling denying Respondent’s no-evidence motion.  
2. Regardless of denial, Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 193.6 operates automatically  to 
exclude any exhibits or testimony not timely disclosed in discovery . 
3. The Texas Supreme Court has made clear that:  
i. nondisclosed materials cannot be used at summary judgment or trial,  
ii. attaching such materials to a response does not cure nondisclosure , and 
iii. exclusion is mandatory, absent a record finding of good cause or absence of unfair 
surprise. See Fort Brown Villas III Condo. Ass’n v. Gillenwater , 285 S.W.3d 879 (Tex. 
2009); Montes v. Montes , No. 04-20-00474-CV (Tex. App. Jul. 28, 2021); Alvarado v. 
Farah Mfg. Co., 830 S.W.2d 911 (Tex. 1992).

 i. Produced no evidence in response to discovery , 
ii. Submitted new affidavits and allegations for the first time in her MSJ reply,  
iii. Never identified any witnesses or supplemented disclosures, and  
iv. Offered unsworn, unauthenticated, hearsay materials.  
5. Under Rule 193.6, these materials remain inadmissible at trial unless Petitioner 
affirmatively moves to show good cause or lack of unfair surprise — neither of which exists, nor 
has been asserted.  
6. Accordingly, Respondent respectfully notes for the record that:  
The Court’s denial of summary judgment does not authorize Petitioner to use evidence she failed to disclose. Rule 193.6 exclusion applies automatically and continues to govern trial.  
Respondent will object at trial to any attempt to introduce nondisclosed exhibits or testimony.  
7. It is also worth noting that the trial court has discretion to postpone trial and impose 
sanctions to cure any prejudice resulting from late disclosure, as recognized in  Alvarado v. Farah 
Mfg. Co., Inc. (Tex. 1992). However, this is an alternative to exclusion and does not alter the default rule.
