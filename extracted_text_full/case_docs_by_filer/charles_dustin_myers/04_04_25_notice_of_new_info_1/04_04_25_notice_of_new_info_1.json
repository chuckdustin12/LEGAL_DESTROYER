      "text": "5. The current orders , despite bearing the Associate Judge \u2019s signature, are void  \nand of n o legal effect . \n6. The Respondent has s uffered now over $1 10,500 in verifiable damages due to \nbeing unlawfully locked out of his residence on March 6, 2024.  \n7. The Respondent cannot find alternative housing while being barred from \nbeing able to work.  \n8. The Petitioner knows this to be true but  instead sabotaged the Respondent \u2019s \nability to provide for the children for the purpose of pursuing an extramarital  \nrelationship that began prior to the commencement of these proceedings.  \n9. The Petitioner is now ENGAGED to DAMEN KAZLAUSKAS, who proposed to Petitioner in the presence of the children.  \n10. There is no child support set up for the children.  \n11. Petitioner continues to dispose of Respondent \u2019s personal belongings. \n12. Desp ite her authority being in question, and despite her failure to prosecute, \nCOOPER L. CARTER unilaterally inter rupted emergency proceedings on \nMarch 28, 2025, claiming that the case would be consolidated the following week  without being present in the courtroom.  \n13. The 233\nrd district court blatantly denied the Respondent due process in the \nface o f COOPER L. CARTER \u2019s false promise.  \n14. COOPER L. CARTER doesn \u2019t know the law, because you cannot consolidate \na SAPCR with a divorce matter unless the suit is transferred according to the TEXAS FAMILY CODE.",

      "text": "15. The court , at this point, is choosing to not grant relief despite having no reason \nto do so. \n16. This litigation has no possible means to an end, and it should be dismissed \noutright so that the SAPCR may continue. \n17. There has been no filed opposition, objection, or arguments made against the Respondent \u2019s position in either suit.  \n18. The Petitioner has wasted everyone \u2019s time, cau sed significant damage, and \nremains hidden in fear of being held accountable.  \n19. The Petitioner prioritized an extramarital affair over prosecuting the divorce, and the children and Respondent have been signi ficantly harmed.  \nTherefore, this case should be dismissed as a matter of law. Every day causes more \nirreparable harm, and this court has every abili ty an d reason to rectify this s ituation immediately.  \nRespondent already has the solution and has been the only party in this matter seeking relief. It is \nsimply unacceptable to permit this to co ntinue. \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \n /s/ Charles Du stin M yers \n CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS  \n CHUCKDUSTIN12@GMAIL.COM  \n 817-546-3693  \n PRO -SE",
