 I. INTRODUCTION  
 
1. Morgan Michelle Myers has not demonstrated that she can act in the best interests of the 
children because her conduct —including making unsubstantiated abuse allegations, obstructing 
the children’s relationship with their father, and engaging in litigation tactics that undermine 
stability and truthfulness —contravenes the statutory and judicial standards that define a parent’s 
ability to serve the children’s welfare. Texas law and case authority require credible evidence and a demonstrated commitment to st ability, co -parenting, and honesty, all of which are lacking in 
her actions as documented in the record.  
2. Texas law mandates that the best interests of the child are the primary consideration in all 
conservatorship and access decisions, emphasizing stability, frequent and continuing contact with both parents, and the avoidance of unnecessary restrictions unles s credible evidence of danger 
exists. The record in this case shows that Morgan Michelle Myers has repeatedly advanced unsubstantiated claims of abuse, failed to provide evidence supporting her allegations, obstructed the children’s relationship with th eir father, and engaged in procedural misconduct, all of which 
undermine the statutory presumption favoring shared parenting and stability.  
3. The relevant statutes and case law make clear that a parent who leverages false or 
unsupported allegations, manipulates protective order processes, or otherwise acts to sever the children’s relationship with the other parent without credible justification is not acting in the children’s best interests. Courts have consistently held that such conduct justifies sanctions, restrictions, or even changes in conservatorship, as it is contrary to the public policy and legal standards that prioritize the welfare, stability, and emotional health of the children . Here, Morgan 
intentionally disrupted the status quo of the children to pursue an affair, which she has prioritized over these very proceedings. The relevant statutes are discussed in detail below.

5 
 II. LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK  
4. The Texas Family Code establishes that the best interest of the child is the paramount 
consideration in all matters of conservatorship, possession, and access (Tex. Fam. Code § 
153.002). The public policy of Texas is to ensure children have frequent and continuing contact with parents who have shown the ability to act in their best interests, to provide a safe and stable environment, and to encourage shared parental rights and duties after separation (Tex. Fam. Code § 153.001). Any restriction or denial of a parent’s access must be no greater than necessary to protect the child’s best interest (Tex. Fam. Code § 153.193). 5. When allegations of abuse or family violence are made, the law requires credible 
evidence to rebut the presumption that standard possession and access serve the child’s best interest ( Tex. Fam. Code § 153.004). Courts must consider whether a protective order has been 
rendered and whether there is a history or pattern of abuse, but unsupported or disproven allegations do not justify restrictions.  
7. Texas appellate courts have repeatedly emphasized that the best -interest analysis is child -
centered and focuses on factors such as the stability of the home, the acts or omissions of each parent, and whether a parent fosters or undermines the child’s relat ionship with the other parent 
(In re Marriage of Waters , 07-25-00057-CV (Tex. App. Nov 18, 2025);  W.G. v. Tex. Dep't of 
Family & Protective Servs .; In re A.I.G., 135 S.W.3d 687 (Tex. App. 2003)). The Holley factors, 
which guide best -interest determinati ons, include the child’s emotional and physical needs, the 
stability of the home, the parenting abilities of each parent, and the acts or omissions that may indicate an improper parent -child relationship. 
7. Courts have condemned conduct that obstructs a child’s relationship with the other 
parent, including making false allegations, interfering with access, and using litigation as a tool

6 
 to gain leverage rather than to protect the child ( Marriage of Chandler, Matter of , 914 S.W.2d 
252 (Tex. App. 1996);  Gunther v. Gunther , 478 S.W.2d 821 (Tex. Ct. App. 1972)). Such conduct 
is considered legally reprehensible and contrary to the child’s best interests.  
8. When a parent’s allegations are not supported by credible evidence, and especially when 
they are contradicted by the record or deemed admissions, courts have found that the parent has 
not demonstrated the ability to act in the child’s best interests ( Magro v. Magro, NO. 01-19-
00701-CV (Tex. App. Dec 10, 2020);  Interest of C.S., 717 S.W.3d 1). The law also allows courts 
to infer a parent’s likely future conduct from past deliberate conduct, particularly when that conduct has endangered the child’s safety or well -being (In re J.J.H., No. 04-18-00738-CV (Tex. 
App. Feb 06, 2019);  In re G.K.B., 04-21-00528-CV (Tex. App. May 04, 2022)). 
9. Here, Morgan Michelle Myers’ conduct throughout the litigation has been damaging to 
the overall well -being of the children both emotionally and financially, and the record establishes 
that she has made no effort to rebut the claims made against her that are tied to specific elements of the Texas Family Code.  
10. Indeed, Respondent has been wronged by Petitioner, and the Children have suffered harm 
because of her actions – however, the Respondent understands and is well aware that despite these actions, he still must proceed in a manner that is best suited for his  Children, which is to 
have their mother in their life despite her egregious actions and misrepresentations made to this Court. Respondent is confident that this Court will adopt this parenting plan, and effectuate the long-needed recovery period that i s long overdue in this case. We now turn to Petitioner’s 
conduct.  
11. By adopting this parenting plan, the status quo will be restored to the last peaceful time 
prior to Morgan’s intentional misrepresentations to this Court.

7 
 III. PETITIONER’S CONDUCT  
A. Unsubstantiated Allegations and Lack of Credible Evidence  
9. The record indicates that Morgan Michelle Myers has repeatedly made allegations of 
child abuse, neglect, and family violence without providing new sworn evidence or addressing 
the contrary proof in the mandamus record. Texas law requires that any restricti on or denial of a 
parent’s access be supported by credible evidence, not speculation or disproven claims (Tex. Fam. Code § 153.004). The absence of a protective order or any finding of family violence, combined with the nonsuit of the protective -order proceeding, means there is no legal or factual 
basis for denying or severely restricting the father’s access.  
10. The Texas Supreme Court  has held that advancing unsubstantiated or disproven 
allegations, especially when used to justify emergency relief or to gain leverage in custody disputes, is contrary to the best -interest standard and may warrant sanctions (Low v. Henry, 221 
S.W.3d 609 (Tex. 2007)). The persistence in making such allegations, despite their refutation in the record and the lack of any credible evidence, demonstrates a disregard for the truth and the children’s need for stability and a relationshi p with both parents.  
B. Obstruction of the Parent-Child Relationship  
11. Texas public policy and case law strongly favor frequent and continuing contact between 
children and both parents who are fit and able to act in the children’s best interests (Tex. Fam. Code § 153.001;  In re J.R.D., 169 S.W.3d 740 (Tex. 2005)). Conduct that obstructs this 
relationship —such as blocking communication, denying access, or making false allegations to 
justify exclusion—has been repeatedly condemned by Texas courts as contrary to the child’s welfare ( Marriage of Chandler, Matter of , 914 S.W.2d 252 (Tex. App. 1996);  Gunther v. 
Gunther , 478 S.W.2d 821 (Tex. Ct. App. 1972)).

8 
 12. The record shows that Morgan’s actions resulted in the father’s removal from the home 
and a significant restriction of his contact with the children, not based on any adjudicated finding 
of danger but on unsupported claims. This pattern of conduct is preci sely the type of behavior 
Texas courts have found to be legally reprehensible and inconsistent with the best interests of the child.  
C. Instability and Manipulation of Legal Processes  
13. Stability and permanence are paramount considerations in the best -interest analysis ( In re 
G.K.B ., 04-21-00528-CV (Tex. App. May 04, 2022)). The use of litigation tactics —such as filing 
serial amended petitions with escalating allegations, failing to respond to discovery, and ignoring deemed admissions —undermines the stability of the children’s envir onment and the integrity of 
the judicial process. Courts have recognized that such conduct, especially when it results in the unjustified removal of a paren t or the disruption of the children’s home and financial security, is 
contrary to the children’s best interests ( In re Marriage of Waters , 07-25-00057-CV (Tex. App. 
Nov 18, 2025);  Van Heerden v. Van Heerden, 321 S.W.3d 869 (Tex. App. 2010)). 
14. Moreover, the failure to address or rebut specific allegations of financial misconduct, 
fraud, and civil conspiracy, as well as the refusal to clarify the authority of counsel, further demonstrates a lack of commitment to transparency and the children’s welfare.  
D. Failure to Foster Co-Parenting and Shared Parental Duties  
15. The Texas Family Code encourages parents to share in the rights and duties of raising 
their children after separation (Tex. Fam. Code § 153.001). The record reflects that Morgan has not only failed to foster the children’s relationship with their father but has actively worked to sever it, including by introducing a new partner and attempting to install a replacement father figure. Such conduct is inconsistent with the statutory mandate and the Holley factors, which

9 
 prioritize the child’s need for a stable, loving relationship with both parents ( In re A.I.G., 135 
S.W.3d 687 (Tex. App. 2003)).  
E. Legal and Procedural Violations  
16. The procedural record shows that Morgan’s pleadings are not only substantively deficient 
but also procedurally improper. The failure to respond to requests for admission results in those 
matters being deemed admitted, including the absence of family violen ce and the occurrence of 
financial misconduct (Tex. R. Civ. P. 198.2(c)). The use of undisclosed evidence or witnesses is barred by Rule 193.6, and the lack of authority of counsel further undermines the legitimacy of her pleadings (Tex. R. Civ. P. 193.6). These violations reinforce the conclusion that Morgan has not acted in the children’s best interests, as she has failed to comply with the basic requirements of honesty, transparency, and procedural fairness. 
IV. CONCLUSION – PETITIONER’S CONDUCT  
17. In sum, Morgan Michelle Myers has not demonstrated that she can act in the best 
interests of the children under Texas law. Her conduct —characterized by unsubstantiated and 
disproven allegations, obstruction of the children’s relationship with their father, manipulation of legal processes, and disregard for stability and co -parenting —contravenes the statutory mandates 
and judicial standards that define a parent’s ability to serve the children’s welfare. Texas courts have consistently held that such behav ior justifies sanctions, restrictions, or changes in 
conservatorship, as it is fundamentally inconsistent with the best interests of the child. The record supports the conclusion that Morgan’s actions have been motivated by personal or tactical advantage r ather than a genuine concern for the children’s safety or well -being, and thus she has 
not met the legal standard required to demonstrate that she can act in their best interests.

10 
 18. The forthcoming parenting plan serves the best interests of the children, aims to seek 
restoration rather than division, and provides a comprehensive framework that will ensure the 
children remain in their stable, nurturing environment that they have know n their entire lives up 
until Morgan’s deliberate actions disrupted it.  
19. Respondent’s parenting plan considers each parent, relatives, their needs, and provides 
for an amicable resolution that puts the focus of this matter back where the Texas Family Code mandates: the best interests of the children.  
V. THE TRUE STATUS QUO  
A. Family  Dynamics  
20. Prior to Morgan’s intentional lies at the onset of this case, M.E.M. and C.R.M. enjoyed an 
environment where both parents were a daily presence in their lives. Due to Respondent’s at -
home work status, this enabled him to be involved in every aspect of thei r lives. For example, 
Respondent would get them ready for school, walk them to school, visit them for lunch, pick them up from school, help with homework, ensure they made it to their extracurricular activities, cooked meals, gave them baths, and read them  bedtime stories each night, as the countless 
images and videos would show if presented to this Court.  
21. Furthermore, the matrimonial residence resides directly next -door to Morgan’s 
grandparents, who have not participated in these proceedings and are victims themselves of Morgan’s lies. Text messages and other correspondence would show that, in fact, the Re spondent 
and the grandparents were able to have amicable discussions regarding the Children during the litigation.

11 
 22. Finally, the Children’s Aunt, Caitlin Wilson, resided in the backyard between 2015 and 
2025, but had no direct involvement with the Children regarding daily care throughout the 
marriage.  
23. Regarding finances, and contrary to Morgan’s sworn affidavit of indigency, the 
Respondent was the primary breadwinner and relied on the matrimonial residence to support his family due to the need for a specific internet connection and an environment that cannot be replicated elsewhere on short notice. Morgan was aware of this necessity, as the internet within the home had just been upgraded prior to these proceedings to meet Respondent’s growing business demands. This parenting plan also aims to restore the children’s financial future.  
B. Application of Law to the Described Environment 
24. The Children’s true environment  described  above —where both parents were daily, hands -
on caregivers, the Respondent worked from home and was deeply involved in every aspect of the children’s lives, the home was adjacent to supportive grandparents, and the family’s financial stability was tied to the res idence—exemplifies the type of arrangement the Texas Family Code 
seeks to protect and restore.  
C. Frequent and Continuing Contact with Both Parents  
25. The Family Code’s public policy, as set out in § 153.001 and reinforced by § 153.251, is 
to ensure that children have frequent and continuing contact with both parents who are able to act in their best interest. The described status quo, where the Responde nt was present for school 
routines, meals, extracurricular activities, and bedtime, and where both parents were daily presences, directly fulfills this policy. The law does not require equal division of time, but it does require that both parents have meaningful, ongoing involvement in the child’s life, as confirmed in Stillwell v. Stillwell  and In re J.R.D., 169 S.W.3d 740 (Tex. 2005).

12 
 D. Stability, Continuity, and Minimizing Disruption  
26. Family Code §§ 153.134 and 153.133 require courts to minimize disruption to the child’s 
education, daily routine, and social associations. The described environment —where the 
children’s routines, schooling, and social connections are maintained, and where the 
Respondent’ s work-from -home status ensures ongoing stability—aligns with this statutory 
mandate. The proximity to grandparents and the absence of disruption from the aunt’s presence 
further support the stability and continuity of the children’s env ironment.  
E. Supportive Extended Family 27. Section 263.307 lists the availability of an extended family support system as a factor in 
determining the best interest of the child. The fact that the children’s grandparents live next door and have maintained amicable relations with the Respondent, as evidenced by text messages and correspondence, provides a strong support network for the children. This is precisely the type of social support the law encourages, as it enhances the children’s sense of security and belonging.  
F. Parental Rights and Duties  
28. Section 151.001 outlines the rights and duties of parents, including the duty to provide 
care, control, protection, support, and education. The Respondent’s daily involvement in the children’s lives —getting them ready for school, helping with homework, ens uring participation 
in extracurricular activities, and providing meals and bedtime care—demonstrates the exercise of these statutory duties. The financial reliance on the home, including the need for a specific internet connection to support the Respon dent’s work and the family’s financial stability, further 
aligns with the duty to provide for the children’s needs.

13 
 G. Presumption of Joint Managing Conservatorship  
29. Section 153.131 creates a rebuttable presumption that appointing both parents as joint 
managing conservators is in the child’s best interest, absent evidence of significant impairment or 
family violence. The described environment, with both parents active ly involved and no 
indication of harm or violence, supports the application of this presumption. The courts have consistently upheld this principle, as seen in  major cases such as  Kom v. Kom  and In re C.J.C.  
H. Minimal Restriction on Parental Access  
30. Section 153.193 mandates that any restriction on a parent’s possession or access must be 
the minimum necessary to protect the child’s best interest. The described status quo, where the Respondent’s access is unrestricted and both parents are daily presences, is consistent with this requirement. Courts have held that broad or punitive restrictions are disfavored unless there is 
clear evidence of harm . 
I. Best Interest Factors and Holley Analysis  
31. The “Holley factors,” as established in  Holley v. Adams  and codified by statute, provide a 
framework for assessing the best interest of the child. These factors include the child’s emotional 
and physical needs, the stability of the home, the parental abilities of the caregivers, and the plans for the child. The described environment —daily parental involvement, stable home, 
supportive extended family, and financial security —addresses each of these factors favorably.  
J. Financial Stability and Support  
32. Section 151.001 also imposes a duty on parents to support their children, including 
providing for their education and general welfare. The Respondent’s role as the primary breadwinner, reliance on the home for work, and recent upgrades to the home’s internet 
infrastructure to meet business demands all contribute to the children’s financial stability and

14 
 future. The law recognizes the importance of a stable, supportive environment for the child’s 
development.  
K. Synthesis   
33. Taken together, the legislative provisions and case law create a coherent legal framework 
that prioritizes the child’s best interest through frequent, continuing contact with both parents, stability in the child’s environment, and the support of extended family. The described status quo—where both parents are daily, hands -on caregivers, the home is stable and tailored to the 
children’s needs, and the family’s financial future is secure—embodies the very environment the Family Code seeks to protect and restore.  
L. Caveats  
34. While the law strongly favors the described environment, there are exceptions. The 
presumption of joint managing conservatorship and frequent contact with both parents can be rebutted if there is evidence that such an arrangement would significantly impair  the child’s 
physical health or emotional development, or if there is a history of family violence. In such cases, the court may impose restrictions or allocate rights and duties differently to protect the child’s best interest.  Here, the current arran gement manufactured by Morgan fits this exception.  
VI. THE MANUFACTURED STATUS QUO  
35. Today, the Children are not raised by their mother or their father but are now cared for by 
a variety of individuals who previously had no such role in the Children’s lives. For example, 
after gaining sole use of the residency, the Mother began to effecti vely erase the Respondent 
from the household. She boxed up all of his belongings, began introducing her extramarital 
partner into the children’s daily lives. Indeed, these allegations are unrebutted in the record.

15 
 36. They now go long periods of time without any communication with their Paternal side of 
the family, because Mother has put forth no meaningful effort to maintain the Children’s 
relationship with Father. Mother claims these attempts to communicate and discu ss medical 
needs for the Children are harassment, and seeks to deny his access to the Children outright with 
newfound claims of child abuse.  
37. The children have regressed in their schooling, the youngest child suffered a major 
medical incident in March of 2025 because of Mother’s failure to provide the necessary medical care to the children, and the only communication with the children occurs between cellular phones acquired by Mother’s grandparents, further showing their willingness to promote some form of relationship during this time.  
38. Rather than enjoy a stable environment, they have had chaos introduced into their lives, 
and the centerpiece of stability was abruptly removed by a parent with an alternative motive rather than the best interests of her children.  
39. Their financial future, once secure and promising, has now been significantly damaged 
due to Mother’s intentional conduct, resulting in significant financial losses that directly impact the well -being of the children now and in the future.  
40. The children have lost their Father, their great grandparents have been thrust into a 
parenting role, and their Aunt and Mother’s extramarital partner now are involved in the children’s lives frequently, a stark contrast to their true status quo and this States public policy. 41. This parenting plan seeks to restore stability to the children’s lives, restore the 
Respondents rights and access to his home so that he may plan accordingly for the future in accordance with the children’s best interests, and provide the most efficient path forward that focuses on both recovery and sustainability for all parties, including Mother.

16 
 VII. RESTORATION OF THE TRUE STATUS QUO  
A. The Simple Fact of this Case  
42. At its core, this case is simple. Petitioner made a mistake and then lied to avoid 
accountability. Those lies —that an active protective order with a finding of family violence in 
the marriage already existed, that family violence had in fact occurred, and that she was 
financially indigent —are the very claims she failed to support with competent evidence in the 
summary judgment proceedings. Yet those same false assertions are what originally awarded her 
exclusive possession of the children and the home. The current record strips away that narrative 
and leaves no lawful basis to continue excluding Respondent from his children or their residence , 
and Mother should not enjoy these benefits designed for families in true emergency situations.  
43. The current, litigation -driven arrangement  has introduced instability, disrupted the 
children’s routines, and replaced parental care with a patchwork of previously uninvolved adults. The record, as described, contains no credible evidence of family violence or significant 
impairment that justifies the ongoing exclusion of Respondent from the residence or the 
children’s daily lives. Such evidence doesn’t exist, because Respondent has never hit anyone. 
The absence of a protective order, the lack of substantiated findings of danger, and the procedural deficiencies in the opposing party’s case —culminating in Petitioner’s failure at summary 
judgment to prove the very allegations she used to secure exclusive possession —all reinforce the 
statutory presumption i n favor of restoring Respondent’s access and the prior stable environment. 
Respondent’s presence in the home poses no danger to anyone and simply restores the lawful 
status quo that existed before Petitioner’s misrepresentations.  
44. Texas law is clear that restrictions on a parent’s access must be narrowly tailored and 
supported by credible evidence (Tex. Fam. Code § 153.193; Fish v. Lebrie (Tex. App. Dec. 10,

17 
 2010)). Courts repeatedly reverse or modify orders that impose broad or blanket restrictions 
without such evidence, emphasizing that the best interest of the child is not served by unnecessary disruption or by depriving children of meaningful contact with a fit parent ( In re 
R . P. (Tex. App. Feb. 28, 2024); Stillwell v. Stillwell , No. 03-17-00457-CV (Tex. App. Oct. 17, 
2018)). Where, as here, the restrictions flow from unproven allegations and strategic misrepresentations that later collapse under scrutiny, continuation of those restrictions contradicts both statute and precedent.  
45. The Holley factors, which remain authoritative despite being codified by statute, further 
support restoration of the status quo. The children’s emotional and physical needs, the stability of the home, the parental abilities of Respondent, and the plans for  the children all weigh in favor of 
returning to the prior arrangement (Holley v. Adams , 544 S.W.2d 367 (Tex. 1976), codified by 
Corrales v. Department of Family and Protective Services , 155 S.W.3d 478 (Tex. App. 2004)). 
The evidence of academic regres sion, medical neglect, and emotional harm under the current 
arrangement —an arrangement built on Petitioner’s unproven accusations —underscores the 
urgent need for corrective action and for reinstating the parent whose presence historically supported the chi ldren’s stability and progress. 
46. Moreover, the proximity of the holidays amplifies the importance of stability, family 
connection, and the opportunity for the children to experience the comfort and joy of their established home and routines. Texas courts recognize the significance of mini mizing disruption 
and preserving continuity, especially during meaningful family occasions (Tex. Fam. Code § 153.134; Bates v. Tesar , 81 S.W.3d 411 (Tex. App. 2002)). In a case where the alleged 
justification for disruption has now been exposed as unsupported, the equities and the law converge in favor of prompt restoration.

18 
 B. Why Respondent Should Be Restored  to the Residence 
Restoring Respondent to the residence and the pre -litigation status quo not only aligns with 
Texas law, it follows directly from the facts of this case. The Texas Family Code and controlling 
case law establish that:  
i. Best Interest and Stability.  
The children’s best interests are served by returning them to a stable, familiar environment with daily involvement from both parents and supportive extended family (Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002; W.G. v. Tex. Dep't of Family & Protective Servs. (Tex. App. Jul. 7, 2023)). Here, Respondent’s presence historically provided that stability; it is 
Petitioner’s unproven allegations and the resulting litigation -driven arrangement that 
introduced instability.  
ii. Presumption of Joint Managing Conservatorship. There is a strong presumption that both parents serve as joint managing conservators and that restrictions arise only from credible evidence of danger or significant impairment (Tex. Fam. Code § 153.131; Kom v. Kom (Tex. App. Apr. 8, 2025)). Petitioner’s c laims 
of family violence and indigency —assertions used to displace Respondent from the 
home —are the same claims she failed to substantiate in the summary judgment record, 
leaving the presumption intact and und isplaced.  
iii. Minimal Restriction on Access.  
Any restriction on Respondent’s access must be no greater than necessary, and the current broad exclusion lacks support in the competent evidence (Tex. Fam. Code § 153.193; Fish v. Lebrie (Tex. App. Dec. 10, 2010)). Once Petitioner’s allegations fall away for lack

19 
 of proof, no lawful basis remains for the extraordinary remedy of ongoing exclusion from 
the residence and the children’s daily lives.  
iv. Correction of Unjustified Interference.  
Courts condemn and correct conduct that unjustifiably interferes with a child’s 
relationship with a parent, especially where motivated by personal or tactical advantage 
rather than genuine concern for the child’s welfare ( Marriage of Chandler, Matter of , 914 
S.W.2d 252 (Tex. App. 1996)). Petitioner’s initial misrepresentations and her later failure 
to verify them at summary judgment show precisely this type of unjustified interference: a tactical use of false claims t o gain the home and children, without the evidentiary 
support the law requires.  
v. Material and Substantial Change.  
The documented instability, academic and medical regression, and introduction of new caregivers constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances, justifying modification to restore the prior arrangement (Tex. Fam. Code § 156.101; Jenkins v. Jenkins , 16 S.W.3d 473 (Tex. App. 2000)). The “change” in this case arises directly from 
Petitioner’s unproven narrative. Once that narrative fails, the law points back to the last stable, functioning arrangement —the pre -litigation status quo with Respondent in the 
residence.  
47. The law does not support ongoing, broad restrictions in the absence of proven danger. 
The facts here show that the children’s best interests are served by restoring the status quo ante, returning Respondent to the residence, and reestablishing the children ’s routines, stability, and 
family connections. Respondent’s presence in the home poses no danger to anyone; it simply

20 
 corrects the consequences of Petitioner’s initial misrepresentations and realigns the orders with 
the actual evidence.  
C. The Importance of Timely Restoration  
48. Secondary materials and psychological research further highlight the urgency of prompt 
restoration. Delays in correcting unjustified interference with the parent -child relationship can 
lead to entrenched resistance and long -term harm to the children’s emot ional development 
(Parental Interference (2021-04-12)). Early, decisive court action prevents further deterioration and maximizes the chances of successful reunification and recovery. In this case, where the foundational allegations lack evidentiary su pport, ongoing delay only deepens harm that serves 
no legitimate protective purpose.  
49. With the holiday season approaching, the opportunity to restore the children’s sense of 
security, belonging, and joy becomes especially compelling. The law’s emphasis on stability, continuity, and frequent, meaningful contact with both parents is never mor e salient than during 
times of family significance—particularly where the current disruption stems from accusations that do not survive scrutiny.  
50. Below is the recovery plan that will re-establish the Children’s status quo and preserve 
their well being during this process. 
VIII. THE RECOVERY PLAN  
A. Residency  
51. Respondent will reside at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148 with the Children. 
Mother may choose between cohabitation or alternative residency. The children’s interests are best served with both parents in the home, as no violence or conditions exist or have ever existed that would require one parent to leave the home. If the Petitioner decides co -habitation is not an

21 
 option for her, she has several other housing options available to her, including next -door and 
several properties owned by her Grandparents. Respondent does not have this luxury, and relies 
on the home to provide for his children and care for them.  
52. The Children are to remain in the home they have been in their entire lives, which 
remains at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148. B. Daily Care  
53. Respondent is available twenty -four hours a day, seven days per week to care for the 
Children given his hybrid work from home / parent from home status. Based on reasonable belief, Mother has acquired a full time job where she works outside of the home at  least four 
days per week.  
54. Therefore, while Mother is at work, Respondent can care for the Children so that they 
remain in the care of one of their parents for the majority of time rather than being cared for by their relatives, who can return to their normal role in the Children’s  lives.  
55. Respondent can get the Children ready for school in the mornings, walk them to school, 
visit them for lunch, take them home from school, help with homework, provide hygienic needs, provide transportation to any extracurricular activities, schedule and mai ntain medical care, 
schedule visits with the nearby extended family, and will foster a relationship with Mother.  
56. Mother can be with the Children while not at work and on her days off, thus providing 
the Children with the frequent access to both parents that they have been without for nearly two years. C. Relationships  
57. All parties are to treat each other with respect, and should not effectuate any actions that 
would interfere with the best interests of the children. Neither party should introduce or

22 
 otherwise expose the Children to any extramarital relationship until after the divorce is finalized 
to preserve their emotional stability.  
D. Weekly Reports  
58. Both Mother and Respondent should be required to file a weekly status update with the 
Court and served upon each other to ensure that the recovery period remains in alignment with the best interests of the children. The report should include:  
 i. The children’s health;  
 ii. The children’s performance in school;  
 iii. The days and times spent with the children;  
 iv. Any third parties who cared for the children;  
 v.  Any concerns about the Children.  
This will keep the Court as well as the parties informed of the recovery process.  
IX. CONCLUSION  
59. Respondent’s proposed parenting plan rests firmly on Texas statutory law and controlling 
appellate authority. The best interests of the children, the presumption favoring joint managing conservatorship, the requirement of minimal restriction on access, and  the paramount importance 
of stability and continuity all point in the same direction: restoration of Respondent to the residence and reestablishment of the children’s prior environment.  
60. This case reduces to a straightforward proposition. Petitioner made a mistake, then 
attempted to shield herself from accountability by advancing false claims of an existing protective order, family violence, and financial indigency. She then failed, in sum mary judgment 
proceedings, to prove those same claims. Those misrepresentations temporarily gave her the

23 
 children and the home, but they do not survive the scrutiny of the record or the standards of 
Texas law.  
61. In the absence of credible evidence justifying ongoing restrictions, and in light of the 
documented harm under the current arrangement, the children’s best interests and the governing 
legal framework both support Respondent’s restoration. The Court should adopt Respondent’s plan, return him to the residence, and give the children what the law and the evidence already support: the stability, family connection, and hope that come from a safe, loving parent restored to his rightful place in their daily liv es.
