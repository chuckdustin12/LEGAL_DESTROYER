7 II. THE CURRENT ORDERS
6. On February 1st, 2024, the parties entered into an agreement which was
signed as to form and substance by both parties through their attorneys of record.  
7. As part of the agreement, the following provisions were ordered:
8.Immediately  after signing the above agreement, the Respo ndent
strategically terminated his legal repre sentation due to the absurdity of settling and 
allowing the Petitioner to leverage her claims.  M.1950 M.1950
M.1950 M.1950 M.1950 M.1950A typed written Order conforming to this Report will follow within 20 days from the dntc this 
Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be prepared by P/f:11/ B tf"C,f V-S . 
Each attorney should approve the Order. The parties do not need to approve the Order. The 
atlorncy reviewing the proposed Order shall have five (5) days to do so. There arc no ten (l 0) day 
letters. If an agreement is not reached, a Motion lo Sign shall be filed and sci within thirty (30) days 
from the signing of this Report. 
AGREED AS TO. FORM AND SUBSTANCE 
icy for.Petitioner o/2-d!:,.l~ 
r,iv.lL~Q · Respondent ~ 
SO, ORDERED: 
---

8 9. Most disturbing is that this settlement agreement permitted the Petitioner
to remo ve her children from their own home  for an entire month – a clear 
disregard for their well being – and the court signed off on this.  
10. Further, this agreement was challenged via a motion to reconsider whic h
was denied on March 14th, 2024, but Judge Kaitcer.  
11. To date, no findings of fact or conclusions of law have been issued
regarding this ruling despite notif ying the court that they are past- due. 
12.At the hearing on March 14th, 2024, the docket re flects only the
Respondent appearing before the court. 
13.Just prior to the hearing, Respondent was served the current orders by
COOPER L. CARTER, not DAN BACALIS, just minutes b efore the hearing was 
to commence that was filed to challenge them.  
14.Despite the agreement stating that a typed written order s hall be
prepared by Dan Bacalis, despite the 20 day time  limit, and despite the five day 
review period that all parties and Judge Kaitcer agreed to -  the orders were 
permitted to be prepared at the last minute by COOPER L. CARTER, well after the 
20-day deadline, and de spite the Respondent ’s consent not being present, he was
ordered to sign the agreement in violation of Texas Law  by 1:30 P.M. that same 
day. M.1951 M.1951
M.1951 M.1951 M.1951 M.1951

9 15. The above order clearly shows two distinct handwritings – one from
COOPER L. CARTER, and one from Judge Kaitcer – ‘for his business ’ – showing 
a pre- determine d outcome . 
III. CONCLUSION
16.There is no doubt that this matter is filled with deception and unethical
practices. The Petitioner,  in an effort to conceal her marital affair, had no problem 
taking her own children out of their home, falsifying her financial status after 
converting funds from the marital estate with the assistance of a  third party, M.1952 M.1952
