IN THE 233RD DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY , TEXAS  
TO THE HONORABLE 233rd DISTRICT COURT:  
Petitioner, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, respectfully submits this motion to str ike  
Respondent’s answer and motion to consolidate, and in support thereof, would  show the court the 
following: 
I.STATE MENT OF FACTS
1. On Mar ch 20, 2025, Respondent, MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS, filed an answer
entering a general denial for the claims made against her  and a motion to consolidate. 
2. The response alleges that it was necessary for the Respondent to acquire the services of
Cooper L. Carter. IN RE: M.E.M., ET AL.

  3. The Respondent’s answer and motion to consolidate were filed on Cooper Car ter’s 
behalf by Roderick D. Marx, a party not named in either this suit or the related divorce suit (322-
744263-23). 
 4. Roderick D. M arx has filed all pleadings on Cooper Carter ’s behalf because Cooper 
Carter ’s electronic filing manager credentials are registered under the law  farm Cantey and 
Hangar, LLP. See Exhibit 1. 
 5. Respondent’s answer and motion to consolidate are an attempt to subvert the relief the 
children desperately need, and failed to argue as to how these pleadings are in the best interests of the children. 
A. Sudden Activity after Months of Delay 
6. Respondent’s Answer asserts the existence of a prior divorce case (Cause No. 322-
744263-23) involving the parties as a basis to delay or abate this Suit Affecting Parent -Child 
Relationship (SAPCR). However, that divorce case has been stalled for months with no 
meaningful action by Respondent or her alleged counsel. Respondent’s counsel has failed to 
diligently prosecute the divorce matter, and a dormant case cannot justify stalling this separate SAPCR proceeding. In short, the children’s issues should not be put on hold due to an unrelated divorce case that remains inactive.  
B. SAPCR Suit Focus (Lack of Child- Related Response)  
7. This SAPCR is focused on the welfare and best interests of the children, yet the 
Respondent’s Original Answer is devoid of any substantive response regarding the children. Respondent merely states that the information required under Texas Family Code §§154.181(b) and 154.1815 “will be provided at a later date” and then enters a general denial. No specific M.1958 M.1958
M.1958 M.1958 M.1958 M.1958

3 
 conservatorship, support, or visitation issues are addressed at all. By failing to engage with the 
core child -related allegations in the Petition, Respondent’s Answer is irrelevant to the central 
issues of this proceeding and provides the Court with nothing of substance on the SAPCR matter s. 
8. Respondent’s Answer claims that it was “necessary for Respondent to secure the 
services of COOPER L. CARTER, a licensed attorney, to prepare and defend this suit”. Yet the 
pleading was filed under the letterhead of Marx, Altman & Johnson  (Attorney Roderick D. 
Marx’s firm) and is electronically signed by Cooper L. Carter as “Attorney for Respondent”. This inconsistency creates confusion as to who represents  Respondent in this case. Texas practice 
expects clarity in counsel of record (see Tex. R. Civ. P. 8 requiring designation of lead counsel), but here Respondent’s Answer sends mixed signals by invoking Mr. Carter’s name and services while being filed through Mr. Marx’s firm. Such a contradiction in representation is procedurally improper and fails to clearly identify the attorney in charge of Respondent’s case. 
9. In addition to the above, there are irregularities in the manner Respondent’s Answer 
was filed. Upon information and belief, the Answer was submitted via an Electronic Filing Manager (EFM) account registered to Cooper L. Carter under the law firm Cantey & Hanger , 
which is not the firm appearing on the pleading. In other words, the electronic filing credentials used do not match the law firm or attorney officially listed on the document. This raises serious concerns about the validity of the filing and compliance with Texas e-filing rules (see Tex. R. Civ. P. 21(f)). Filings must be made by the attorney of record under their proper account for transparency and proper notice. Using an EFM account associated with a different firm (Cantey & Hanger) for a pleading filed under Marx, Altman & Johnson’s banner is a procedural anomaly that calls into question whether Respondent’s Answer was filed in accordance with the required M.1959 M.1959

  procedur es.  F urther, t he email addr ess COOPERCARTER@MAJADMIN.COM associated w ith 
the pleadings filed in this court is NOT registered under the EFM in which they were filed. 
10. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 21(f) requires that electronic ﬁlings be made through 
an authorized EFM account corresponding to the attorney of record. The use of an account 
registered u nder one ﬁrm (Cantey & Hanger) t o ﬁle pleadings u nder a different ﬁrm’s name ( Marx, 
Altman & J ohnson) c onstitutes a p rocedural violation, undermining t he validity of the ﬁling and 
raising concerns about whether the attorney of record actually authorized or executed the ﬁling.  
11. This discrepancy calls into question the legitimacy of Respondent’s Answer and 
warrants immediate review by the Court. Given the attorney filing the document did not  use 
their ow n credentials under w hich the pl eading w as submitted, ye t claimed he r indi vidual 
services w ere necessary, renders the filing  as procedurally de fective  and shoul d be s truck 
from  the record sua sponte. 
PRAYER FOR RELIEF  
12. Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court strike Respondent’s Original Answer 
and motion to consolidate in its entirety sua sponte. Petitioner further requests that Respondent 
be required to refile any answer or responsive pleading in compliance with all applicable 
procedural rules – including proper attorney-of-record designation and use of correct electronic 
filing credentials – a nd to ensure that any such pleading addresses the substantive SAPCR issues 
regarding the children. Petitioner also prays for such other and further relief, at law or in equity , 
to which he may be justly entitled. 
13. WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Petitioner respectfully requests that
the Court strike Respondent’s Original Answer and Motion to Consolidate in its entirety as M.1960 M.1960

IN THE 233RD DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY , TEXAS  
TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THE 233rd DISTRICT COURT : 
1.For the preceding twelve months and fourteen days, Petitioner has been unlawfully
Barred from entering his residence and has been cut out of his children’s lives . On March 6th,  
2024, while walking M.E.M and C.R.M. to school, Respondent unlawfully locked the Petitioner 
out of the matrimonial home and called the Watauga police depar tment who came to assist in the 
dispute. When on scene a t 6641 Anne Court, Watauga , Texas 76148, Respondent produced an 
agreed associate judge’s report where consent had been withdrawn and use d it a s a means to bar 
the Petitioner ’s entry to the home. With a n emergency hearing date set for March 14th, 2024, the 
Petitioner took the advice of the officers and stayed with his father temporarily in Flower Mound, Texas  to avoid unnecessary  conflict.   
2. On March 14
th, 2024, the Petitioner appeared in person and was served a reduced copy
of the orders he was in court to challenge and from which he withdrew his consent from. Despite IN RE: M.E.M.,  C.R.M, .

 this, the orders were rendered anyway , effectively barring the Petitioner from his own home and 
Children’ s live s despite his consent not being present at the time of rendition.  
 3. The orders in question, attached hereto as EXHIBIT 1 , are facially void and lack legal 
effect. Despite this, they continue to cause ongoing and irreparable harm, as further detailed 
below. Accordingly, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court issue a declaratory judgment formally recognizing the invalidity of these orders whi ch will simultaneously provide long-
overdue relief to the children in this matter. In support of this request, the Petitioner shows as follows: 
I. STATEMENT OF FACTS  
 4. On page 1 of the orders, they  read  as follows: “The parties have agreed to the terms of 
this order as evidenced by the signatures below.”  5. On the final page of the orders, the signatures of CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS and his 
previous attorney, DAN BACALIS, are not present on the document.  6. The Petitioner refused to sign the orders to which he did not consent to on March 14
th, 
2024.  7. The orders were rendered on March 26
th, 2024, as an agreement between the parties 
despite consent not being present at the time of rendition . 
 8. The order s are void ab initio and  have no legal effect.  
II. ARGUMENT  
A. An “Agreed” Order Without Actual Consent is Void Ab Initio  
9. Texas law is unequivocal that a judgment purporting to rest on an agreement of the 
parties cannot be rendered or enforced if one of the parties did not genuinely consent at the time of rendition. The consent of all parties at the time the court renders judgment is a prerequisite for M.1968 M.1968
M.1968 M.1968 M.1968 M.1968

3 
 a valid agreed order.  As the Texas Supreme Court has stated, a trial court cannot render a valid 
agreed judgment absent the consent of the parties at the time it is rendered , and the 
agreement can be revoked at any time before judgment is rendered on the agreement.  S & A 
Restaurant Corp. v. Leal , 892 S.W.2d 855, 857 (Tex.1995). This is so because a trial court cannot 
render a valid agreed judgment absent the consent of the parties at the time it is rendered. Padilla 
v. LaFrance , 907 S.W.2d 454, 461 (Tex.1995).  
10. In S&A Restaurant Corp. v. Leal , the Court reaffirmed that a party may revoke 
consent to a settlement at any time before judgment is rendered, and if a court nonetheless signs a judgment after consent has been revoked, “a judgment rendered after one party revokes his consent is void .” This rule reflects a fundamental principle: t rue consent  is the linchpin of any 
agreed order.  
11. Here, Petitioner never consented to the order  at the time they were entered. Indeed, 
his missing signature is a prima facie showing of this fact.  Under these circumstances, it was 
error for the Court to sign the order as an “agreed” judgment , and the result is that the order 
is void ab initio. The Texas Supreme Court’s decision in Quintero v. Jim Walter Homes, Inc., 654 S.W.2d 442 (Tex. 1983) is directly on point. In Quintero, the Court held that when a trial court has knowledge that one party does not consent to a judgment, the court “should refuse to sanction [the] agreement by making it the judgment of the court.”  Id. By entering an order in 
the absence of Petitioner’s consent, the agreed judgment in this case was not just voidable—it is absolutely void from inception . In legal effect, there never was a valid temporary order at all, 
because the requisite meeting of the minds was absent. 
12. Texas courts of appeals have applied these principles in situations analogous to 
Petitioner’s, particularly in family law cases. For example, in In re E.B. , No. 12-17-00214- CV M.1969 M.1969
M.1969 M.1969 M.1969 M.1969

4 
 (Tex. App.—Tyler Oct. 18, 2017) , the trial court had entered temporary orders incorporating a 
Rule 11 settlement agreement regarding conservatorship and possession of children. The father, 
however, had timely revoked his consent to that agreement. The Tyler Court of Appeals held that because the father withdrew consent before judgment, the agreed terms regarding conservatorship and possession were void . The appellate court unequivocally stated that the 
provisions of the temporary orders involving the children “ are void, and the trial court abused 
its discretion in entering temporary orders based on the [purported] Agreement .” The court 
conditionally granted mandamus and directed the trial judge to vacate those portions of the temporary order.  B. A Void Judgment is a Nullity and Can Be Challenged or Vacated at Any Time 
13. Because the temporary orders were entered without jurisdiction (i.e. without consent 
jurisdiction conferred by the parties’ agreement), the resulting “agreed” order is void. Under Texas law, a void judgment or order has no legal force or effect from the ou tset. It is “null” ab 
initio, and any person or court affected by it is entitled to treat it as a nullity . The Texas Supreme 
Court has explained that a void order is, in effect, no order at all: “[A] void judgment is a legal 
nullity . . . .”  Alanis v. Barclays Capital Real Estate Inc., No. 04-17-00069-CV (Tex. App. Mar. 
27, 2017).  
14. Such a judgment may be collaterally attacked and set aside at any time, as it is not 
subject to ordinary procedural bars. Browning v. Placke , 698 S.W.2d 362 (Tex. 1985) (per 
curiam), is instructive on this point. In Browning, the Supreme Court recognized that courts of equal jurisdiction have the authority to declare a judgment void when it suffers from a fundamental defect (such as lack of jurisdiction or lack of consent). Here, this is a direct fit with the present situation.  M.1970 M.1970
M.1970 M.1970 M.1970 M.1970

5 
 C. Respondent’ s most recent attempt to subvert the process  
 15. On March 20th, 2025, Respondent filed an original answer and motion to consolidate 
through COOPER L. CARTER, which was prepared by RODERICK MARX. These filings are a 
direct showing of the Respondent’s game. She remains silent for months, and then at the first 
sign of her false narrative being under attack, she unleashes her attorney to file pleadings using the EFM Credentials of another individual not named in the suit – Roderick Marx – to prevent the relief duly entitled to Petitioner.  
 16. Petitioner reminds this c ourt that Respondent’s answer is clearly a boilerplate 
response te mplate that d oesn’t even address  the core issues raised in the SAPCR . The first lines 
of the Response claim that Respondent has no driver’s license or social security number, which shows the rushed nature of her pleading in an attempt to defend the Respondent’ s false narrative 
she has procured through fraud.  17. Petitioner also points out that the Respondent wants to consolidate this matter with the divorce matter that is procedurally defunct, which would not be in the best interests of the children  because it would move the matter back to the procedu rally stalled case that hasn ’t bene 
prosecuted by the same attorney who is requesting consolidation. Such would defeat the entire purpose of this suit, and would cause undue delay and prejudice the children and Petitioner. D. Request for immediate re -entry.  
 18. Given the orders in question are facially void, Petitioner requests an immediate notice 
to be filed and served on the parties of record so that he may return home to his children, residence, and place of business until this matter can be set for a hearing. Petitioner ’s unlawful 
exclusion from his residence creates further harm to the children  each day it is left unaddressed. M.1971 M.1971
M.1971 M.1971 M.1971 M.1971

6 
  19. Petitioner r eiterates that his immediate return is in line with Texas Public Policy, 
nobody has argued a gainst his relief sought, and this court has the discretion to issue temporary 
orders and dispense without the necessity of a bond or verified pleading pursuant to TEX. FAM. 
CODE. 1 05.001.  
 20. Preventing a father from accessing his home whi ch is needed for financial stability 
will continue to cause monetary and emotional damage to the children until resolved. 
PRAYER FOR EXPEDITED RELIEF  
WHEREFORE, promises considered, Petitioner respectfully request of this court 
without delay: 
1. To declare the orders attached as Exhibit 1 void ab initio  and issue findings 
permitting the Petitioner to return home  to 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 
76148 immediately  for the orders lacking consent of all parties at the time of 
rendition and for not bearing the Petitioner’s signature. 
2. To serve on all parties of record confirmation that the orders are without legal effect . 
3. Enforce the Texas Rules of Civil Pro cedure and prevent Cooper L. Carter 
from representing the Respondent in this matter until s he can conform to 
electronic filing requirements and strike her pleadings outright. 
4. Any further relief that the court de ems just and equitable.  
5. Given the extraordinary circumstances, set this motion for hearing at the earliest possible time, to be conducted via zoom if possible f or judicial 
efficiency  given the Petitioner’s financial strain caused by this situation.

The analysis concludes that:  
1. The divorce case should be dismissed for want of prosecution due to Petitioner's failure 
to advance the case for nearly a year  
2. The current orders are void due to lack of consent and improper adoption by the referring court 
3. The 322nd District Court never acquired continuing exclusive jurisdiction over the children  
4. The new SAPCR was properly filed as an original proceeding and should not be consolidated, especially  considering no motion to transfer has been filed. 
5. Ms. Carter's pleadings should be stricken due to her failure to respond to a Rule 12 challenge  
6. The children's best interests require immediate relief without further procedural delays

II. LEGAL ANALYSIS  
A. Dismissal for Want of Prosecution 
Legal Framework 
1. Texas courts have authority to dismiss cases for want of prosecution under both Texas 
Rule of Civil Procedure 165a and the court's inherent power to manage its docket. The Texas 
Supreme Court recognized both bases for dismissal in Villarreal v. San Antonio Truck & Equipment , 994 S.W.2d 628 (Tex. 1999). M.1980 M.1980
M.1980 M.1980 M.1980 M.1980

2. A party seeking affirmative relief has a duty to prosecute the case with due diligence. 
As stated in  In re Conner , 458 S.W.3d 532 (Tex. 2015) , “[t]he issue here is whether a trial court 
abuses its discretion by refusing to grant a motion to dismiss for want of prosecution in the face 
of unmitigated and unexplained delay. We hold that it does.” Id.  
3. In family law specifically, In re Marriage of Buster , 115 S.W.3d 141 (Tex. App.—
Texarkana 2003) emphasized the importance of moving family law cases toward resolution and upheld dismissal after extended inactivity.  
Application to Current Case 
4. The facts strongly support dismissal for want of prosecution: 
i. The divorce case has been pending for over 16 months 
ii. Petitioner's attorney has failed to prosecute the case since April 24, 2024 
iii. No substantive action taken for approximately 11 months 
iv. No responses to discovery, no substantive pleadings, no trial settings 
v. The only recent action was filing a Motion to Consolidate to block emergency relief  
5. This extended inactivity is precisely the type of conduct that Texas courts have 
consistently held, which justifies dismissal for want of prosecution. The court should dismiss the dormant divorce case and allow the new SAPCR to proceed independently to address the children's urgent needs. 
 M.1981 M.1981
M.1981 M.1981 M.1981 M.1981

B. Void Orders Due to Lack of Consent  
Legal Framework 
6. The Texas Supreme Court established in Burnaman v. Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 
(Tex. 1951) that: "A valid consent judgment cannot be rendered by a court when consent of one 
of the parties is wanting. It is not sufficient to support the judgment that a party's consent thereto may at one time have been given; consent must exist at the very moment the court undertakes to make the agreement the judgment of the court." 
7. The Court further held: "When a trial court has knowledge that one of the parties to a 
suit does not consent to a judgment, it is error to render a judgment purportedly by agreement; such a judgment is a nullity." 
8. This principle was reaffirmed in Padilla v. LaFrance , 907 S.W.2d 454 (Tex. 1995), 
which confirmed that a trial court cannot render an agreed judgment after a party has withdrawn consent to a settlement.  
Application to Current Case 
9. The orders in this case are void under Burnaman and its progeny because: 
i. The orders claim consent of all parties but only bear signatures of the Petitioner and counsel 
ii. Respondent contends he never gave consent to the orders 
iii. Respondent actively opposed the terms that locked him out of his home and separated him from the children M.1982 M.1982
M.1982 M.1982 M.1982 M.1982

iv. The court was aware of the dispute regarding consent (Respondent filed an 
emergency motion challenging the basis for agreement) 
10. Under Texas law, if Respondent did not consent to the orders at the time they were 
rendered, they are void ab initio. The court should declare these orders void and vacate them. 
C. Associate Judge's Orders Never Properly Adopted  
Legal Framework 
11. Texas Family Code § 201.013(b) explicitly states: "Except as provided by Section 
201.007 (Powers of Associate Judge), if a request for a de novo hearing before the referring court 
is not timely filed, the proposed order or judgment of the associate judge b ecomes the order or 
judgment of the referring court only on the referring court's signing the proposed order or judgment ." 
12. This requirement is mandatory, not discretionary. Without the District Judge's 
signature, the Associate Judge's order remains merely a "proposed" order. 
Application to Current Case 
13. The orders in this case were issued by an Associate Judge but allegedly never 
properly adopted or signed by the referring District Court. Under Texas Family Code § 
201.013(b), these orders never achieved the status of a final judgment of the court and have no legal effect as final orders.  
14. This defect alone would be sufficient to challenge their validity, even without the 
consent issues. The court should declare these orders void or vacate them due to the lack of proper adoption by the referring court. M.1983 M.1983
M.1983 M.1983 M.1983 M.1983

D. No Continuing Exclusive Jurisdiction (CEJ) 
Legal Framework 
15. Texas Family Code § 155.001(a) provides: "A court acquires continuing, exclusive 
jurisdiction over the matters provided for by this title in connection with a child on the rendition 
of a final order." 
16. Critically, § 155.001(d) states: "Unless a final order has been rendered by a court of 
continuing, exclusive jurisdiction, a subsequent suit shall be commenced as an original proceeding." 
17. In In re Burk , 252 S.W.3d 736 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2008), the court held 
that CEJ is established only upon rendition of a final order, and temporary orders do not establish CEJ.  
Application to Current Case 
18. No final order was ever rendered in the divorce case because:  
i. The Associate Judge's orders were never properly signed by the referring District Court Judge (per § 201.013(b)) 
ii. The orders were void due to lack of consent (per Burnaman v. Heaton) 
19. Without a final order, the 322nd District Court never acquired CEJ over the children. 
Therefore, under § 155.001(d), the Respondent's new SAPCR was properly "commenced as an original proceeding" in the 233rd District Court. 
20. The motion to consolidate should be denied because the 322nd District Court does 
not have dominant jurisdiction over the children. M.1984 M.1984
M.1984 M.1984 M.1984 M.1984

E. Exceptions to Dominant Jurisdiction 
Legal Framework 
           21. Generally, when two suits involving the same subject matter are pending in different 
courts of equal jurisdiction, the court in which the suit was first filed has dominant jurisdiction. However, the Texas Supreme Court in Wyatt v. Shaw Plumbing Co., 760 S.W.2d 245, 247 (Tex. 1988) recognized three exceptions to this rule: 
i. Conduct by a party that estops them from asserting prior active jurisdiction 
ii. Lack of persons to be joined if feasible 
iii. Lack of intent to prosecute the first lawsuit 
Application to Current Case 
         22. Even if the 322nd District Court had dominant jurisdiction (which it does not due to 
lack of CEJ), at least two exceptions to the first-filed rule apply: 
Estoppel by Conduct:  
i. Petitioner allowed the case to become completely dormant  
ii. Failed to comply with Rule 237a's notice requirements after federal remand 
iii. Effectively concealed the revival of the state case  
iv. Represented through inaction that she had abandoned the case 
     Lack of Intent to Prosecute:  
i. For nearly a year, Petitioner took no action to advance the divorce M.1985 M.1985
M.1985 M.1985 M.1985 M.1985

ii. No discovery, no responses, no settings 
iii. Only "revived" the divorce case as a strategic ploy to derail Respondent's 
emergency action  
23. The 233rd District Court is the appropriate forum to hear the current disputes because 
that case was initiated specifically to address the children's urgent needs, free from the entanglements of the stalled divorce. 
F. Attorney Misconduct - Rule 12 Challenge 
Legal Framework 
24. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 12 provides that a party may file a sworn motion 
stating that they believe a suit is being prosecuted or defended without authority. The challenged 
attorney bears the burden of proving authority to act. If the attorney fails to show authority, the court "shall refuse to permit the attorney to appear in the cause and  shall strike the pleadings if 
no person who is authorized to prosecute or defend appears." 
25. These consequences are mandatory, not discretionary. The court has no choice but to 
bar the attorney and strike the pleadings upon failure to show authority. 
Application to Current Case 
26. Respondent filed a verified Rule 12 motion on September 20, 2024, challenging 
Cooper L. Carter's authority. Ms. Carter has not responded to this challenge for over 6 months. 
Additional facts supporting the Rule 12 challenge include: 
i. Ms. Carter's e -filing account is registered under her prior employer's email 
address  M.1986 M.1986
M.1986 M.1986 M.1986 M.1986

ii. Ms. Carter has not meaningfully corresponded with Respondent during the 
litigation  
iii. Ms. Carter is unreachable by phone or email 
iv. Ms. Carter lacks a current working phone number or email on file with the State Bar 
v. Ms. Carter has not produced any client authority or engagement agreement in 14 months 
27. Under Rule 12, Ms. Carter's failure to respond to the challenge requires the court to 
refuse to permit her to appear in the case and strike all pleadings filed by her, including the 
Motion to Consolidate. 
G. Additional Attorney Misconduct  
 
Discovery Violations 
28. Ms. Carter failed to respond to Requests for Admissions served on September 17, 
2024, resulting in deemed admissions under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 198. She made no 
effort to withdraw or amend these deemed admissions, effectively conceding critical fa cts against 
her client.  
29. This constitutes a violation of her duties under Rules 193.2 and 193.5 to timely 
respond or amend discovery responses. 
 M.1987 M.1987
M.1987 M.1987 M.1987 M.1987

Rule 237a Violations 
30. After federal remand on December 6, 2024, Ms. Carter failed to:  
i. File the required certified copy of the remand order with the clerk 
ii. Provide Respondent with mandatory written notice of the remand 
31. This procedural violation prevents the case from moving forward properly and further 
demonstrates Ms. Carter's neglect of basic procedural duties.  
Abuse of Process  
31. Ms. Carter's sudden reappearance after nearly a year of inactivity solely to block 
emergency relief suggests improper purpose. Filing a Motion to Consolidate without addressing 
substantive issues appears designed to delay resolution rather than advance the case.  
This conduct violates: 
i. Rule 13 of Texas Rules of Civil Procedure (forbidding groundless filings brought in bad faith) 
ii. Texas Disciplinary Rule 3.02 (prohibiting positions that unreasonably delay resolution) 
H. Children's Best Interests  
Legal Framework 
32. Texas Family Code § 153.002 establishes: "The best interest of the child shall be the 
primary consideration of the court in determining the issues of conservatorship and possession of and access to the child." M.1988 M.1988
M.1988 M.1988 M.1988 M.1988

This paramount standard must guide all decisions in cases involving children. 
Application to Current Case 
33. The children in this case are suffering ongoing harm: 
i. Subjected to psychological manipulation and medical neglect 
ii. Left home alone at night without supervision 
iii. Removed from Respondent's care and placed with elderly great-grandparents 
iv. Eldest child's academic performance has plummeted  
v. Emotionally estranged from both parents 
34. Every day that passes without corrective action leaves the children in an unstable, 
harmful environment. Consolidation would reward procedural stonewalling and cause further 
delay. The children's best interests require prompt resolution, which can only be achieved by denying consolidation, dismissing the dormant divorce case, and allowing the new SAPCR to proceed expeditiously. 
III. CONCLUSION AND RELIEF REQUESTED 
Based on the comprehensive legal analysis above, there are multiple independent grounds 
supporting the Respondent's entitlement to relief: 
1. The divorce case should be dismissed for want of prosecution under Rule 165a and the court's inherent power. 
2. The current orders are void due to lack of consent under Burnaman v. Heaton. M.1989 M.1989
M.1989 M.1989 M.1989 M.1989

3. The Associate Judge's orders were never properly adopted under Texas Family Code § 
201.013(b). 
4. The 322nd District Court never acquired CEJ under Texas Family Code § 155.001. 
5. Exceptions to dominant jurisdiction apply under Wyatt v. Shaw Plumbing Co. 
6. Ms. Carter's pleadings should be stricken due to her failure to respond to a Rule 12 challenge. 
7. Ms. Carter has engaged in multiple instances of misconduct warranting sanctions and referral to the State Bar . 
8. The children's best interests require immediate relief without further procedural delays  
Therefore, the Respondent is entitled to the following relief:  
i. Denial of Petitioner's Motion to Consolidate. 
ii. Declaration that the current orders are void and of no legal effect. 
iii. Dismissal of the divorce action (Cause No. 322-744263-23) for want of prosecution. 
iv. Striking of all pleadings filed by Cooper L. Carter due to her failure to show authority. 
v. Permission for the new SAPCR to proceed in the 233rd District Court to address the children's urgent needs. 
These remedies are supported by well -established Texas law and are necessary to protect the 
children's best interests, ensure procedural fairness, and maintain the integrity of the legal process.  Without any opposition, the court has every ability to act. M.1990 M.1990

IN THE 233RD DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY , TEXAS  
 
 
TO THE HONORABLE COURT:  
 Petitioner, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, submits this notice to provide a different 
perspective into the current situation: 
I. BEFORE AND AFTER 
1. This side -by-side comparison illustrates the stark differences in the children’s 
quality of life, parental involvement, and household stability before  and after  the removal of 
the Father from the family home.  It presents a clear, fact -based evaluation of how the familial 
environment, care structure, and overall wellbeing of the children have been significantly 
impacted. Each point demonstrates a substantial decline in stability, support, and morality—raising urgent concerns about the children’s best interests, safety, and development under the current arrangement .

 M.1999 M.1999
M.1999 M.1999 M.1999 M.1999

5 
 V.  ACTIONS  
5. The motives can be established from the following actions derived from the clerk’s 
record within the pleadings: 
MOTHER                  FATHER  
• Fabricated a narrative of family 
violence.  • Spent time with the children over the 
holidays. 
• Hired an attorney to defend herself, 
not represent the children’s best 
interests.  • Hired an attorney to defend his 
children’s best interests and terminated him when he failed.  
• Only communicates with her 
extramarital partner.  • Can only communicate with the 
children via an online videogame chatroom. 
• Convinces the children the divorce is 
final so her new relationship appears morally justifiable.  • Has relentlessly sought relief to 
restore the children’s status quo. 
• Has offered nothing of substance 
regarding the children. • Has provided everything to the court 
regarding the children. 
• Asked for sole use of the residency to 
pursue her new relationship. • Asked for time to ensure the children 
are not affected by unnecessary, abrupt changes.  
• Lied to the court to remove Father to 
pursue her new relationship. • Forced to live in alternative housing 
during the pendency of the case, business income destroyed. M.2000 M.2000

 • Lied to the court and falsified her 
indigency, then sticks Father with the 
car payments she claimed to pay for. • Financial strain leads to one of the 
vehicles being repossessed, credit score plummets.  
• Sat dormant for months only to block 
emergency relief in a separate SAPCR suit. • Opened a separate SAPCR suit to 
escape the procedurally defunct divorce to obtain relief for the children. 
 
 6. All the above can be established through the numerous exhibits that have been 
provided to the opposing side. After nearly twelve months of silence, there has been no objection, argument, opposition, or response offered for the exhibits given. More critically, there has been no response, opposition, or argument offered regarding the relief being sought from the Petitioner, which is simply to return to the residence that he was unlawfully removed from so that he can begin rebuilding the status quo of the children. Finally, we compare the benefits versus the detriments if granting relief to Petitioner: 
VI. BENEFITS VERSUS DETRIMENTS  OF GRANTING RELIEF  
BENEFITS                   DETRIMENTS  
• Children will have a parent active in 
their daily life  as opposed to none. • The respondent  will have to  choose 
between her extramarital relationship 
or working towards the divorce. M.2001 M.2001
M.2001 M.2001 M.2001 M.2001

 • Children will have help with 
homework from home and help 
preparing for STAR Testing. • The respondent will have to choose 
between co -habitation or reside in an 
alternate residence near -by. 
• Children will have frequent and 
continuous access to both parents.  
• Financial damages can be repaired.   
 
VII. CONCLUSION 
 This situation is destructive, and truly a one- sided case. Respondent’s prolonged silence, 
in fact, says everything. Without any arguments or opposition on record, it begs the question as to how this situation has been permitted to persist as long as it has. The only drawbacks of granting relief fall on the Respondent – and are minor inconveniences at best that can neve r 
outweigh the benefits that the children would reap if relief were to be granted. All the Petitioner asked for in the beginning was time. N ow, time has been wasted, and we remain in the same 
spot. The point is – the Mother cannot just fabricate family violence to have Father removed from the home – especially when she knew and benefitted from his at-home business operations which have since been significantly damaged. Despite all the harm done, the Petitioner is confident that it can be repaired, the family  can get back on track, and this process can be finalized without sacrificing the stability and well-being of the children that they have been accustomed to throughout their lives.

Respondent , CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, submits his NOTICE OF INTENT TO  
SEEK AN EXTRAORDINARY WRIT OF PROHIBITION, and in support thereof, sho ws the 
following: 
I.INTRODUCTION
After over a year of one-side d litigation, this court has permitted a purported settlement 
agreement to destroy the lives of two children, their father’s  livelihood, and have rewarded both 
the Petitioner  and her attorney by refusing to prosecute the case. There  is no excuse f or allowing 
the Petitioner to blatantly deceive this court into acquiring  agreed temporary orders without the 
consent of all parties through her attorney of record only to then fail to prosecute the case. This 
situation has resulted  in unenforceable orders that remain facially void  and now this court, after ITMOMO

THOMAS A. WILDER
DISTRICT CLERKM.2006 M.2006
M.2006 M.2006 M.2006 M.2006

2 
 months of inaction, is seeking to set an improperly filed consolidation motion used as a tactic to 
stall emergency relief . 
Notably, the participation from P etitioner  resurfaces again only in the face of an 
emergency TRO . It doesn ’t come with good faith or arguments; it only comes with a false sense 
of urgency by the opposing counsel in this matter. This court has sat on its’ hands for months, 
and then despite the failure to prosecute from the other side, it chooses to act on the wrong motion . Such a display is legally improper, unjustified, and showcases the complete disregard for 
what would otherwise be a prima facie case wa rranting dismissal for want of prosecution.  
Now, rather than acting sua sponte  to set the DWOP for hearing, t he court instead 
chooses to entertain a prematurely  filed consolidation motion which it has no  jurisdiction to rule 
on. As the  Texas  Supreme Court has held  previously: “ [a] plaintiff has a duty to “prosecut[e] the 
suit to a conclusion with reasonable diligence,” failing which a trial court may dismiss for want of prosecution.” In re Conner , 458 S.W.3d 532 (Tex. 2015) ( citing Callahan v. Staples , 139 Tex. 
8, 161 S.W.2d 489, 491 (1942) ). The court has wide discretion to manage its ’ docket, so it begs 
the question as to why the court wants to act on its own accord on a motion to consolidate be fore 
the case is  properly transferred . 
Although the writ of prohibition is intended to prevent this Court from setting a matter 
for hearing that is procedurally improper, the issue in this case mirrors that addressed by the Texas Supreme Court in In re Conner , 458 S.W.3d 532 (Tex. 2015). There, the Court considered 
whether a trial court abuses its discretion by refusing to grant a motion to dismiss for want of prosecution in the face of unmitigated and unexplained delay—and held that it does. That is precisely  the circumstance presented here, and this intended writ of prohibition is to prevent this 
court from causing even further delays by setting a matter for a hearing which it ha s no M.2007 M.2007
M.2007 M.2007 M.2007 M.2007

3 
 jurisdiction to rule on, and give the court the ability to dismiss this case for want of prosecution  
given that it has the discretion to do so, and no opposition to it from the opposing party. 
II. LEGAL  FRAMEWORK 
A. Writ of Prohibition 
A writ of prohibition is an extraordinary legal remedy that serves specific, limited 
purposes in the Texas legal system. It is a judicial order issued by a higher court to prevent a 
lower court from exceeding its jurisdiction or interfering with the higher court's determination of a case.  
Key characteristics of a writ of prohibition include: 
1. Limited Purpose Remedy : A writ of prohibition is used to protect the subject matter of 
an appeal or to prohibit unlawful interference with enforcement of a superior court's judgment ( Sivley v. Sivley, 972 S.W.2d 850, 863, Tex. App.—Tyler 1998). 
2. Preventive Nature: The writ is designed to prevent future actions, not to remedy acts already completed. It can only be used to prevent what is about to be or could be done, not as a remedy for acts that are already completed (United States v. Hoffman, 71 U.S. 158, 1866). Here, Respondent seeks to use this writ as a means to prevent the court f rom 
causing further delays by setting opposing counsel’s improper motion to consolidate. 
3. Extraordinary Remedy : Courts have characterized a writ of prohibition as a "drastic 
remedy" and the legal equivalent of an equitable injunction ( In re Lewis , 223 S.W.3d 756, 
761, Tex. App.—Texarkana 2007). This is a drastic circumstance. The Respondent has M.2008 M.2008
M.2008 M.2008 M.2008 M.2008

4 
 been barred from his own residence for over a year without any explanation, and without 
any case prosecution in a one-sided effort  to obtain relief from facially void orders. 
4. Last Resort : Prohibition is not appropriate if any other remedy, such as appeal, is 
available and adequate ( In re Castle Tex. Prod. Ltd. P'ship, 189 S.W.3d 400, 404, Tex. 
App.—Tyler 2006). Here, Respondent has no adequate remedy by appeal, because there is currently no court with continuous, exclusive jurisdiction over the children in this matter.  
III. STATEMENT OF FACTS  
5. On January 24, 2025, after more than 11 months of inaction, Petitioner  filed a Motion 
to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution in this court . The divorce case has had  no substantive action 
from Petitioner  since April 2024, a legal ghost ship drifting without direction or purpose. That 
motion wasn’t attempted to be set for hearing until September of 2024, only after the Respondent exhausted all efforts seeking relief throughout the Texas Judiciary without any participation from the opposing side. 
6. On March 19, 2025, driven by mounting concerns about the children’s welfare and 
learning that the 322
nd District Court did not have continuous, exclusive jurisdiction over the 
children in this matter , Petitioner  filed a new SAPCR in the 233rd District Court (Cause No. 233-
765358-25) seeking emergency relief for the children. The very next day, March 20, 2025, Ms. Carter suddenly reappeared like a character presumed missing  in the second act, filing an answer 
to the SAPCR petition in this Court and thereby submitting to this Court’s jurisdiction by filing a 
response rather than a motion to abate. M.2009 M.2009
M.2009 M.2009 M.2009 M.2009

5 
 7. On March 21, 2025, Respondent filed a verified Rule 12 motion challenging Ms. 
Carter’s  authority  in the 233rd to represent Petitioner  in the matter —the second such challenge, 
met with the same resounding silence as the first.  
8. On March 25, 2025, Respondent filed an Objection to Consolidation and an Ex- Parte 
Emergency Motion for TRO in the 233rd. Two days later, on March 27, 2025, Respondent 
contacted the court coordinator, requested a date and time to present the motion, and served  the 
documents to the opposing party with the intent to present on March 28, 2025, at 9:00 A.M. before the Associate Judge of this Court. On that fateful morning of March 28, 2025, Respondent drove to the courthouse, paid for parking, met with the coordinator, communicated with opposing counsel, and secured a hearing date of April 10, 2025 agreed by the parties . 
Respondent then proceeded to the Associate Judge’s courtroom to present the TRO. 
9. Before Respondent could present his case—before he could speak a single word about 
his children’s welfare—he  was told that Ms. Carter would be filing a motion to consolidate in the 
322nd District Court, that his motion was improperly before the 233
rd court, and the Associate 
Judge refused to hear the motion. It was a curious thing, this refusal. Ms. Carter wasn’t even present in the courtroom, yet her words carried more weight than Respondent’s physical presence,  his properly filed papers, and most importantly, the urgent needs of his children. She 
stopped the proceedings with nothing more than word of mouth for the incorrect motion. A true showcasing of disregard for the process, and the children. 
10. On April 2, 2025, Respondent filed a Pre-Objection to Motion to Consolidate in the 
322
nd District Court. Ms. Carter’s motion to consolidate wasn’t filed with the 322nd District 
Court until April 3, 2025, six days after she used its mere possibility to  prevent the 233rd Court M.2010 M.2010
M.2010 M.2010 M.2010 M.2010

6 
 from hearing Respondent’s emergency motion. Her motion disregarded  Respondent’s pre -
objection entirely, as if it were invisible ink on the page. 
11. On April 4, 2025, unable to acquire a ruling due to Respondent’s objection, Ms. 
Carter  attempted to set the motion for a hearing before the 322nd District Court. That same day, 
Respondent filed a Pre-Objection to Motion to Transfer in the 233rd Court, given that  a motion 
to transfer must come before any attempt at consolidation. Ms. Carter, who had been so urgently 
concerned about consolidation when it served to block Respondent’s emergency hearing, suddenly claimed to be unavailable until late April —causing significant delays that could have 
been avoided had the 233rd Court simply heard the motion before it on March 28, 2025. 
12. Throughout this period of procedural maneuvering, the children have been  subjected 
to psychological manipulation and medical neglect. They have been removed from Petitioner’s  
care and placed with elderly great -grandparents on a daily basis, and are being gaslighted into a 
false belief that the  divorce is finalized. Respondent’s eldest child’s academic performance has 
plummeted,  and both children have become emotionally estranged from both parents. 
Respondent has  suffered approximately $110,500 in verifiable financial damages due to being 
locked out of his home and business, and it grows each day. But the financial toll pales in comparison to the emotional cost of watching Respondent’s children  suffer while the courts 
exchange procedural ly incorrect  volleys over his head.  
IV. THE PROHIBITION PREDICAMENT  
13. The writ of prohibition exists for precisely this sort of situation —where a court is 
about to act in a way that exceeds its authority and threatens to compound an already untenable situation. The law on this matter is as clear as a bell on a still morning:  
 M.2011 M.2011
M.2011 M.2011 M.2011 M.2011

7 
 A. The Procedural Parade Must Follow Its Proper Order 
14. The Texas Family Code establishes a clear sequence for the consolidation of cases 
from different courts. First, a motion to transfer must be filed and granted, bringing both cases 
into the same court. Only then may a motion to consolidate be considered. See Tex. Fam. Code §§ 155.201 and 6.407. 
15. This isn't merely a matter of dotting i's and crossing t's—it's the fundamental roadmap 
that ensures cases proceed in an orderly fashion. A court cannot consolidate what it does not possess, any more than a chef can cook ingredients that haven't yet been delivered to the kitchen. 
16. The Texas Supreme Court has consistently held that courts must follow proper 
procedural sequence. In re Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., 35 S.W.3d 602, 605 (Tex. 2000). When a court attempts to rule on a matter for which it lacks jurisdiction or authority, prohibition is the appropriate remedy . In re Lewis , 223 S.W.3d 756, 761 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2007, orig. 
proceeding). 
17. Respondent is no legal scholar with a library of case law memorized, but even he can 
see that this principle is as plain as a full moon on a cloudless night. This Court's potential willingness to hear a motion to consolidate before a motion to transfer has been filed and granted would be like a judge sentencing a defendant before the trial has begun— a clear inversion of the 
proper order of legal proceedings. 
B. The Discretion Dilemma  
18. The writ of prohibition as used in Texas has three functions:  1) preventing 
interference with higher courts in deciding a pending appeal, 2) preventing inferior courts from 
entertaining suits that will relitigate controversies which have already been settled by issuing M.2012 M.2012
M.2012 M.2012 M.2012 M.2012

8 
 courts, and 3) prohibiting a trial court's action when it affirmatively appears that the court lacks 
jurisdiction.  Texas Capital Bank-Westwood v. Johnson, 864 S.W.2d 186, 187 (Tex.App.-
Texarkana 1993, orig. proceeding). Here, function three is directly relevant. A court cannot hear a motion to consolidate a case it does not have before it.  
C. Opposing  Counsel's Conduct  
19. Ms. Carter's behavior throughout this saga deserves special attention, like a character 
in a novel whose actions consistently contradict their stated intentions. 
20. She abandoned the divorce case for nearly a year, filing nothing since April 2024, 
only to suddenly reappear when Respondent sought emergency relief for the children —like a 
firefighter who ignores a smoldering house for months, only to rush in when someone else calls 
for help. 
21. She filed an answer in the 233rd Court, thereby submitting to its jurisdiction, only to 
then argue that the case belongs in this Court—a contradiction as glaring as claiming to be both inside and outside a room simultaneously. 
22. She used the mere possibility of a future filing to block an emergency hearing, then 
waited six days to file  the motion —a delay that speaks volumes about the true urgency of the 
matter. 
23. She filed a motion to consolidate without first filing a motion to transfer, putting the 
procedural cart before the horse in a manner that defies both logic and law. M.2013 M.2013
M.2013 M.2013 M.2013 M.2013

9 
 24. She now claims to be unavailable until late April, creating further delay after using 
the urgency of consolidation to block Respondent’s emergency hearing —a scheduling 
contradiction that would be comical if not for the children caught in its web. 
25. This pattern reveals a tactical attempt to manipulate both courts' dockets to prevent 
me from obtaining timely relief. It's a shell game played with Respondent’s children's welfare as 
the prize. This Court should not allow itself to be used as an instrument in such procedural gamesmanship, particularly when children's lives hang in the balance. 
V.  MORAL  FIBER  
26. If there's a lesson to be drawn from this procedural quagmire, it's that the law's 
complexity should never obscure its fundamental purpose: to provide justice, particularly for those most vulnerable. My children—innocent bystanders in this adult conflict—have become collateral damage in a game of procedural chess where the rules seem to change with each move.  
27. It has been stated that the true measure of a society is found in how it treats its most 
vulnerable members. By that measure, the procedural labyrinth that has prevented the 233rd Court from hearing Respondent’s emergency motion, and now threatens to compound the error by having this Court act prematurely, speaks volumes about how far we have strayed from the ideal of justice.  
28. Respondent provide this notice not out of anger or vindictiveness, but out of that 
quiet, bewildered astonishment that settles in a person's bones when they've witnessed the law being twisted into shapes that would make a carnival contortionist blush with envy. Respondent followed the rules . He honored the procedures. He placed his faith in a system that promised 
justice would flow like water, clear and unobstructed, to those who seek it properly. M.2014 M.2014
M.2014 M.2014 M.2014 M.2014

10 
 29. Behind every case number, behind every filing, behind every procedural rule, there 
are real children with real lives that continue whether the courts act or not. Time doesn't stop for 
them while adults sort out procedural disagreements. They grow, they hur t, they form memories 
and impressions that will shape them for a lifetime.  
30. As Mark Twain might have observed, the difference between proper procedure and 
improper procedure is not merely academic—it's the difference between justice served and justice denied, between children protected and children neglected, between a system that works and one that merely pretends to. 
VI. CONCLUSION AND PRAYER  
31. I respectfully request that this Court pause, reflect on the procedural peculiarity 
before it, and decline to hear a motion to consolidate until the proper preliminary steps have been taken. Specifically, I ask that this Court: 
a. Recognize that it lacks jurisdiction to hear a motion to consolidate until a motion to transfer has been filed in the 233rd Court and granted; 
b. Take judicial notice that Petitioner submitted to the 233rd Court's jurisdiction by 
answering the SAPCR petition; 
c. Acknowledge the improper procedural sequence attempted by Petitioner's counsel in 
filing a motion to consolidate without first filing a motion to transfer; 
d. Consider that proceeding with a hearing on the consolidation motion would only 
compound the procedural irregularities and further delay relief for the children; 
 M.2015 M.2015
M.2015 M.2015 M.2015 M.2015

11 
 e. Recognize that the 233rd Court has the power and jurisdiction to address the 
emergency concerns raised in my TRO motion, which remains unopposed on the record. 
f. Using the court’s own inherent power, dismiss the divorce outright for failure to 
prose cute given the circumstances of this case.  
Respondent understands that in most situations, courts give deference to licensed attorneys over self-represented litigants. But the procedural impropriety here is so glaring, so fundamental, that 
it transcends the usual presumptions. Even a layperson can see that you cannot consolidate what you do not possess, just as you cannot serve a meal with ingredients you haven't yet purchased. 
The children deserve better than to have their fate determined by procedural sleight of hand. 
They deserve courts that follow the law's clear sequence, that prioritize substance over form, and that remember that behind every procedural rule are real lives hanging in the balance. The truth of this matter can  only be revealed once the injustices are duly corrected by this court. 
 Respondent has filed a similar notice to the 233
rd court informing of the intent to file a 
writ of mandamus to compel a ruling on the emergency TRO that w as un lawfully blocked from 
being heard by COOPER L. CARTER.

7. The Respondent cannot find alternative housing while being barred from being able to work. 
8. The Petitioner knows this to be true but instead sabotaged the Respondent’ s 
ability to provide for the children for the purpose of pursuing an extramarital  
relationship that began prior to the commencement of these proceedings. 
9. The Petitioner is now ENGAGED to DAMEN KAZLAUSKAS, who proposed to Petitioner in the presence of the children. 
10. There is no child support set up for the children. 
11. Petitioner continues to dispose of Respondent’s personal belongings. 
12. Desp ite her authority being in question, and despite her failure to prosecute, 
COOPER L. CARTER unilaterally inter rupted emergency proceedings on 
March 28, 2025, claiming that the case would be consolidated the following week  without being present in the courtroom. 
13. The 233
rd district court blatantly denied the Respondent due process in the 
face o f COOPER L. CARTER ’s false promise.  
14. COOPER L. CARTER doesn ’t know the law, because you cannot consolidate 
a SAPCR with a divorce matter unless the suit is transferred according to the TEXAS FAMILY CODE.  M.2021 M.2021
M.2021 M.2021 M.2021 M.2021

15. The court, at this point, is choosing to not grant relief despite having no reason 
to do so. 
16. This litigation has no possible means to an end, and it should be dismissed outright so that the SAPCR may continue. 
17. There has been no filed opposition, objection, or arguments made against the Respondent’s position in either suit.  
18. The Petitioner has wasted everyone’ s time, cau sed significant damage, and 
remains hidden in fear of being held accountable. 
19. The Petitioner prioritized an extramarital affair over prosecuting the divorce, and the children and Respondent have been signi ficantly harmed.  
Therefore, this case should be dismissed as a matter of law. Every day causes more 
irreparable harm, and this court has every abili ty an d reason to rectify this s ituation immediately.  
Respondent already has the solution and has been the only party in this matter seeking relief. It is simply unacceptable to permit this to co ntinue.

 Statement of the Case  
Nature of Underlying Proceeding: This original proceeding arises from a Suit 
Affecting the Parent -Child Relationship ("SAPCR") involving two minor children, 
M.E.M. and C.R.M., in which Relator filed an emergency ex parte application for 
temporary restraining order ("TRO") in the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County, Texas. The underlying SAPCR (Cause No. 233- 765358- 25) was a new proceeding 
initiated by Relator on March 19, 2025, and was answered on March 20, 2025. There is a related divorce matter (322 -744263- 23) that has not been prosecuted 
since April 24, 2024, and no final orders have been rendered.  Relator seeks 
declaratory and injunctive relief preventing the Real Party in Interest from barring Relator ’s from accessing his home, business, and children until valid orders are 
rendered that reflect the children’s best interests. 
Respondent Judge : The Respondent Judge, Kate Stone , is the presiding Associate 
Judge  of the 233rd District Court  of Tarrant County, Texas. Her office is located at 
200 E. Weatherford St. 5th Floor Fort Worth, TX 76196- 0227.  
Respondent’s Challenged Actions and inaction: The trial court refused to hear 
an emergency motion before it on March 28, 2025, and used out -of-court 
statements made by the opposing counsel regarding a forward looking 
consolidation motion that would be filed at a later date, and denied to hear the 
motion after a full hearing date was agreed upon by both parties for April 10, 2025.  M.2031 M.2031

 Issues Presented  
 
B. Are the  March 14, 2024, temporary orders rendered by an Associate 
Judge  void ab initio b ecause they explicitly state that all parties agree to 
the terms of the order yet only contain the signatures of the opposing 
party and were never properly adopted by the referring court?  
 
C. Did the  Respondent abuse her discretion by failing to perform a clear 
ministerial duty when she refused to consider and rule on Relator's properly filed ex parte emergency Application for TRO ? 
 
D. Did the Respondent further abuse her discretion un- setting the matter for 
a hearing, and favoring a forward- looking consolidation motion as the 
grounds for denying to hear the emergency TRO before a transfer was filed?  
 
E. The Relator has been left without an adequate remedy for an appeal 
because no order resulted from the Respondent judge’s refusal to act on 
Relator’s emergency TRO.  
 
F. Did the Respondent clearly abuse her discretion by excluding any exhibits related to the emergency TRO?

 ARGUMENT  
A. Mandamus Standard 
Mandamus relief is not merely appropriate but imperative  in this case 
because the trial court's inaction and the continued enforcement of a void order 
constitute a clear abuse of discretion for which Relator has no adequate remedy at 
law. The Texas Supreme Court has consistently and unequivocally held that to obtain mandamus relief, a Relator must show (1) the trial court clearly abused its 
discretion or violated a duty imposed by law, and (2) there is no adequate remedy by appeal. In re Bass, 113 S.W.3d 735, 738 (Tex. 2003) (orig. proceeding); Walker 
v. Packer , 827 S.W.2d 833, 839 (Tex. 1992).  
Texas jurisprudence firmly establishes that mandamus will lie to correct a 
void order, even without a traditional showing of inadequate appellate remedy. As 
the Supreme Court of Texas definitively stated in Urbish v.  127th Judicial Dist. 
Court , 708 S.W.2d 429, 431 (Tex. 1986) (orig. proceeding), mandamus will issue 
to correct a void order, i.e., an order the trial court had no power or jurisdiction to render. The Court has further emphasized in In re Sw. Bell Tel. Co. , 35 S.W.3d 602, 
605 (Tex. 2000) (orig. proceeding) that if an order is void, the Relator need not 
show he lacks an adequate appellate remedy, and mandamus relief is appropriate. 
This principle was recently reaffirmed in In re J.R. , No. 02 -21-00060- CV , 2021 
WL 1421440 (Tex. App. —Fort Worth Apr. 15, 2021, orig. proceeding), where the M.2038 M.2038
M.2038 M.2038 M.2038 M.2038

14 
 court explicitly stated: "A trial court abuses its discretion if it enters a void order, 
and mandamus will issue to remedy the void order regardless of whether the relator 
has an adequate remedy by appeal."  
B. The temporary orders rendered on March 14, 2024, are void ab initio  
A fundamental and inviolable principle in Texas jurisprudence is that a 
judgment based on a settlement requires the consent of both parties at the time it is 
rendered by the court. The Texas Supreme Court's seminal decision in Burnaman v. Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 (1951) established the bedrock principle that a party 
is free to withdraw their consent to a settlement at any time before the judgment is rendered. The Court's language was unambiguous and leaves no room for 
interpretation: "A valid consent judgment cannot be rendered by a court when 
consent of one of the parties thereto is wanting. It is not sufficient that a party's 
consent may at one time have been given; consent must exist at the very moment 
the court undertakes to make the agreement the judgment of the court." Id.  This 
principle has been consistently reaffirmed, as in Carter v. Carter, 535 S.W.2d 215 
(Tex. Civ. App. 1976), which emphasized that "the law seems to be clear that a consent judgment cannot be rendered by a trial court when consent of one of the parties is lacking, even though that consent may have been previously given."  
In the present case, the only orders rendered by any court were rendered as 
consent judgments but lack the signatures of all parties. The orders themselves M.2039 M.2039
M.2039 M.2039 M.2039 M.2039

15 
 explicitly state "As evidenced by the signatures below, all parties agree to the terms 
of this order" on page 1, APP 2.1 , and later page 38 states  "APPROVED AND 
CONSENTED TO AS TO BOTH FORM AND SUBSTANCE " yet crucially lacks 
the signature of the Relator and his prior counsel . APP 2.38 . The Court must 
recognize that the absence of the Relator’s  signature is not a mere technical 
deficiency but a fatal jurisdictional flaw that renders the orders void ab initio. Because his signature was required to effectuate consent, and the orders themselves 
acknowledge this requirement, the orders are unquestionably void.  
C. Outright refusing to hear the emergency TRO is a clear abuse of discretion  
It is well- settled and beyond legitimate dispute that a trial court has a 
ministerial duty to consider and rule on motions that have been properly filed and 
brought to the court's attention. The Texas Court of Appeals has emphatically 
stated, "When a motio n is properly filed and pending before the trial court, the act 
of giving consideration to and ruling upon that motion is a ministerial act, and 
mandamus may issue to compel the trial judge to act." Safety -Kleen Corp. v. 
Garcia , 945 S.W.2d 268, 269 (Tex. A pp.- San Antonio 1997, orig. proceeding). To 
establish an abuse of discretion for refusal to rule, the relator must show: (1) the trial court had a legal duty to perform a nondiscretionary act, (2) the relator 
requested performance of that act, and (3) the  trial court failed or refused to do so. M.2040 M.2040
M.2040 M.2040 M.2040 M.2040

16 
 In re Shredder Co., L.L.C. , 225 S.W.3d 676, 679 (Tex. App. —El Paso 2006, orig. 
proceeding).  
Here, the Relator  properly filed his emergency TRO application in the 233rd 
District Court, meticulously followed all procedural requirements, and appeared at 
the scheduled time to present at 9:00 A.M. on March 28 , 2025.  SUPP  2.11 The 
Court must recognize that the court's refusal to even consider the application—
based solely on an opposing counsel's unverified, informal representation about a 
future filing in another court —constitutes a clear and inexcusable failure to 
perform a mi nisterial duty – especially when no response or opposition to the TRO 
was filed by the opposing party and that same party was permitted to interfere with 
the proceedings without being present in the courtroom.  SUPP 2.19 
The refusal is particularly troubling because 1) The TRO application 
involved un- opposed allegations  of immediate harm to children, which courts are 
obligated to address promptly; 2) the refusal was due to a forward looking 
consolidation motion; 3) even if a motion to consolidate had been filed, it would 
not automatically divest the 233rd Court of jurisdiction until actually granted; and 
4) the proper procedure would have been  a motion to transfer, not consolidation.  
See Tex. Fam. Code § 6.407. This misapplication of the law resulted in the refusal 
to hear a properly filed motion to favor a procedurally improper motion that hadn’t even been filed yet.  M.2041 M.2041

17 
 In In re Blakeney , 254 S.W.3d 659, 661 (Tex. App. —Texarkana 2008, orig. 
proc.), the court held that mandamus is appropriate when a trial court refuses to 
rule on a properly filed motion and the relator has no adequate remedy by appeal. 
That is precisely the situation here.  The 233rd Court's refusal to even consider 
Relator's emergency TRO application has left him with no forum to address his urgent concerns about the children's welfare, as the case before the 322nd has been procedurally abandoned and Relator has been seeking relief from facially void 
temporary orders to no avail since March 14, 2024, without any opposition from 
the opposing counsel.  SUPP 3.2  
D. Improper consolidation does not justify the refusal to act  
The 233rd Court’s refusal to act was based on a fundamentally flawed legal 
premise: that the 322nd District Court had continuing exclusive jurisdiction over 
the children. Under Texas Family Code § 155.001, a court acquires continuing exclusive jurisdiction over children only when it renders a “final order” in a SAPCR. It is undisputed that the 322nd Court never rendered any final order 
regarding the children.  Without a final order, the 322nd Court never acquired 
continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the children. Therefore, the 233rd Court 
was entirely within its authority to hear and rule on Relator’s emergency TRO 
application pursuant to § 155.001.  M.2042 M.2042
M.2042 M.2042 M.2042 M.2042

18 
 Moreover, even if the 322nd Court had continuing exclusive jurisdiction 
(which it does not), the proper procedure would have been a motion to transfer 
under the Family Code, not consolidation. Consolidation is appropriate for related 
cases within the same court, not for transferring jurisdiction between courts. By 
refusing to act based on an anticipated consolidation motion, the 233rd Court 
fundamentally misapplied the law, as consolidation cannot be effectuated prior to the transfer of the action. Tex. Fam. Code § 6.407.  
Rather, opposing counsel could have filed a plea in abatement but instead 
chose to Respond to the SAPCR after not prosecuting the divorce case since April 24, 2024.  
E. Relator has been left with no adequate remedy by an appeal  
 Because the 233rd District Court outright refused to hear the emergency 
TRO before it and the appearance before the court produced no order, the Relator has been left without an adequate remedy for an appeal. The Texas Supreme Court has recognized that man damus relief is appropriate when "a party's ability to 
present a viable claim or defense is vitiated or severely compromised." In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. , 148 S.W.3d 124, 136 (Tex. 2004). That is precisely the 
situation here. The Relator has diligently sought relief in a one- sided case to no 
avail, and the 233rd SAPCR was opened to escape the abandoned divorce suit that hasn't been prosecuted since April 24th, 2024,  and has no valid orders in effect.  M.2043 M.2043
M.2043 M.2043 M.2043 M.2043

19 
 F. Refusal to accept relevant exhibits central to the emergency TRO  
 On April 9th, 2025, Relator attempted to file a NOTICE OF INCLUSION 
with the trial court, which included critical exhibits related to the emergency TRO. 
The Judge  refused outright to permit Relator to include any exhibits related to the 
TRO in the rejection comments. SUPP 2.13, 2.16 When contacting the clerk's 
office, no substantive response was received from the court coordinator. The returned comment stated: "Judge’s request. Please resubmit without the attached 
exhibits" without citing any legal authority, statute, rule, or local procedure 
justifying this rejection.  SUPP  1.1. 
This rejection by the clerk constitutes a clear violation of the Texas Rules of 
Civil Procedure. Rule 21(f)(11) states: "The clerk may not refuse to file a document that fails to conform with this rule." Instead, the rule provides that the 
clerk "may ident ify the error to be corrected and state a deadline for the party to 
resubmit the document in a conforming format." Here, the clerk provided no 
specific error to be corrected, and no legal basis for the rejection outside of “we are 
unable to accept any exhibits into the case”. SUPP  1.1 By doing so, the Relator has 
been deprived of essential privileges to make a record pursuant to Tex. Const Art. 1, § 19.  
Moreover, Rule 59 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure states: “Notes, 
accounts, bonds, mortgages, records, and all other written instruments, M.2044 M.2044
M.2044 M.2044 M.2044 M.2044

20 
 constituting, in whole or in part, the claim sued on, or the matter set up in defense, 
may be made a part of the pleadings by copies thereof, or the originals, being 
attached or filed and referred to as such, or by copying the same in the body of the 
plead ing in aid and explanation of the allegations in the petition or answer made in 
reference to said instruments and shall be deemed a part thereof for all purposes.” The request to remove the exhibits specifically for the emergency TRO without 
any statutory backing raises suspicion that the trial court is actively trying to 
prevent the record from being properly established.  
Finally, by rejecting exhibits central to Relator's emergency TRO application 
without legal justification, the clerk has effectively denied Relator the ability to 
make a complete record and present all relevant evidence to this court, thereby 
impairing Relator's due process rights. The rejected exhibits have been served on 
the opposing party and will be included in the supplemental record pursuant to Tex. 
R. App. P. § 52.7(b).   
CONCLUSION AND PRAYER  
 Relator has  been seeking relief for his children for over a year while the  
opposing party has failed to prosecute their case. They obtained orders by falsely claiming consent and  then abandoned their case. There have  been no filed 
responses to any relief sought by the Relator, no objections filed, and if the Relator 
had not opened the SAPCR to seek relief for his Children, there was no indication M.2045 M.2045
M.2045 M.2045 M.2045 M.2045

21 
 that the real party in interest ever intended to move the  dormant divorce proceeding 
towards final trial. There are no valid, legally binding orders in effect, yet  they 
have been used to control the Relator’s livelihood and have destroyed the 
children’s status quo. The opposing counsel only resurfaced at the 11th hour in a 
separate proceeding for the sole purpose of interfering with the relief sought by the Relator  without even being present in the courtroom. SUPP 2.19  
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Relator Charles Dustin Myers 
respectfully prays that this Court:  
1. Issue a writ of mandamus directing Respondent, the Honorable Kate Stone , 
Associate Judge of the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County, Texas, to hear 
and rule on Relator's Emergency Application for Temporary Restraining 
Order at the earliest practical date ; 
2. Grant the emergency temporary relief requested in Relator's separate 
Emergency Motion under TRAP 52.10, filed concurrently with this petition 
because the orders are facially void; 
3. Take judicial notice  that Relator has been unlawfully barred from his 
matrimonial residence and children under these void orders for over a year 
while the real party in interest has remained completely silent; M.2046 M.2046
M.2046 M.2046 M.2046 M.2046

22 
 4. Take judicial notice that no filed responses, objections, or any substantive 
information has been provided by the opposing party throughout these 
proceedings;  
5. Take judicial notice that crucial elements of the claims were prohibited from 
being made a part of the official court record and will be supplemented.  
6. Grant such other and further relief, both general and special, at law and in 
equity, to which Relator may be justly entitled.

1 NO. 233-765358-25 
IN THE 233RD DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY , TEXAS  
TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT:  
I. INTRODUCTION
Ther e comes a time in the journey of life when a man finds himself standing 
in the  same muddy footprints he left as a child, gazing up at the same towering 
courthouse steps, and feeling that same sinking sensation in his chest. It’s a peculiar 
thing, this cycle of disappointment —to have lived it once as a bewildered child and 
then again as a rule- abiding adult. The faces change, the dates on the calendar 
advance, but the feeling remains as familiar as an old, worn book. 
Petitioner comes before this Court not with anger burning in his chest, nor 
with vindictiveness poisoning his pen, but rather with that quiet, heavy disappointment that settles in a person’s bones when they’ve done everything by IN RE: M.E.M., ET AL.

 the book only to find the book itself has been shelved away, forgotten by those 
sworn to read from it.  
Petitioner followed the rules. He honored the procedures. He placed his faith 
in a system that promised justice would flow like water, clear and unobstructed, to those who seek it properly. He lived under the façade of facially void orders, and sustained extraordinary damages that were all caused intentionally by one person: the Respondent , who has sat in complete silence as this breakdown has continued 
to occur. 
Yet here stands Petitioner, a father twice removed —once from his home 
and once from his children—knocking on the courthouse door with papers properly filed, only to be told that the door shall remain closed because someone else might, at some future date, file papers at another door entirely. If this strikes the Court as a curious interpretation of justice, then we find ourselves in rare agreement.  
Mark Twain once observed that “the difference between the almost right word and the right word is really a large matter —it’s the difference between the lightning bug 
and the lightning.” In matters of law and children’s welfare, the difference between almos t justice and actual justice is equally vast—it’s the difference between 
children thriving and children suffering, between a father’s presence and his absence, between following the law and merely gesturing toward it.  
The Petitioner is now in an extraordinary circumstance. On one hand, he 
must seek mandamus relief respectfully compelling this Court to fulfill its  M.2067 M.2067
M.2067 M.2067 M.2067 M.2067

3 
 ministerial duty to hear and rule on Petitioner’s properly file d emergency TRO , 
which this Court refused to hear on March 28, 2025. The refusal came not from any 
defect in the filing itself, but solely from representations made by opposing counsel 
regarding a future filing in another  court which she abandoned—a procedural 
sleight of hand that has left children in distress and a father without an adequate 
remedy for an appeal.  
On the other hand, the Petitioner must prohibit the 322nd District Court from 
setting a matter for a hearing that cannot bear a valid result through a concurrent Writ of Prohibition. The proper procedure wasn’t followed, and cannot be overlooked in the face of an emergency.  
 In essence, a procedurally improper forward- looking consolidation motion 
to be filed in a different court was used to block a properly filed emergency TRO before this court. The court cannot rule on a case not before it, and mandamus is the proper remedy here if this court refuses to act. Given the extraordinary circumstances of this matter, and given there has been no response or opposition to the relief being requested, the court should grant the emergency TRO immediately through a written order delivered to all the parties via the electronic filing manager, set the matter for a hearing 14 days from the signing of 
the order, and require a written response from the opposing party no later than 7 
days prior to the hearing. M.2068 M.2068

  Despite the circumstances of this case, Petitioner feels that settlement will 
and could be a possibility in the future, but the priority remains to rebuild the status 
quo of the children that has been destroyed and regain the ability to provide for his children financially while damages are assessed and attended to. Petitioner is at the  very least entitled to this immediate relief .  He is not asking this court for anything 
more than what it has the discretion to do and what the law demands  that it must do  
given the circumstances . This intent to file mandamus is filed out of respect and 
serves as a notice to all parties of record of my position on this matter. 
Such absurdity should end with an order from this court in Petitioner’s 
favor, and in support thereof, he shows the following unopposed facts: 
II. STATEMENT OF FACTS  
1. On January 24, 2025, after more than 11 months of inaction, Petitioner  
filed a Motion to  Dismiss for Want of Prosecution. The divorce case no 
substantive action from Respondent  since April 2024, a legal ghost ship drifting 
without direction or purpose. That motion wasn’t attempted to be set for hearing until September of 2024, only after the Petitioner exhausted all efforts seeking relief throughout the Texas Judiciary without any participation from the opposing side. 
2. On March 19, 2025, driven by mounting concerns about the children’s 
welfare and learning that the 322
nd District Court did not have continuous, 
exclusive jurisdiction over the children in this matter , Petitioner  filed a new M.2069 M.2069
M.2069 M.2069 M.2069 M.2069

5 
 SAPCR in this Court (Cause No. 233-765358- 25) seeking emergency  relief for 
the children. The very next day, March 20, 2025, Ms. Carter suddenly reappeared 
like a character presumed missing  in the second act, filing an answer to the 
SAPCR petition in this Court and thereby submitting to this Court’s jurisdiction by filing a response rather than a motion to abate. 
3. On March 21, 2025, Petitioner  filed a verified Rule 12 motion 
challenging Ms. Carter’s authority to represent Respondent in this matter—the second such challenge,  met with the same resounding silence as the first.  
4. On March 25, 2025, Petitioner  filed an Objection to Consolidation and 
an Ex -Parte Emergency Motion for TRO. Two days later, on March 27, 2025, 
Petitioner contacted the court coordinator, requested a date and time to present the motion, and served the documents to the opposing party with the intent to present on March 28, 2025, at 9:00 A.M. before the Associate Judge of this Court. On that fateful morning of March 28, 2025, Petitioner  drove to the courthouse, paid for 
parking, met with the coordinator, communicated with opposing counsel, and secured a hearing date of April 10, 2025. Petitioner  then proceeded to the 
Associate Judge’s courtroom to present the TRO. 
5. Before Petitioner  could present his case—before he could speak a single 
word about his children’s welfare—he was told that Ms. Carter would be filing a motion to  consolidate in the 322nd District Court, that his motion was improperly 
before  the court, and that the Associate Judge refused to hear the motion. It was a M.2070 M.2070
M.2070 M.2070 M.2070 M.2070

6 
 curious thing, this refusal. Ms. Carter wasn’t even present in the courtroom, yet 
her words carried more weight than Petitioner’s physical presence,  his properly 
filed papers, and most importantly, the urgent needs of his children. She stopped the proceedings with nothing more than word of mouth for the incorrect motion. A true showcasing of disregard for the process, and the children. 
6. On April 2, 2025, Petitioner  filed a Pre -Objection to Motion to 
Consolidate in the 322
nd District Court. Ms. Carter’s motion to consolidate wasn’t 
filed with the 322nd District Court until April 3, 2025 —six days after she used its 
mere possibility to  prevent this Court from hearing Petitioner’s  emergency 
motion. Her motion disregarded  Petitioner’s  pre-objection entirely, as if it were 
invisible ink on the page. 
7. On April 4, 2025, unable to acquire a ruling due to Petitioner’s 
objection, Ms. Carter attempted to set the motion for a hearing before the 322nd District Court. That same day, Petitioner  filed a Pre-Objection to Motion to 
Transfer in this Court, given that  a motion to transfer must come before any 
attempt at consolidation.  Ms. Carter, who had been so urgently concerned about 
consolidation when it served to block Petitioner’s  emergency hearing, suddenly 
claimed to be unavailable until late April—causing significant delays that could have been avoided had this Court simply heard the motion before it on March 28, 2025. M.2071 M.2071
M.2071 M.2071 M.2071 M.2071

 8. Throughout this period of procedural maneuvering, the children have 
been  subjected to psychological manipulation and medical neglect. They have 
been  removed from Petitioner’s  care and placed with elderly great -grandparents 
on a daily basis, and are being gaslighted into a false belief that the  divorce is 
finalized. Petitioner’s  eldest child’s academic performance has plummeted,  and 
both children have become emotionally estranged from both parents. Petitioner  
has suffered approximately $110,500 in verifiable financial damages due to being 
locked out of his home and business, and it grows each day. But the financial toll 
pales in comparison to the emotional cost of watching Petitioner’s  children  suffer 
while the courts exchange procedurally incorrect  volleys over his head.  
III. ARGUMENT  
A. The Court's Ministerial Duty  
9. It is well- established Texas law that a trial court has a ministerial 
duty—not a discretionary duty—to consider and rule upon motions properly filed and pending before it. In re Sheppard, 193 S.W.3d 181, 183 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2006, orig. proceeding); In re Chavez, 62 S.W.3d 225, 228 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2001, orig. proceeding). The Texas Supreme Court has consistently held that while a court has discretion in how it rules on a motion, it has no discretion to refuse to rule at all. In re Blakeney, 254 S.W.3d 659, 661 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2008, orig. proceeding) ("When a motion is properly filed and pending before a trial court, the act of considering and ruling upon that M.2072 M.2072
M.2072 M.2072 M.2072 M.2072

8 
 motion is a ministerial act, and mandamus may issue to compel the trial judge to 
act.").  
10. This principle is not merely a procedural nicety but a fundamental 
cornerstone of our judicial system. When a court refuses to hear a properly filed motion, it effectively denies access to justice itself. As the Texas courts have repeatedly emphasized,  "A trial court's refusal to rule on a pending motion within 
a reasonable amount of time constitutes a clear abuse of discretion." In re Bonds, 57 S.W.3d 456, 457 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2001, orig. proceeding). This abuse is magnified exponentially when the motion concerns the welfare of children and seeks emergency relief.  
11. The Court's refusal to hear Petitioner's properly filed emergency TRO 
on March 28, 2025, constitutes a clear failure to perform a ministerial duty. This failure is particularly concerning  given that: 
a) The motion was properly filed and noticed for hearing and the parties agreed on a date and time set for April 10
th, 2025; 
b) Petitioner communicated with court staff, physically appeared at the courthouse ready to present the motion and was told he could present his motion ; 
    c) The motion concerned the immediate welfare of children; and  
    d) The refusal was based solely on representations about a future filing in another court that had not yet occurred. M.2073 M.2073
M.2073 M.2073 M.2073 M.2073

9 
 B. Clear Abuse of Discretion  
12. A writ of mandamus is appropriate when a trial court clearly abuses its 
discretion  and there is no adequate remedy by appeal . In re Prudential Ins. Co. of 
Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 135-36 (Tex. 2004); Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 
840 (Tex. 1992) . An abuse if discretion is clearly established from point one 
below, and supported by points two through eight: 
i. First, it refused to perform its ministerial duty to hear and 
rule on a properly filed motion based solely on representations 
about a future filing in another court. It’s as if a doctor refused to 
treat a bleeding patient because another doctor  might, at some 
future date, claim the patient should be treated at a different  
hospital. 
ii. Second, it failed to recognize that by answering the 
SAPCR petition in  this Court, Respondent submitted to this 
Court’s jurisdiction and should have instead filed a motion to abate 
or should have moved to transfer the case. The law doesn’t allow 
for half-measures of jurisdiction. 
iii. Third, it failed to recognize that this Court maintained 
jurisdiction until any  transfer was completed pursuant to Texas 
Family Code § 155.005(d) as no final order has been rendered in 
the 322nd District Court. Jurisdiction  isn’t a hot potato to be M.2074 M.2074
M.2074 M.2074 M.2074 M.2074

10 
 dropped at the first mention of another court—it’s a  solemn 
responsibility that remains until properly transferred.  
iv. Fourth, it failed to recognize that the proper procedure 
for consolidation of cases in different courts requires a motion to 
transfer to be filed and granted before any motion to consolidate 
can be considered, pursuant to Texas Family Code §§ 155.201 and 
6.407. The law provides a sequence, a proper order of operations, 
that cannot be reversed or circumvented without creating 
procedural delay, which is what the emergency TRO sought to 
prevent from occurring. 
v. Fifth, it allowed opposing counsel to circumvent proper 
legal procedure by  influencing this Court’s decision without being 
present and without having filed any response to the emergency 
TRO  properly before this Court. It’s as if the referee in a football 
game made a call  based on what someone in the parking lot said 
might happen in the fourth quarter  when she had the rules of the 
game mixed up. 
vi. Sixth, it failed to consider that the purported “agreed” 
orders in the divorce case are void for lack of consent under 
Burnaman v. Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 (Tex. 1951). A void 
order is no order at all—it’s a legal nullity, as insubstantial as a M.2075 M.2075
M.2075 M.2075 M.2075 M.2075

11 
 shadow on the wall. No court has continuous, exclusive 
jurisdiction over the children in this matter.  
vii. Seventh, it failed to recognize that the Associate 
Judge’s orders in the divorce case were never properly adopted by 
the referring District Court as required  by Texas Family Code § 
201.013(b). An unadopted order is like an unsigned check —it may 
look official, but it carries no legal weight, yet it has been used to 
bar the Petitioner from his residence, business, and children, and 
impose a disruptive and chaotic schedule upon the children. 
viii. Eighth, and perhaps most troublingly, it disregarded 
the children’s best interests  in favor of procedural considerations, 
contrary to Texas Family Code § 153.002 and has languished for 
over a year due to the opposition’s failure to prosecute. 
 
12. The law is clear that in matters involving children, their welfare must 
be the court’s primary consideration—not procedural niceties, not docket management,  and certainly not the convenience of opposing counsel. 
C. No Adequate Remedy by Appeal  
13. When Justice Delayed Is Justice Denied  Petitioner has no adequate 
remedy by appeal for reasons that should stir the conscience of any court:  The 
emergency nature of the injunctive relief sought requires immediate action, as M.2076 M.2076
M.2076 M.2076 M.2076 M.2076

12 
 Petitioner’s children are suffering immediate and ongoing harm while procedural 
issues remain unresolved . In re Texas Dep’t of Family & Protective Servs. , 255 
S.W.3d 613, 615 (Tex. 2008) (granting emergency relief where children’s welfare was at immediate risk).  Petitioner’s children are being alienated from him,  
causing long-term psychological damage that cannot be undone by a favorable ruling months or years in the future. In re Scheller , 325 S.W.3d 640, 643 (Tex. 
2010) (recognizing that interference with the parent -child relationship can 
constitute irreparable harm).  
14. The improper procedural maneuvers by opposing counsel are causing 
significant delays that cannot be remedied through the normal appellate process. Each  day that passes is another day the children suffer, another day their academic  
performance declines, another day they become more emotionally estranged  in a 
situation that the law should’ve prevented from existing to begin with. 
15. Temporary orders in family law cases are generally not appealable, 
leaving  Petitioner in a procedural trap with no exit. Waiting for a final judgment 
to appeal would allow the improper procedural tactics to succeed, causing irreparable harm to Petitioner and his children. 
16. Void orders are being enforced against Petitioner, causing ongoing 
harm that  cannot be adequately remedied by appeal. In re Sw. Bell Tel. Co., 35 
S.W.3d 602, 605 (Tex. 2000). Petitioner is caught in a procedural echo 
chamber M.2077 M.2077
M.2077 M.2077 M.2077 M.2077

13 
 with no effective remedy, as both courts have effectively denied him access to the 
judicial system. In re Team Rocket,  L.P. , 256 S.W.3d 257, 262 (Tex. 2008).  
D. Opposing Counsel’s Contradictory Behavior  
17. Cooper L. Carter’s contradictory behavior warrants particular 
attention, like a  character in a novel whose actions never quite align with their 
words: She zealously defended her client by filing an answer to the SAPCR in this Court, thereby submitting to this Court’s jurisdiction, only to then influence this Court to refuse to hear Petitioner’s  properly filed motion by representing that she 
would file a motion to consolidate in the 322nd Court, which would be moot by statute.  
18. She had abandoned the divorce case for nearly a year, filing nothing 
since April  24, 2024, only to suddenly reappear precisely when I sought 
emergency relief for  the children —like a firefighter who ignores a smoldering 
house for months, only to rush in when someone else calls for help. She failed to respond to a Rule 12 motion challenging her authority to represent the Respondent, her silence speaking volumes about the nature of her representation.  She subsequently filed an improper motion to consolidate in the 
322nd Court without first filing the required motion to transfer, putting the procedural cart  before the horse.  She is now claiming unavailability until late 
April in the 322nd Court, creating unnecessary delay after using the urgency of consolidation to block Petitioner’s  emergency  hearing. M.2078 M.2078
M.2078 M.2078 M.2078 M.2078

14 
 19. This pattern demonstrates a tactical attempt to manipulate both courts’ 
dockets to prevent me from obtaining a timely hearing on Petitioner’s  properly 
filed emergency  motion. It’s a shell game played with the children’s welfare as 
the prize.  This Court should not allow itself to be used as an instrument in such 
procedural gamesmanship, particularly when it involves a failure to perform a 
ministerial duty required by law and when children’s welfare is at stake. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
 
This Court’s refusal to hear Petitioner’s properly filed motion constitutes a 
failure to perform a ministerial duty for which there is no adequate remedy by appeal. The proper legal procedure requires a motion to transfer to be filed and granted before any motion to consolidate can be considered, and by answering the SAPCR petition in this Court, Respondent submitted to this Court’s jurisdiction. 
The children who are the subject of this proceeding are suffering 
immediate and  ongoing harm while procedural issues remain unresolved. Each 
day that passes  without addressing the emergency concerns raised in Petitioner’s 
TRO is a day  of certain  damage to the children’s psychological well- being and 
development. 
Petitioner once heard it said that the true measure of a society is found in 
how it treats its most vulnerable members. By that measure, the procedural labyrinth that has prevented this Court from hearing Petitioner’s emergency M.2079 M.2079
M.2079 M.2079 M.2079 M.2079

15 
 motion speaks volumes about how far we have strayed from the ideal of justice. 
The children — innocent, vulnerable, and deserving of the Court’s protection—
have instead  become collateral damage in a game of procedural chess.  
Petitioner provides this petition not out of anger or vindictiveness, but out 
of that quiet, heavy disappointment that settles in a person’s bones when they’ve done everything by the book only to find the book itself has been shelved away.  
Petitioner followed the rules. He reiterates that h e honored the procedures. H e 
placed his faith in  a system that promised justice would flow like water, clear a nd 
unobstructed, to those who seek it properly. 
Petitioner asks this Court to remember that behind every case number, 
behind every filing, behind every procedural rule, there are often  real children 
with real lives  that continue whether the courts act or not. Time doesn’t stop for 
them while  adults sort out procedural disagreements. They grow, they hurt, they 
form  memories and impressions that will shape them for a lifetime.  
As Mark Twain might have observed, the difference between justice 
served and  justice delayed is the difference between a father’s presence and his 
absence,  between children thriving and children suffering, between following the 
law and  merely gesturing toward it.  
V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF  
 
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED , Petitioner respectfully 
requests that this Court correct its error sua sponte, recognize the seriousness of M.2080 M.2080
M.2080 M.2080 M.2080 M.2080

16 
 this situation, and grant relief without delay given the extraordinary circumstances 
of this case. Petitioner specifically  requests that this Court: 
i. Immediately grant the  attached proposed order requesting an 
emergency TRO preventing the Respondent from barring Petitioner’s access to the matrimonial home located at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148 pursuant to Texas Family Code § 105.001(b) and serve the order on all parties of record through the EFM pursuant to rule 21a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure ;  
ii. Have the parties confer with the court coordinator to set this matter for a hearing within 14 days from the signing of the order, and require Respondent’s written response no later than 7 days before the hearing;  
iii. Take judicial notice that  this Court has personal jurisdiction over 
the respondent to issue a TRO  given her response to the original 
SAPCR;   
iv. Take judicial notice  that no opposition to the requested  relief 
appears on record;  
v. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and necessary to protect the best interests of the children, under § 153.002 and aid the parties in satisfy ing Texas State policy under § 
153.001. M.2081 M.2081
M.2081 M.2081 M.2081 M.2081

17 
  Petitioner emphasizes that this request is urgent and narrowly 
tailored to avoid further procedural delay that places the children at risk.

IN THE 233RD DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY , TEXAS  
 
 
TO THE HONORABLE COURT:  
 Petitioner, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, PRE -OBJECTS to any motion to transfer filed  
on behalf of COOPER L. CARTER in this matter, and in support thereof, shows the following: 
I. INTRODUCTION 
1. On March 28, 2025, Petitioner  set a properly filed motion to be heard in front of the 
associate Judge. 
2. Petitioner was denied an opportunity to be heard due to the claim that COOPER L.  
CARTER would be filing a motion to consolidate in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County  
as justification for the denial of due process. 
 3. On April 2nd, 2025, Petitioner filed a PRE- OBJECTION laying out the legal reasons  
why COOPER L. CARTER ’s consolidation motion was improper, and premature. 
 4. COOPER L. CARTER cannot move to consolidate this matter with the divorce suit  
pending before the 322nd District Court because the Texas Family Co de 6.407(b) explicitly  
states:  
“On the transfer of the proceedings, the court with jurisdiction of the suit for dissolution of a 
marriage shall consolidate the two causes of action. ”

5. The refore, COOPER L. CARTER ’s motion to consolidate is procedurally improper, and was  
used as a tool to interfere with emergency proceedings where  no answer was provided. 
 6. The court cannot refuse to hear a properly filed motion before it and give deference to an  
improperly filed motion notwithstanding COOPER L. CARTER’ s misconduct and failure to prosecute the  
divorce suit.  
II. CONCLUSION 
 7. For the se reasons, Petitioner respectfully OBJECTS to any motion to transfer filed on behalf of

 8. Furthermore, before any motion to transfer is to be set by COOPER L. CARTER, her authority

NO. 322-744263-23 
IN THE 322nd DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY , TEXAS  
TO THE HO NORABLE COURT:  
Under Texas law, the doctrine of dominant jurisdiction dictates that when two suits 
involving the same parties and subject matter are filed in courts of concurrent jurisdiction, the 
court where the suit was first filed typically acquires exclusive control.  However, this 
presumption can be overcome by showing that the first suit was initiated in bad faith or for the purpose of delay. Texas courts, following the rule established in Wyatt v. Shaw Plumbing Co., recognize exceptions where the first suit was filed merely to establish procedural priority, in anticipation of subsequent litigation, or to stall the opposing party’s legitimate claims. These principles provide a vital check against strategic abuse of court processes and ensure jurisdictional fairness when forum manipulation is evident.  
This analysis looks into the cir cumstances surrounding this matter, and is presented in a 
good- faith effort to provide insight to the court. ITMOMO

Dominant Jurisdiction Analysis with Bad Faith Focus  
I. Legal Framework for Dominant Jurisdiction 
A. General Principles  
Under Texas law, the doctrine of dominant jurisdiction provides that when two suits are 
pending in courts of concurrent jurisdiction involving the same parties and subject matter, the 
court in which the suit was first filed acquires dominant jurisdiction to the exclusion of the other court. This doctrine is established in the seminal case of Curtis v. Gibbs , 511 S.W.2d 263 (Tex. 
1974), where the Texas Supreme Court held that any subsequent suit involving the same parties and controversy must be dismissed if a party to that suit calls the second court's attention to the pendency of the prior suit. 
B. Bad Faith Exception 
However, Texas courts recognize an important exception to the dominant jurisdiction 
doctrine: when the first-filed suit was brought in bad faith or for the purpose of delay. As 
established in Wyatt v. Shaw Plumbing Co., 760 S.W.2d 245, 248 (Tex. 1988), the first court's 
dominant jurisdiction can be defeated by showing that the first suit was filed: 
1. As a mere pretext to establish priority; 
2. In anticipation of the second suit; 
3. For the purpose of delay; or 
4. In bad faith. 
When this exception applies, the second court may proceed with its case despite the pendency of the first- filed suit.  M.2090 M.2090
M.2090 M.2090 M.2090 M.2090

II. Evidence of Bad Faith in the Initial Suit
A. Chronology Demonstrating Premeditated Legal Strategy
1.Pre-Filing Coordination with Dan Branthoover (December 14-17, 2023)
•Morgan exchanged 92 text messages with Dan Branthoover on December 14,
2023
•Dan persuaded Charles to allow Morgan to bring children to his residence underfalse pretenses
•While at Dan's residence, Morgan prepared divorce papers with his assistance
•Dan purchased a second phone for Morgan and pepper spray mace
2.Financial Misconduct Prior to Filing (December 15 -16, 2023)
•Morgan transferred $1,576 from joint account to Dan's PayPal account
•When confronted, Dan falsely claimed Morgan transferred money to her ownaccount
•Morgan then claimed to be indigent in her divorce filing despite having justtransferred these funds
3.False Claims in Initial Filings (December 18 -22, 2023)
•Morgan filed for divorce on December 18, 2023, claiming to be indigent
•She falsely claimed an active protection order already existedM.2091 M.2091
M.2091 M.2091 M.2091 M.2091

•She falsely claimed family violence had occurred during the marriage to waive
the 60- day waiting period
•She falsely claimed financial responsibility for bills that Charles paid
•Despite claiming an active protective order already existed, she filed for anotherone on December 22, 2023
B. Misrepresentations to the Court
1.False Allegations of Family Violence
•No evidence of family violence was ever presented
•Morgan claimed family violence occurred on December 18, 2023, which wasdemonstrably false
•These allegations were strategically included to waive the 60 -day waiting period
for divorce
2.False Financial Affidavits
•Morgan claimed indigent status immediately after transferring $1,576 from jointaccount
•She misrepresented financial responsibilities, claiming to make both car payments
•She falsely claimed to have no money despite the recent transfer
3.Fabricated Protective Order Status
•Morgan's grandmother served an eviction notice claiming a protective order hadbeen filed when none existedM.2092 M.2092
M.2092 M.2092 M.2092 M.2092

•Initial divorce filing claimed an active protective order existed when none did
•These misrepresentations were designed to prejudice the court against Charles
C. Procedural Manipulation
1.Strategic Delays and Attorney Changes
•At the January 22, 2024 hearing, Morgan appeared without counsel
•She hired Cooper L. Carter on the spot in the courtroom lobby to cause further
delay
•This tactic successfully delayed the case until February 1, further prejudicingCharles
2.Self-Help Tactics Outside Legal Process
•On March 6, 2024, Morgan illegally locked Charles outside the home
•This occurred after Charles had filed notice with the court that he would not leaveuntil after the hearing
•This demonstrated willingness to circumvent legal process
3.Systematic Non -Prosecution
•After securing favorable temporary orders, Morgan's counsel ceased prosecutingthe case
•Last action in the divorce matter was April 24, 2024, nearly one year agoM.2093 M.2093
M.2093 M.2093 M.2093 M.2093

•This pattern suggests the initial filing was not intended to resolve the dispute but
to secure tactical advantages
III. Application of Bad Faith Exception to Current Case
A. Legal Analysis
The facts of this case align precisely with the bad faith exception outlined in Wyatt v. Shaw 
Plumbing Co. The initial divorce filing shows clear evidence of being: 
1.A mere pretext to establish priority : The coordinated preparation of documents with
Dan Branthoover before any legitimate attempt at reconciliation or mediationdemonstrates the filing was pretextual.
2.Filed in anticipation of potential action by Charles : The timing of the filing after
Charles discovered evidence of an affair suggests anticipatory filing to gain tacticaladvantage.
3.For the purpose of delay : The systematic non -prosecution of the case for nearly a year
after securing favorable temporary orders demonstrates the purpose was not resolutionbut delay.
4.In bad faith : The numerous false statements in court filings, including claims about
protective orders, family violence, and financial status, constitute clear bad faith.
B. Case Law Support
1.In re Henry , 274 S.W.3d 185, 193 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2008, pet. denied)M.2094 M.2094
M.2094 M.2094 M.2094 M.2094

•Court held that "filing a lawsuit for an improper purpose, such as to harass, cause
unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation, is sanctionableconduct."
•The pattern of behavior in the initial divorce filing aligns with this standard.
2.Perry v. Del Rio , 66 S.W.3d 239, 252 (Tex. 2001)
•The Texas Supreme Court recognized that "the first-filed rule should not beapplied inflexibly or when doing so would reward gamesmanship or ill motive."
•Morgan's coordinated preparation of divorce filings while misleading Charlesabout her intentions constitutes precisely the kind of gamesmanship courts shouldnot reward.
3.Gonzalez v. Reliant Energy, Inc. , 159 S.W.3d 615, 622 (Tex. 2005)
•Court held that dominant jurisdiction does not apply when the first suit is filed "inanticipation of the second suit and in an effort to subvert the second action."
•The timing and coordination with Dan Branthoover suggest the divorce was filedin anticipation of potential action by Charles after discovering the affair.
C. Family Law Context
In family law matters, courts have been particularly vigilant about bad faith filings due to their 
impact on children and families: 
1.In re Marriage of Allen , 593 S.W.3d 133, 137 (Tex. 2019)M.2095 M.2095
M.2095 M.2095 M.2095 M.2095

•The Texas Supreme Court emphasized that in family law matters, courts must be
particularly vigilant about procedural gamesmanship that affects children'swelfare.
•The false allegations of family violence and protective orders directly implicatethis concern.
2.In re Sims , 88 S.W.3d 297, 303- 04 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2002, orig. proceeding)
•Court held that in SAPCR cases, the best interest of the child can override strictapplication of dominant jurisdiction.
•The systematic non-prosecution of the case has prevented resolution, contrary tothe children's best interests.
IV . Implications for Current Proceedings
A. Legal Consequences of Bad Faith Finding
If the court determines the initial divorce filing was made in bad faith, several significant legal 
consequences follow: 
1.Dominant Jurisdiction Defeated : The 233rd District Court would not be bound by the
dominant jurisdiction of the 322nd District Court where the divorce was filed.
2.Consolidation Order Invalidated : The consolidation order would be invalid not only for
procedural defects but also because it erroneously applied dominant jurisdictionprinciples to a bad faith filing.
3.Independent Proceeding Permitted : Charles's SAPCR filing in the 233rd District Court
could proceed independently, unaffected by the prior divorce filing.M.2096 M.2096
M.2096 M.2096 M.2096 M.2096

4.Potential for Sanctions : The court could consider sanctions against Morgan and/or her
counsel for the bad faith filing and misrepresentations to the court.
B. Strategic Approach for Rehearing Motion
In the motion for rehearing, the bad faith analysis should be presented as an independent, 
alternative ground for mandamus relief: 
1.Primary Argument : The consolidation order should be vacated due to procedural defects
(lack of notice, hearing, proper transfer).
2.Alternative Argument : Even if procedurally proper, consolidation was improper
because the first -filed suit's dominant jurisdiction was defeated by bad faith.
3.Relief Requested : The court should:
•Vacate the consolidation order
•Recognize the 233rd District Court's authority to proceed independently with theSAPCR
•Order the trial court to hear Charles's emergency TRO on its merits
V . Conclusion
The doctrine of dominant jurisdiction is not an absolute rule but a principle of judicial 
efficiency that yields when its application would reward bad faith or procedural gamesmanship. The extensive evidence of coordination before filing, false statements in court documents, and systematic non -prosecution after securing favorable orders demonstrates that the initial divorce 
filing was made in bad faith. M.2097 M.2097
M.2097 M.2097 M.2097 M.2097

Under Texas law, this bad faith defeats any claim of dominant jurisdiction by the 322nd District 
Court. Consequently, the consolidation order was not only procedurally defective but substantively erroneous in its application of dominant jurisdiction principles. The Court of Appeals should grant rehearing and issue mandamus relief to prevent the trial court from rewarding this bad faith through improper consolidation. M.2098 M.2098

2 I.INTRODUCTION
Relator  intends to  invoke  this Court’s original jurisdiction in three 
closely related mandamus proceedings arising from overlapping  family law 
cases in Tarrant Count y. The three issues central to this dispute involve 
facially void temporary orders, the refusal to hear an emergency TRO, and 
the granting of the opposing party’s consolidation motion sua sponte in the 
face of an objection.  All three matters are legally and procedurally 
interdependent yet hinge on each-other to effectuate resolution. To provide 
context, the three mandamus matters are: 
1. No. 02-25-00164- CV (“TRO Mandamus”)
Issue Prese nted : Whether the  233rd District Court erred in re fusing  to 
adjudicate an emergency request for temporary relief in a SAPCR 
properly filed before it on March 28, 2025. 
Procedural  Posture: Denied per curiam on April 11, 2025; rehearing 
Brief P osture: The  TRO m andamus proceeding  raises core legal i ssues 
concerning  a trial court ’s mini sterial dut y to ru le on  properly filed 
motions , the abuse of discretion i n refusing to hear an emergenc y TRO 
based on a future, unfiled consolidation moti on, and the denial of due 
process by refusing t o rule on the matter before it. 
2. No. 02-25-00166- CV (“Void -Order Mandamus”)
Issue Presented : Whether temporary orders issued by the 322nd District 
Court on March 14, 2024, are void ab initio for want of consent. (MR 
17.1) 
Procedural Posture : Pending decision before this Court. M.2108 M.2108
M.2108 M.2108 M.2108 M.2108

3 Brief Posture: Showcases a total breakdown of procedur e between 
January 16th, 2024’ s “kick-out” order (MR 6.1) and March 14th, 2024’ s 
one-s ided consent j udgement. (MR. 17.38)  
3. Forthcoming Petition – To Be Filed By April 16, 2025 (“Consolidation
Mandamus”)
Issue Presented:  Whether the  sua sponte granting of Real Party’s 
consolidation motion  without addressing the objection, notice, or holding 
a hearing caused further prejudice to the Relator.
Relief Anticipated: A writ of mandamus vacating  the consolidation 
order on grounds that it was entered without notice, without hearing, and 
in the face of Relator’s standing objection to consolidate , and a pending 
rule 12 motion.  
II.BACKGROUND SUMMARY
Between December 14, 2023, and December 22, 2023, Real Party in 
Interest, Morgan Myers, attempted to get an emergency ex-parte  order of 
protection from the court below (MR 2.7), initiated an eviction proceeding 
(MR 19.15), converted $1,576 of joint- marital assets to a family member on 
her way to receive help in preparing divorce paperwork (MR 19.14), initiated a protective order suit, (MR  19.15), and filed for divorce claiming that an 
active order of protection existed against the undersigned. (MR 2.7) 
This frenzy of frivolous lawsuits was designed to acquire an advantage 
in the divorce proceedings, which ultimately succeeded on January 16, 2024. M.2109 M.2109
M.2109 M.2109 M.2109 M.2109

4 (MR 6 .1). Spinning a narrative of the need for protection, Real Party leveraged 
this initial award to her advantage and was able to delay the proceedings 
further on January 22 by acquiring her legal representative three minutes prior 
to the hearing. (MR 7), eventually leading to settlement and a non- suit of her 
allegations (MR 8.3), which became the orders of the court on March 14, 
2024, and were rendered as an agreement without M r. Myers ’ consent. (MR. 
17.38) The r emainder of the litigation amounted to a one -sided effort by the 
undersigned to seek relief while the opposing party sat in silence and 
abandoned their case. ( MR 1) 
After eleven months of silence, the Real Party became active again 
only after the SAPCR was opened by Mr. Myers, who was prevented from 
presenting his emergency TRO at the 11th hour, resulting in no order, and 
the emergency still ongoing.
Shortly after the initial mandamus was filed on April 10, 
2025, the Honorable Kenneth Newell sua sponte consolidated the 
cases without notice by granting Real Party’s motion in the face of 
an objection, and without a hearing to discuss the pertinent issues. 
The undersigned is prepared to litigate these matters, and the necessity 
to stay these proceedings is essential to preserve the rights of the parties and 
prevent f urther i rreparable harm from occurring in the interim. M.2110 M.2110
M.2110 M.2110 M.2110 M.2110

5 III.NECESSITY FOR STAY
Texa s Rule of Appellate Proc edure 52. 10 Authorizes a St ay to 
Preserve t he St atus Quo. Texas R ule of Appellate Procedure 52. 10(b) 
empowe rs this Court to “stay the unde rlying proceedings pe nding mandamus 
review” . A stay i s warranted here t o “preserve i mportant substantive a nd 
procedural ri ghts from i mpairment or loss” which h ere, i s exactly t he 
situation calling for such a remedy.  
The procedural posture of this case combined by the lack of 
participation by the opposing side and lack of input from the courts below 
throughout presents a truly unique situation from a legal perspective.
IV. SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT
The 322nd and 233rd District Courts of Tarrant County , Texas, are 
locked in a jurisdictional impasse that must be resolved to protect the best 
interests of the children and restore procedural integrity. These matters can 
be concurrently resolved through stepwise legal analysis. The first and most 
critical question is whether the current temporary orders—issued as an 
agreed judgement without the consent of all parties—can stand (MR 17.1, 
MR 17.38). M.2111 M.2111
M.2111 M.2111 M.2111 M.2111

6 If those orders are deemed void, then the 322nd District Court cannot 
assert continuing, exclusive jurisdiction (CEJ) under the Texas Family Code, 
which requires a valid final order to attach.  see Tex. Fam. Code § 155.001. In 
that event, the SAPCR filed in the 233rd District Court by the undersigned should stand as a procedurally proper original suit, and mandamus should 
issue to administer a hearing regarding the emergency TRO refused on 
March 28, 2025,  without producing any valid order to challenge . 
At that juncture, should the Real Party argue dominant jurisdiction, the 
court must weigh the well -recognized exceptions under Texas law, including 
bad faith, unjustified delay, and strategic pretext —all of which are clearly 
demonstrated and conclusively established in the mandamus record filed 
concurrently with this matter.  
V. ARGUMENT
A.An agreed judgement rendered without consent is voidThe first point of issue in this matter is the facially void orders rendered
on March 14, 2024. an order cannot expressly claim all parties consent “ as 
evidenced by the signatures below” (MR 17.1) and then be absent from the 
document. (MR 17.38)  M.2112 M.2112
M.2112 M.2112 M.2112 M.2112

7 
 This is clear and cut Texas precedent . “A valid consent judgment cannot 
be rendered by a court when consent of one of the parties thereto is wanting. 
It is not sufficient to support the judgment that a party's consent thereto may 
at one time have been given; consent must exist at the very moment the court 
undertakes to make the agreement the judgment of the court.”  Burnaman v. 
Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 (Tex. 1951)  
Here, the exact opposite occurred but our cas e takes it a step further. 
Mr. Myers was ordered to sign an agreement that he was in court that very 
same day to challenge. (MR 16.1) (“3. It is ordered  that the parties shall 
present the temporary orders regarding the [associate judge’s report] signed on 02/01/2024 by 1:30 p.m. today.”)  
 Moreover, the order e xplicitly refers to the Associate Judge ’s Report 
signed on February 1, 2024, which could not have been possible  because the 
attorney who was ordered to prepare the orders was no longer on the case. (MR 11) Therefore, the orders must be set aside, and mandamus should issue 
here.  
B. Continuous, exclusive jurisdiction  
Once the orders are declared void, we can then turn to the Texas Family 
Code § 155.001(a) , whi ch states  “Specifically, except  as otherwise provided M.2113 M.2113
M.2113 M.2113 M.2113 M.2113

8 by this section, a court acquires continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the 
matters provided for by this title in connection with a child on the rendition of 
a final order. ” Without the March 14 orders in place, which were a nullity from 
the start, the 322nd District Court does not retain continuous, exclusive 
jurisdiction as no other orders exist. Therefore, § 155.001 (d) makes the 
SAPCR suit vali d by statute , which leads us to an analysis o f dominant 
jurisdiction.  
C.Doctrine of D ominant Jurisdiction
 Under Texas law, the doctrine of dominant jurisdiction provides that 
when two suits are pending in courts of concurrent jurisdiction involving the same parties and subject matter, the court in which the suit was first filed 
acquires dominant jurisdiction to the exclusion of the other court. This 
doctrine is established in the seminal case of Curtis v. Gibbs , 511 S.W.2d 263 
(Tex. 1974), where the Texas Supreme Court held that any subsequent suit 
involving the same parties and controversy must be dismissed if a party to that 
suit calls the second court's  attention to the pendency of the prior suit.  
Normally, if the SAPCR matter were to try and set a matter for hearing, 
the Real Party could argue for dominant jurisdiction, as the divorce matter M.2114 M.2114
M.2114 M.2114 M.2114 M.2114

9 was the “first fi led” suit, a nd is pe nding before t he 322nd District Court, an d 
would have the suit transferred or abated. 
D. Bad Faith Exception
However, Texas courts recognize an important exception to the 
dominant jurisdiction doctrine: when the first -filed suit was brought in bad 
faith or for the purpose of dela y. As established in Wyatt v. Shaw Plumbing 
Co., 760 S. W.2d 245, 248 ( Tex. 1988), the first court's dominant jurisdiction 
can be defeated by showing that the first suit was filed:  
1. As a mere pretext to establish priority;
2. In anticipation of the second suit;
3. For the purpose of delay; or
4. In bad faith.
E. Three of four  exceptions to dominant jurisdiction apply here
Here, three out of four of these exceptions apply. The suit was a mere 
pretext to establish priority, as Real Party went out of her way to file multiple 
frivolous lawsuits alleging family violence (MR 2.7, MR 3) only to then drop 
her claims after securing the children and home and abandon the case. (MR 
8.3)  M.2115 M.2115
M.2115 M.2115 M.2115 M.2115

10 The bad faith conducted by Real Party can be discerned by looking at 
the face of her pleadings themselves. On her original petition for divorce, on 
page 7, Real Party makes it known that she attempted to seek an emergency 
ex-parte order of protection on December 14, 2023. (MR 2.7) So the logical 
question to ask would be: why did Real Party need an emergency ex- parte 
order of protection if she already had an active order of protection? Better 
yet, why did mother seek a third protective order on December 22, 2023, if an 
active protective  order was already in place? (MR 3)  More importantly, why 
would she claim an active order of protection existed when she knew that 
wasn’t the case? (MR 2.7 ) This is a clear establishment of bad faith litigation, 
which also precluded her advantage  by labeling the undersigned as an abuser  
prior to adjudication, satisfying two of four exceptions to dominant 
jurisdiction.  
Finally, after acquiring the children and home  at the outset (MR. 6.1) 
and through the series of orders leading up to March 14, 2024 , Real Party 
then abandoned her case and  left the undersigned seeking relief throughout 
the Texas judiciary without opposition or participation . The only item found 
on the docket from the opposing side since then is a motion for pre -trial 
conference on April 24, 2024. (MR 1. 7 DKT 20 6) In fact, it was only when M.2116 M.2116
M.2116 M.2116 M.2116 M.2116

11 the unde rsigned opened the sepa rate SA PCR t hat opposing counsel rus hed in 
to defend it, l eading to the c oncurrent m andamus filed under cause num ber 
No. 02 -25-00164- CV currently at t he rehe aring stage . 
Therefore, be cause t hree of the four exceptions established i n Wyatt 
apply here, t he 322nd District Court of Tarrant c ounty arguably w ould not 
retain dominant j urisdiction over the SA PCR suit fi led by the undersigned to 
escape t his proc edural qua gmire, a nd mandamus could issue t here on 
rehearing so that t hey may lawfully proceed with the em ergency T RO 
hearing which was turned away on March 28, 2025 , which will l ead to a 
situation t hat resembles w hat the le gislature intends r ather th an th e exact 
opposite. See Tex. Fam. Code 153.001. 
VI.Under the procedural posture of this case, a stay is not burdensome or
unduly prejudicial to the Real Party  
Given the unique and intertwined procedural posture of this matter, a 
stay is both appropriate and necessary to preserve the integrity of appellate 
review.  Unlike Relator  and the children—who continues to suffer irreparable 
harm under the force of void orders and were thrown into a chaotic 
arrangement  —the Real Party in Interest faces no comparable prejudice from 
a stay. In fact, the Real Party has taken no meaningful action to prosecute their M.2117 M.2117
M.2117 M.2117 M.2117 M.2117

12 claims  and has allowed the case to stall for nearly  a full calendar year . Any 
suggestion of prejudice is undermined by their own inaction. Relator, by 
contrast, has acted swiftly to correct procedural defects and vindicate his 
rights, and is fully prepared to brief this Honorable court regarding the matters 
at issue. 
VII. PRAYER
To the unde rsigne d’s knowledge, no pro se l itigant ha s ever bee n 
compelled t o file t hree concurrent m andamus petitions addressing three 
separate structural irregularities involving two d istrict courts in  a single -
family law m atter. T his unp recedented procedural post ure is not t he re sult of 
litigation excess, but rather a response t o a ca scading breakdown of 
jurisdiction, due proc ess, and court administration, which independently 
threatens t he ability of this Honorable Court t o grant m eaningful re lief. 
In fact, the only liti gation th at has occurred in this case ha s come from 
the unde rsigned. This litigation is not fue led by vindictiveness n or spite, but 
rather from the necessity to restore th e status quo so that t his divorce may 
proceed. The Re lator holds the upm ost re spect for all t hree Judge s named in 
this suit, a nd it is h is prerogative to a id in the case’ s forward- looking M.2118 M.2118
M.2118 M.2118 M.2118 M.2118

13 resolution, begin ning with the restoration of the status quo. A stay should 
issue.  
WHEREFORE, PREMISES C ONSIDERED , Relator C HARLES 
DUSTIN MYERS respectfully prays that t his H onorable Court : 
1.Grant an immediate emergency stay pursuant to Texas Rule of
Appellate Procedure 52.10(b), staying proceedings in the 322nd  District 
Court of Tarrant County, Texas—i ncluding but not limited to the March 14, 
2024 temporary orders—p ending final disposition of the mandamus 
proceedings; 
2.Grant mandamus relief to preserve the status quo to protect the
best interests of the children, and to prevent further irreparable harm to 
Relator’s constitutional rights, business, and parent-child relationship; 
3.Permit Relator to file his third mandamus petition by April 16, 2025,
if the court deems necessary;
4.Grant such other and further relief, at law or in equity, to which
Relator may be justly entitled. 
Respectfully submitted,  M.2119 M.2119

13 ARGUMENT  
A. Mandamus Standard
Mandamus relief is warranted when the trial court clearly abused its 
discretion,  and the Relator (“Mr. Myers”), h as no adequate appellate remedy. In re 
Coppola, 535 S.W.3d 506, 508 (Tex. 2017) (orig. proceeding) (per curiam). “A 
trial court clearly abuses its discretion if ‘it reaches a decision so arbitrary and 
unreasonable as to amount to a clear and prejudicial error of law' [or if it clearly 
fails] to analyze or apply the law correctly ․” Walker v. Packer,  827 S.W.2d 833, 
839–4 0 (Tex. 2006) (orig. proceeding) (quoting Johnson v . Fourth Court of 
Appeals, 700 S.W.2d 916, 917 (Tex. 1985), disapproved of on other grounds by In 
re Columbia Med. Ctr. of Las Colinas, Subsidiary, L.P., 290 S.W.3d 204 (Tex. 
2009)). In any event, as shown in the next section, appeal is no remedy at all under 
these urgent circumstances. 
B. Consolidation and EX -Part e Procedure
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 174(a) permits consolidation of actions that 
involve common questions of law or fact. (APP 6.1) See also Lone Star Ford, Inc.  v. 
McCormick , 838 S. W.2d 734, 7 37 (Tex. App. -Houston [1st D ist.] 1992, w rit 
denied) . A trial c ourt c annot a rbitrarily consolidate ca ses in a manner that 
prejudices one of the pa rties. E ven whe n consolidation is pe rmissible i n principle, 
the c ourt m ust ba lance j udicial c onvenience against any risk of unfa ir prejudice or M.2137 M.2137

14 confusio n, and it m ust re spect t he pa rties’ right t o be he ard on the i ssue. Crestway 
Care Ct r., Inc. v. B erchelmann , 945 S. W.2d 872, 87 4 (Tex. App. —San Antonio 
1997, or ig. proc eeding) (en banc). Consolidation decisions are re viewe d for abuse 
of discretion, a nd “a trial court m ay abuse i ts discretion by … c onsolidating cases 
when the consolidation results in prejudice t o the complaining part y.” (citing Lone 
Star F ord, 838 S. W.2d at 738)  
In other words, w hen deciding w hether to consolidate, t he trial c ourt m ust 
balance t he judicial economy a nd co nvenience that may be gained by the 
consolidation against t he risk of a n unfair outcome be cause of prejudice . See Dal -
Briar, 833 S. W.2d at 615. Even i f the cases share c ommon questions o f law and 
fact, an abuse of discretion may be found if the c onsolidation results i n 
prejudice t o the complaining part y. Lone Star Ford, Inc ., 838 S. W.2d at 738. 
Here, t hat is precisely what occurre d. Mr. Myers has t hree concurrent 
mandamuses now before this court, and cause number 02-2 5-00164-C V, (“the 
TRO/SAPCR mandamus”) sought emergency relief in March 2025. (MR 8.2) The 
court’s procedural handling of his Application for Temporary Restraining Order 
(TRO) was highly irregular and violated the letter and spirit of Texas procedural 
rules.  
Texa s Rule of Civil Procedure 680 provides that no TRO sha ll be gra nted 
without notice to the adverse p arty u nless specific facts show im mediate M.2138 M.2138
M.2138 M.2138 M.2138 M.2138

15 irreparable injury will occur before notice can be given. Even when an ex parte 
TRO is justified, TRCP 680 requires the order to be narrowly time -limited (14 
days) and promptly set for hearing on a temporary injunction.  (APP 7)  Here, Mr. 
Myers  followed the rules by giving notice to the opposing party and coordinating 
with the Court for a presentation of his TRO.  (MR 12.1-12.9) Tarrant County Local 
Rule 4.01(11)(e) (l ikewise requires a party seeking ex parte  relief to certify to the 
Court the efforts made to notify the opposing side or explain why notice should not 
be given. Mr. Myers never received a response from the opposing side.  
Notably, on March 27, 2025, the Court (through its coordinator) insisted that 
Mr. Myers  appear in person to present the TRO and inform opposing counsel of the 
scheduled time. The coordinator wrote:  
“This order needs to be presented in person. Likewise, you need to inform opposing 
counsel of the date and time you intend to present this order to the court.” (MR 12.9) 
Mr. Myers  promptly complied. He emailed Ms. Allison on March 27 
confirming that he had informed the opposing counsel of the intended presentation 
at 9:00 a.m. the following day and that he would update both the Court and opposing party if anything changed. 
(MR 12.9) 
After receiving no response from either the opposing counsel or real party in 
interest, Mr. Myers served the documents he intended to present to the court.  (MR 
12.19) Rather than corresponding with Mr. Myers directly, the opposing counsel 
contacted the court coordinator, where she stated via email:  M.2139 M.2139
M.2139 M.2139 M.2139 M.2139

16  “I have received communication from opposing party who is pro se that he will be 
walking through an Emergency TRO. Our office has a hearing scheduled for tomorrow morning 
in Parker County and is unable to attend. However, I will be available by cell phone regarding 
this matter if the Judge would like to speak to me regarding the Emergency TRO. Please 
contact our office to patch me in for any calls that Judge would like to have.” (MR 12.20) 
and most critically, the opposing  counsel went on to say: 
“Additionally, this case already is pending in the 322nd for a divorce proceeding 
regarding property and children matters. We will be consolidating the case and walking it 
through the 322nd for signature next week.” (MR 12.20) 
The following morning, Mr. Myers made an appearance, as confirmed by the 
coordinator.  
“Mr. Myers appeared before me to schedule the hearing for the TRO; my apologies I did 
not realize this was that same case.   We can go ahead and set the TRO with us, but most 
likely the case will be transferred prior to the hearing date and the case needs to be 
transferred prior to that date.  Mr. Myers will be emailing with dates available for the 
hearing.” (MR 12.24) 
This was followed by the following email: 
“Additionally, since there is an objection to the consolidation, y’all will need to reach out 
to request how to proceed 
with the 322nd as I am usure of their procedures.” (MR 12.25) 
Mr. Myers then promptly provided dates at 9:59 a.m. on March 28, 2025, (MR  
12.26) the hearing was agreed to be set for April 10, 2025.  (MR 12.29) Despite  
following the correct procedure, Mr. Myers was not permitted to present his  
emergency TRO, and was denied the opportunity to be heard outright because of 
the c onsolidation motion that would be filed the fol lowing week. (MR 12.20)  
In short, Mr. Myers , acting pro se , did exactly what the rules required and 
what the Court directed: he gave notice and appeared in person as instructed.  The M.2140 M.2140
M.2140 M.2140 M.2140 M.2140

17 threshol d matters should have c ame second to the be st interests of the c hildren. Se e 
Tex. Fam . Code 153. 002. (APP 5) 
That statement – “ I did n ot realize this w as that same case ” (MR 12.24)  – is a 
stunning acknowledgment of a procedural l apse. It i ndicates that t he Court fa iled to 
connect t he dot s that Mr. Myers’ new ca se concerning the c hild w as related to the 
ongoing divorce ca se. As a r esult, i nstea d of promptly hearing Mr. Myers TRO on 
its m erits, the C ourt stalled a nd im mediately c ontemplated m oving th e case a way, 
leaving M r. Myers’ emergenc y request i n limbo. The only individuals w ho 
followed proper procedure he re were t he undersigned and the court c oordinator, 
non-licensed in dividuals. (MR 12.24)  
In summary, the procedure leading up to Respondent’s abuse of discretion 
was an abuse of discretion itself, warranting the “TRO/SAPCR Mandamus” that 
was denied per curiam without any substance.  (APP 4) 
It was made ve ry clear by the 233rd court t hat the consolidation motion filed 
by the opp osing party on Ma rch 20, 2025 , was filed in the i ncorrect c ourt. (MR 5) 
(MR 12.17) This w as used a gainst M r. Myers at the 1 1th hour to prevent t he TRO 
hearing, a s show n above. The forward- looking consolidati on motion that w as used 
to justify d enying M r. Myers hi s day in court w as filed by RODERICK D. MARX, 
a non- party in either the SA PCR sui t or the di vorce m atter on April 3 , 2025. (MR 
13.5) see also (M R 7.18) M.2141 M.2141
M.2141 M.2141 M.2141 M.2141

18 Shortly thereafter, the opposing counsel emailed Mr. Myers stating:  
“This is to inform you that I will be walking through the attached Motion for 
Consolidation and Proposed Order tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m. in the 322nd for 
signature. ” (MR 12.31)  
Mr. Myers promptly replied, stating:  
“I've already objected.  
You have no legal authority to do so until you address my objection filed and 
served to you. ” (MR 12.32)  
This procedural gamesmanship is the exact reason why the undersigned opened a 
new SAPCR, as it has left the divorce to languish outside of one -sided attempts to 
pursue relief, a s clearly  pointed out in his pleadings. There has been no meaningful 
discussion on the merits of this matter with the opposing side  and no attempt to 
prosecute outside of the latest stunt to block emergency relief. (MR 1.1) From 
there, Mr. Myers filed a NOTICE OF INTENT TO SEEK MANDAMUS RELIEF in the 233
rd (MR 14) and began preparing his first mandamus brief, which was 
submitted to this court on April 10, 2024.  
I. The Respondent clearly abused his discretion he sua sponte granted RealParty’s contested consolidation motion without notice and hearing to the 
parties.  M.2142 M.2142
M.2142 M.2142 M.2142 M.2142

19 C. ABUSE OF DISCRETION
Immediately after submitting his first mandamus petition, Mr. Myers was 
served with an ORDER GRANTING CONSOLIDATION. (MR 15)  This motion, 
which was used as a barrier to relief, was granted sua sponte by the same court 
who just declined to hear an emergency TRO  before it . 
The record leaves no doubt that Respondent’s decision to consolidate the 
cases without notice or a hearing was a gross departure from the fair administration 
of justice . It is difficult to imagine a more textbook abuse of discretion: a contested  
motion was granted sua sponte , with no opportunity for the opposing party to be 
heard. This is not a close call or a minor procedural wrinkle. The facts speak for themselves – equity, due process, and basic procedural fairness were all denied in 
one fell swoop.  The only question is whether they will continue to be ignored.  
Texas courts have held that a trial court clearly abuses its discretion by 
granting a contested motion sua sponte without providing notice or a hearing. In 
D.A. Buckner Constr., Inc. v. Hobson, for example, the trial judge entered an order
(imposing sanctions) even though the affected party had no notice or opportunity to 
be heard. The court of appeals declared that order void  and emphatically stated: 
“Respondent’s order was without notice or hearing. Under these circumstances, the 
trial court’s order is void, and mandamus will lie to vacate such an order.”  Such is 
the case here. Therefore, the law should apply equally.  M.2143 M.2143
M.2143 M.2143 M.2143 M.2143

20 
 D. NO ADEQUATE REMEDY  
In determining whether an appeal is an adequate remedy,  courts have 
weighed the benefits over the detriments. In re BP Prods. N. Am., Inc ., 244 S.W.3d 
840, 845 (Tex.2008) (orig.proceeding).  A party establishes that no adequate 
appellate remedy exists by showing it is in real danger of losing its substantial 
rights. Perry v. Del Rio , 66 S.W.3d 239, 257 (Tex.2001) (orig.proceeding). As 
repeatedly stated throughout these proceedings, Relator has been deprived of the 
most fundamental rights one can have: the right to possess and protect his home, 
and the right to care for, maintain contact with, and make decisions regarding his minor children. These rights are not abstract — they are protected by the U.S. 
Constitution, the Texas Constitution, and longstanding precedent . 
E. ONGOING AND IRREPARABLE HARM  
The Texas Supreme Court has repeatedly reaffirmed that “a parent’s rights to 
the care, custody, and control of their children are constitutional in nature and must be afforded heightened protection.” In re C.J.C. , 603 S.W.3d 804, 809 (Tex. 2020).  
Likewise, property rights — including the right to remain in and possess one’s 
home — are protected under Article I, Section 19 of the Texas Constitution and the 
Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  See also  University of Tex. Med. 
Branch v. Than, 901 S.W.2d 926, 930 (Tex. 1995) M.2144 M.2144
M.2144 M.2144 M.2144 M.2144

21 When such rights are denied without valid order, hearing, or opportunity to 
be heard — as occurred here — the violation is not merely procedural: it is a 
constitutional injury , and one that warrants immediate mandamus relief . For all 
reasons incorporated herein, Mandamus should be issued , as deprivation is 
ongoing, and will occur until justice is rightfully served.  
Relator has clearly established the Respondent’s consolidation was both 
procedurally improper, and prejudicial. For all reasons incorporated herein, the  
court should uphold Texas precedent, and issue mandamus relief to restore justice 
to these proceedings.  
CONCLUSION  
With a prima facie showing of systemic abuse laid bare across the trilogy of 
mandamus petitions now before this Court, it is no longer credible to characterize 
the lower court’s conduct as isolated error. Two of the three heads of this 
procedural dragon—embodied by the 233rd, the 322nd, and this very Court—have 
already rendered per curiam denials, offering no explanation in the face of 
documented, unrebutted misconduct. The record in each petition stands 
unopposed. No adversary response has been filed. No evidentiary challenge has 
been made. The silence against Relator’s claims is not merely strategic—it is 
telling. A dangerous precedent is being forged in silence. This court must act.M.2145 M.2145
M.2145 M.2145 M.2145 M.2145

22 PRAYER  
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Relator CHARLES DUSTIN 
MYERS respectfully prays that this Honorable Court:  
1.Issue a writ of mandamus compelling the Hon. Kenneth Newell, Judge of
the 233rd District Court, to vacate the April 2025 consolidation order, as itwas entered sua sponte  on a contested  motion;
2.Take judicial notice of the procedural irregularities and record- supported
adversity faced by Relator throughout these proceedings, including the
refusal to hear his emergency TRO while simultaneously granting relief to
the opposing party;
3.Grant all other relief to which Relator may be justly entitled, at law or inequity, in light of the extraordinary circumstances and ongoing deprivationof due process.
Relator has before this Court three petitions for writ of mandamus. Two have
already been denied per curiam without explanation —perhaps the result of routine 
disregard for pro se filings. But on rehearing, this Court is urged to evaluate this 
petition in c onjunction with its sister mandamuses to fully grasp the depth of 
systemic abuse, procedural evasion, and judicial inconsistency present in the courts 
below.  M.2146 M.2146
M.2146 M.2146 M.2146 M.2146

23 Individually, each mandamus reveals a failure of 
process. Together, they form a “Dragon in Triplicate” — 
a coordinated denial of justice across courts that were 
sworn to protect it.

4 ISSUES PRESENTED FOR RECONSIDERATION  
Rehearing Issue No. 1: 
According to the Texas Supreme Court, mandamus may issue to compel a 
judge to perform a ministerial act. The panel erred by overlooking that the trial court had a legal duty to act, that a demand for performance was made, 
and that the court refused to rule.  
Rehearing Issue No. 2: 
The pa nel erred by overlooking  that the burden for mandamus was satisfied. 
The mandamus and supplemental records establish  a prima facie showing 
that an emergency TRO was properly filed, a date and time to present the 
motion was secured, opposing counsel participated in scheduling the full 
hearing, and the trial court declined to proceed, resulting in no ruling or 
order.  M.2159 M.2159
M.2159 M.2159 M.2159 M.2159

5 TO THE HONORABLE SECOND  COURT OF APPEALS:  
Relator CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS respectfully moves this Honorable 
Court for en banc reconsideration of the panel decisions rendered in three separate 
but interwoven mandamus proceedings to be presented for reconsideration in the 
following order:  
i.Cause No. 02- 25-00166 -CV (denied April 14, 2025) (“V oid Order”)
ii.Cause No. 02 -25-00171- CV (denied April 17, 2025) (“Consolidation”)
iii.Cause No. 02- 25-00164- CV (denied April 11, 2025) (“SAPCR/TRO”)
This motion serves as  the third filed reconsideration motion and addresses 
the panel’s denial of Cause No. 02-25-00164-CV (attached as Tab  A), referred to as 
the “SAPCR” mandamus.  It is respectfully submitted that the panel’s per curiam 
dismissal overlooked substantial, uncontested factual inaccuracies and manifest 
procedural deficiencies meticulously substantiated within the mandamus and 
supplemental mandamus records. Such judicial oversight necessitates 
comprehensive en banc scrutiny to preserve jurisprudential coherence and fidelity 
to established precedents of Texas law. 
Relator welcomes a response from the Real Party or Respondent if such 
would provide meaningful insight into the situation.M.2160 M.2160
M.2160 M.2160 M.2160 M.2160

6 STATEMENT  OF FACTS  
On March 19, 2025, Relator filed a SAPCR as an original proceeding in the 
233rd District Court of Tarrant County which was subsequently answered by 
counsel for Real Party in Interest  the following day . (MR 3).  An emergency TRO 
was later filed on March 24, 2025, in the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County. 
(MR 7, MR 7.26) The trial court was asked to perform a ministerial duty when a 
date and time was secured to present the motion. (SUPP 2.11, SUPP 2.24, SUPP 
2.26) . The undersigned appeared on March 28, 2025, and it is undeniable that the 
full hearing was set for April 10, 2025, at 9:30a.m. The judge refused to hear the  
motion . Accordingly, no appealable order was issued.   
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT  
It is clear that the trial court below had a ministerial duty to act and refused 
to do so. When a trial court fails to rule on a motion that is properly filed and 
brought to its attention, the abuse of discretion is established as a matter of law. This aligns with longstanding mandamus jurisprudence , which requires only three 
elements  to establish a clear abuse of discretion : the existence of a legal duty to 
act, a clear request for that action, and the court’s failure or refusal to do so.  In re 
Shredder C o., L.L.C., 225 S.W.3d 676, 679 (Tex. App. - El Paso 2006, orig.  
proceeding); Stoner v. Massey , 586 S.W.2d 843, 846 (Tex. 1979).  All three 
elements are present here.  M.2161 M.2161
M.2161 M.2161 M.2161 M.2161

7 ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITY 
I. Although disfavored in routine matters, en banc reconsideration is
appropriate  where the legal standard is met, as it is here.
En banc  reconsideration is reserved for the rare case that satisfies one or 
both of the “hard- to-satisfy requirements” set forth in Texas Rule of Appellate 
Procedure 41.2(c): ensuring uniformity in the court’s decisions or addressing 
extraordinary circumstances. The Texas Supreme Court has endorsed this narrow 
standard, cautioning against overuse to preserve judicial efficiency and ensure that 
“the appellate trains... run on time.” See In re Marriage of Harrison , 507 S.W.3d 
259, 260 –61 (Tex. App. —[14th Dist.] 2016) (Frost, J., dissenting).   
Here, this  is precisely the kind of novel case that warrants en banc  
reconsideration. T he panel’s decision threatens a  fundamental departure  from 
settled Texas law —made more urgent by the fact that the emergency relief sought 
is on behalf of two minor children  and remains unopposed by any party at the time 
of filing this motion.  
Further, the subject matter of this case —three concurrently pending 
mandamus proceedings, all arising from distinct but interconnected abuses of discretion —constitutes an extraordinary circumstance. Each petition was denied 
per curiam  by the same panel  despite a clearly established record of procedural 
violations and judicial inaction. The en banc  court should examine and correct the M.2162 M.2162
M.2162 M.2162 M.2162 M.2162

8 panel’s cursory denials to ensure that this Court’s precedent does not inadvertently 
endorse or perpetuate abuses of discretion that have been thoroughly documented 
across the mandamus and supplemental records without any opposition.  
II. The panel’s per curiam  denial conflicts with controlling authority and
overlooks critical facts established in the mandamus and
supplemental mandamus records .
"When a motion is properly filed and pending before the trial court, the act 
of givi ng consideration to and ruling upon that motion is a ministerial act, and 
mandamus may issue to compel the trial judge to act."  Safety -Kleen Corp. v. 
Garcia , 945 S.W.2d 268, 269 (Tex. App. - San Antonio 1997, orig. proceeding).  
However, the Relator  must demonstrate  that the trial court abused its discretion by 
failing or refusing to perform  a ministerial act.  
A.The trial court abused its discretion by failing to rule on a properly filed
motion after being asked to act.
To establish an abuse of discretion, the Relator must show that the trial court 
received a properly filed motion, was made aware of it, and was asked to rule —
whether through direct correspondence or other documents drawing the court’s 
attention to the matt er. See In re Villarreal, 96 S.W.3d 708, 710 (Tex. App. —
Amarillo 2003, orig. proceeding).  
Here, t he email correspondence between the court coordinator of the 233rd 
District Court,  counsel for R eal Party, and the undersigned found in SUPP 2.17-
2.22 clearly demonstrates that: 1) a motion was filed and properly before the court M.2163 M.2163
M.2163 M.2163 M.2163 M.2163

9 
 without objection ; 2) the undersigned appeared in person at a designated time and 
requested the court rule on his motion with a full trial setting secured for April 10, 
2025; 3) the court refused to rule on  the motion .  
Therefore, the trial court clearly abused its discretion by refusing to perform 
a ministerial act after being properly asked to rule on a pending motion, which is 
well supported in the verified supplemental mandamus record.  When a motion has 
been properly filed and brought to the attention of the trial court, the act of considering and ruling upon the motion is ministerial in nature, and mandamus 
may issue to compel the trial court to act.  See In re Layton, 257 S.W.3d 794, 795 (Tex. App. — Amarillo 2008, orig. proceeding).   
B. By refusing to act, the Relator was left without an adequate remedy for an appeal.  
By refusing to rule, no order was issued . This left the undersigned without 
an adequate remedy by appeal and thus satisfies the standard for mandamus relief. 
See In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. , 148 S.W.3d 124, 135 (Tex. 2004). In other 
words, there is no adequate remedy at law for a trial court's failure to rule because  "[f]undamental requirements of due process mandate an opportunity to be 
heard."  See In re Christensen , 39 S.W.3d 250, 251 (Tex. App. —Amarillo  2000, 
orig. proceeding). Here, those fundamental requirements were not satisfied , 
resulting in these proceedings.  M.2164 M.2164
M.2164 M.2164 M.2164 M.2164

10 
 CONCLUSION AND PRAYER  
Considering the facts incorporated herein, t he en banc  court should revisit 
the denial issued by the panel on April 11, 2025. (attached as Tab 1) It remains 
undisputed that an emergency motion was before the  trial court  (MR 7) the trial 
court was asked to rule on that motion, and the trial court refused to do so.  
The undersigned, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, therefore,  respectfully 
prays that this Court grant en banc  reconsideration, withdraw or vacate the panel’s 
per curiam  denial , and remand this cause back to the 233rd District Court of Tarrant 
County for further proceedings consistent with law and justice. In doing so, the 
undersigned asks this Court to consider not only the record in this case, but the 
totality of the circumstances presented across all three pending  en banc  motions—
each evidencing distinct but interlocking abuses of discretion that have left him 
without an adequate appellate remedy . The Triplicate of per curiam denials should 
be reconsidered. Relator holds deep respect for the judiciary, the judges of this 
Court, and all parties involved, and trusts that neither his zealous advocacy nor his 
self-represented status detracts from the merits of the arguments presented.

I. INTRODUCTION AND ISSUE PRESENTED  
A. Overview of the Case  
This report examines whether the Temporary Orders signed on March 26, 2024, 
in Cause No. 322-744263- 23 (322nd District Court, Tarrant County) are facially void or 
legally invalid. Evidence indicates serious procedural irregularities in how the Associate 
Judge's Reports from February 1, 2024, and March 14, 2024, were handled.  
The case involves a family law matter between Morgan Myers (Petitioner) and 
Charles Myers (Respondent). The procedural history reveals a concerning pattern of deviations from standard legal practice and explicit judicial directives. Of particular concern are the following newly uncovered facts:  
The February 1, 2024,  Associate Judge's Report required a typed Temporary 
Orders conforming to the report to be prepared by attorney Dan Bacalis within 20 days, approved by both attorneys within 5 days, and set for entry ("motion to sign") within 30 days if no agreement.  
The order filed  (March 26, 2024 Temporary Orders) was prepared well past the 
20-day/30-day deadlines – in fact about 44 days later – and by Cooper L. Carter 
(opposing counsel) instead of Dan Bacalis. It was not reviewed or approved by Charles's attorney (Bacalis had ceased representing Charles by then), and Charles was pressured to 
sign it immediately on March 26, 2024, under threat of adverse action, rather than being 
given the 5- day review period the Associate Judge had ordered  and the parties actually 
had agreed to.  
The March 14, 2024,  Associate Judge's Report contains handwritten directives 
written by opposing counsel, not the judge, including a coercive ultimatum that final orders must be presented by 1:30 PM that same day. The report notes that Charles objected to the form of the proposed order and refused to approve Paragraph 3 – 
evidencing that no true agreement on all terms existed.  
B. Issue Presented  M.2177 M.2177
M.2177 M.2177 M.2177 M.2177

This research paper addresses the following central question: Do these procedural 
failures – including non-compliance with the Associate Judge's instructions, lack of 
required signatures/approvals, and coerced "consent" – render the February 1 and March 
14 reports never properly converted into a valid court order, and thus make the March 26, 
2024,  Temporary Orders facially void or otherwise invalid?  
The analysis will address the governing law (Texas Family Code provisions, 
Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and case law) and analyze potential due process 
violations. The paper will also discuss remedies, including whether mandamus relief or other direct attacks are appropriate to vacate the orders.  
II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
A. February 1, 2024 – Associate Judge's Hearing and Report  
On February 1, 2024, an Associate Judge never heard Petitioner Morgan Myers's 
motion for temporary orders.  The purpose of the setting was for Petitioner to produce 
evidence of her family violence claims. According to the Associate Judge's Report for 
Temporary Orders signed that day, both parties appeared with counsel. The report recites 
that Petitioner (Morgan) and Respondent (Charles) "signed an Associate Judge's Report 
regarding Agreed Temporary Orders. " In other words, the Associate Judge’s Report for 
Temporary Orders was represented as an agreed order. 
Notably, however, the February 1 report itself was not a final typed order; it was a 
handwritten form that Dan Bacalis, not the Associate Judge, completed. Crucially, at the 
end of the hearing the Associate Judge did not enter a final written order but instead set out a procedure to finalize one:  
1. A typed Temporary Order conforming to the Associate Judge's Report was to be prepared within 20 days of February 1, 2024. The report explicitly says: "A typed written Order conforming to this Report will follow within 20 days from the date 
this Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be prepared by [Dan Bacalis]."  M.2178 M.2178
M.2178 M.2178 M.2178 M.2178

2. Each attorney was to approve the order, with 5 days for review. The report states: 
"Each attorney should approve the Order. The parties do not need to approve the Order. The attorney reviewing the proposed Order shall have five (5) days to do 
so." Thus, both Morgan's and Charles's attorneys were required to sign off as to 
form; the parties' signatures on the final typed version were not strictly required 
by this instruction (since it says parties "do not need to approve"), but the initial report it self cont emplated an agreed order and included signature lines for the 
parties as evidence of their agreement. In practice, for an agreed family order it is standard that both parties and counsel sign "Approved as to Form and Substance."  
3. If the attorneys could not agree on the form of order, a "Motion to Sign" hearing was to be set within 30 days of February 1. The report directs: "If an agreement is not reached, a Motion to Sign shall be filed and set within thirty (30) days from the signing of this Report." This meant by approximately March 2, 2024, any 
dispute about the order's wording or contents should be brought to the court for 
resolution.  
Finally, the February 1 Associate Judge's Report has an "AGREED AS TO FORM 
AND SUBSTANCE" signature block for the parties and attorneys.  
The Associate Judge did sign the report on February 1, making the report effective as 
an interim order of the court. Under Texas Family Code § 201.013, a signed Associate 
Judge's proposed order is in full force and effect pending any request for a de novo 
hearing by the referring court. No request for a de novo hearing was filed by either party 
within the 3 -working-day window (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.015(a)). Therefore, the 
Associate Judge's rulings of February 1 became the governing temporary orders in effect  
– but only in the form of the handwritten report, pending entry of the formal typed order.  
B. March 14, 2024 – Attempt to Finalize Order and Second AJ's Report  
By early March 2024, no agreed typed order had been submitted or signed. Dan 
Bacalis (Charles's attorney) did not prepare the order within 20 days, nor was a Motion to M.2179 M.2179
M.2179 M.2179 M.2179 M.2179

Sign filed within 30 days. In fact, during this period Charles's counsel was terminated  
from representation just four days after the associate judge’s report was signed on 
February 1. To address the basis for any agreement being fraudulent, Charles promptly 
filed an emergency motion to reconsider evidence and vacate any agreement, which was eventually set for March 14 due to Cooper Carter’s availability.  
At the March 14 proceeding, instead of simply holding an entry hearing, the 
court and counsel engaged in off -the-record discussions to get the order finalized. 
Opposing counsel (Cooper Carter) took it upon herself  to hand-write the directives on a 
new Associate Judge's Report form. These handwritten notes (penned by Carter, not the judge) included a coercive instruction that Charles must sign the final order by 1:30 PM 
that same day (March 14).  
Essentially, Charles was given an ultimatum to immediately acquiesce to the 
written order's terms. The March 14 report also documented that Charles objected to the form of the order and specifically did not approve Paragraph 3 (a provision in the draft 
order). In other words, as of March 14 there was not a full meeting of the minds – Charles 
had an unresolved objection to at least one substantive term. Despite this, the pressure was on to finalize the order that day , and the purpose of being there was for a n entire 
different purpose.  
Importantly, the handwritten March 14 notes were not written by the judge and 
were not traditional judicial findings or rulings – they were more in the nature of 
instructions and a deadline apparently dictated by opposing counsel. There is no 
indication th e Associate Judge held an evidentiary hearing on March 14 or made 
independent findings; instead, it appears the goal was simply to force execution of the 
previously "agreed" temporary order that had essentially been nullified by Dan Bacalis’ departure from  the case.  
C. March 26, 2024 – Filing of the Temporary Orders and Circumstances of Signing 
On March 26, 2024, a typed "Temporary Orders" document was finally filed with the 
District Clerk. This document, which spans numerous pages, purports to memorialize the M.2180 M.2180
M.2180 M.2180 M.2180 M.2180

temporary conservatorship, possession, and injunction terms that were discussed back on 
February 1. The key points about this March 26, 2024 Temporary Orders are:  
1. It was drafted by Cooper L. Carter, counsel for Morgan (as evidenced by the signature block indicating Carter's authorship and by the fact that Bacalis was no longer involved). This violated the Associate Judge's explicit instruction that Dan Bacalis would  prepare the order. In effect, opposing counsel unilaterally drafted 
the order.  
2. It was prepared and filed well after the 20 -day deadline set by the February 1 
report. Nearly two months had elapsed (far beyond the expected February 21 
deadline for drafting and March 2 deadline for a motion to sign). No extension or 
modification of the Associate Judge's timeline was on record. Thus, the order was 
untimely under the terms of the February 1 directive.  
3. Critically, the order was not reviewed or approved by Charles Myers's attorney. By the time the order was drafted in late March, Charles had no attorney of record (Bacalis did not sign the order and had withdrawn). The February 1 report's procedure – requi ring each attorney to approve within 5 days – became 
impossible to follow, since Charles had no counsel to review the draft. Carter did not seek approval from any attorney on Charles's side. In fact, the signature block shows Dan Bacalis's signature line b lank (he did not sign off because he wasn't 
even on the case).  
4. The March 26 order was presented to Charles for his signature on extremely short notice (apparently on the same day). Charles did not sign the order. He was essentially confronted with the final order and told to sign immediately (recall the March 14 "1:30 PM deadline" threat) or face adverse consequences (the 
implication being the judge would sign it without his consent or possibly hold him in contempt or consider him uncooperative). Feeling coerced and with no counsel to advise him, Charles signed "Approved and Consented to as to Form and Substance" on March 26, 2024 – but this signature was not truly voluntary. It 
was done under protest to avoid an even worse outcome. It is telling that Charles M.2181 M.2181
M.2181 M.2181 M.2181 M.2181

had explicitly refused to approve the same order's Paragraph 3 on March 14, yet 
by March 26 he capitulated and signed – a strong indicator of coercion rather 
than genuine agreement.  
5. The recitals in the March 26 Temporary Orders are misleading. The order opens by reciting that both parties appeared on February 1 and "signed an Associate Judge's Report regarding Agreed Temporary Orders", and that "The parties have 
agreed to the terms of this order as evidenced by the signatures below."  While 
Morgan and her counsel indeed signed the report, Charles's signature was not on 
that report, so that recital is factually inaccurate. Thus, the very foundation – that 
the order is an agreed order – i s incorrect. 
In summary, the March 26, 2024,  Temporary Orders were entered following a 
process in which the Associate Judge's explicit procedures were not observed, one party's counsel was no longer involved to approve the order, and the other party's consent was 
effectively forced. 
III. LEGAL FRAMEWORK  
A. Authority of Associate Judges and Requirements for Temporary Orders  
Associate Judge's Orders and Reports (Texas Family Code Ch. 201)  
In Texas family law cases, an associate judge may hear temporary orders matters 
and issue a report or even render an order, but certain procedures apply. Under Tex. 
Family Code § 201.011, an associate judge's report must be in writing and in the form directed by the referring court. The associate judge can include a proposed order in the 
report. After the hearing, notice of the substance of the report must be given to the parties 
(which can be done in open court, as happened on February 1).  
Crucially, parties have a right to request a de novo hearing before the referring 
District Judge within a short window (generally 3 working days for temporary orders in SAPCR cases) after receiving notice of the associate judge's report. See Tex. Fam. Code § 
201.015(a). If no timely de novo hearing is requested, the associate judge's proposed M.2182 M.2182
M.2182 M.2182 M.2182 M.2182

order may be adopted and enforced as an order of the district court. In fact, pending any 
de novo request, the associate judge's proposed order is in full effect as an order of the court (Tex. Fam. Code § 201.013(a)). This legal mechanism is intended to gi ve 
immediate effect to temporary rulings, while allowing a quick review by the district judge if a party is dissatisfied.  
An associate judge has authority to "render and sign... a temporary order" in a 
SAPCR or divorce case. Tex. Fam. Code § 201.007(a)(14)(C) expressly so provides. The associate judge can also sign a final order if it is agreed in writing by all parties as to  both 
form and substance. In other words, the statute recognizes that a true agreed order (with all parties signing off) can be signed by the associate judge and will carry the same 
weight as if the district judge signed it. For contested matters, typically the associate 
judge issues a report and proposed order for the district judge to sign, unless no party objects (in which case the associate judge's order often effectively becomes final after the de novo period).  
Requirements for Temporary Orders (Tex. Family Code § 105.001)  
Section 105.001 of the Family Code governs temporary orders in suits affecting 
the parent -child relationship. It broadly allows a court to make temporary orders for the 
safety and welfare of the child (e.g., conservatorship, support, restraining certain behavior, etc.). However, it also imposes certain procedural safeguards. For example, except in emergencies, temporary orders (like those appointing conservators or ordering support) can only be issued after notice and a hearing.  
Notably, a temporary order that excludes a parent from possession of or access to 
a child (as happened here, since Charles was forced out of the home and effectively had limited access) cannot be rendered without a verified pleading or affidavit showing the 
requisite facts (essentially a showing of immediate danger to the child). This is to ensure 
a parent is not denied access without due process and evidentiary support. In our case, the initial February 1 hearing was tied to a protective order application,  so there likely were 
affidavits/pleadings on file – but whether evidence was presented is disputed. Regardless, 
the overarching principle is that due process must be afforded in temporary orders.  M.2183 M.2183
M.2183 M.2183 M.2183 M.2183

B. Agreed Orders and Rule 11  
Texas strongly favors parties resolving issues by agreement, but any agreement 
touching a pending lawsuit must satisfy Rule 11, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure to be 
enforceable. Rule 11 requires agreements to be either (1) in writing, signed by the parties or their attorneys, and filed with the court, or (2) made on the record in open court. An "Agreed Temporary Order" is essentially a Rule 11 agreement on the interim issues, 
incorporated into a court order. If one party does not actually consent or withdra ws 
consent before the court renders the order, then there is no valid agreement to support an 
agreed order.  
Texas case law is clear that a court cannot render a valid agreed judgment or 
order without the genuine consent of both parties at the time of rendition. If a party revokes consent or never consented in the first place, the agreed judgment is improper. As the Texas Supreme Court has held in Burnaman v. Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288 (Tex. 1951), a 
judgment purporting to be a consent judgment, but actually rendered without consent, is 
void. Similarly, in S&A Restaurant Corp. v. Leal , 892 S.W.2d 855, 857 (Tex. 1995),  the 
court confirmed that a party may revoke consent any time before judgment is rendered.  
C. Relevant Statutory Provisions and Case Law  
The legal analysis in this paper draws upon the following key statutory provisions 
and case law:  
• Texas Family Code § 201.007(a)(14)(C) : Authorizes associate judges to render 
and sign temporary orders.  
• Texas Family Code § 201.011: Requirements for associate judge's reports. 
• Texas Family Code § 201.013: Effect of associate judge's report pending de novo hearing.  
• Texas Family Code § 201.015(a) : Time frame for requesting de novo hearing.  M.2184 M.2184
M.2184 M.2184 M.2184 M.2184

• Texas Family Code § 105.001: Requirements for temporary orders in SAPCR 
cases.  
• Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 11 : Requirements for enforceable 
agreements.  
• Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 305 : Procedure for submission of 
proposed judgments.  
Key cases that inform this analysis include: 
• Burnaman v. Heaton , 240 S.W.2d 288 (Tex. 1951): A judgment purporting to be 
a consent judgment but rendered without consent is void.  
• S&A Restaurant Corp. v. Leal , 892 S.W.2d 855, 857 (Tex. 1995): Party may 
revoke consent any time before judgment rendered.  
• In re Stephanie Lee , 411 S.W.3d 445, 450 (Tex. 2013): Court must enforce valid 
agreements but has no discretion to impose an agreement if not statutorily compliant or if no genuine agreement exists.  
• Page v. Sherrill, 415 S.W.2d 642 (Tex. 1967): Mandamus granted where 
temporary custody order issued without notice and hearing violated due process.  
• In re Stearns , 202 S.W.3d 414 (Tex. App. –Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, orig. 
proceeding): Mandamus relief where trial court's temporary orders effectively changed custody without proper notice/evidence.  
• In re C.J.C. , 603 S.W.3d 804 (Tex. 2020): Reaffirming the fundamental right of 
a fit parent and that any order infringing that right must have compelling justification. 
• In re Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. , 35 S.W.3d 602, 605 (Tex. 2000): If an order is 
void, mandamus relief is available without showing inadequate remedy by appeal.  M.2185 M.2185
M.2185 M.2185 M.2185 M.2185

• O'Neil v. Blake , 86 S.W.3d 538, 541 (Tex. App. –Dallas 2002, no pet.): Consent 
judgment valid only if parties consent at time of rendition; trial court should not 
enter agreed order if one party's attorney did not sign it and party objected.  
IV . ANALYSIS OF PROCEDURAL IRREGULARITIES  
A. Failure to Follow Associate Judge's Explicit Procedures  
The February 1, 2024 Associate Judge's Report established a clear procedure for 
finalizing the Temporary Orders. This procedure was not followed in several critical 
respects:  
1. Preparation by Wrong Attorney : The Associate Judge explicitly directed that 
Dan Bacalis (Charles's attorney) would prepare the typed order within 20 days. Instead, Cooper L. Carter (Morgan's attorney) prepared the order. This is a direct 
contravention of the court's instruction. The c ourt's designation of a specific 
attorney to draft the order was not a mere suggestion but a directive. When a court specifies which attorney will draft an order, it is typically to ensure fairness and balance in the drafting process. By having opposing counsel draft the order 
instead, the court's intent was undermined, and the resulting document may 
reflect a bias toward Morgan's interests.  
2. Missed Deadlines : The Associate Judge set clear deadlines: 20 days for 
preparation of the typed order (approximately February 21, 2024) and 30 days for a Motion to Sign if agreement could not be reached (approximately March 2, 2024). The final order was not prepared until  March 26, 2024 – approximately 54 
days after the February 1 hearing. This delay of nearly two months exceeds both 
deadlines by a substantial margin. No extension of these deadlines appears in the 
record. The court's timeline was not merely  advisory; it was a binding directive 
that established the parameters for finalizing the order. The failure to adhere to these deadlines constitutes a procedural irregularity that calls into question the validity of the resulting order.  M.2186 M.2186
M.2186 M.2186 M.2186 M.2186

3. No Attorney Approval : The Associate Judge directed that each attorney should 
approve the order, with a 5 -day review period. By the time the order was 
prepared, Charles no longer had counsel of record. Dan Bacalis had withdrawn 
from representation and did not sign the final or der. This means the order was 
never reviewed or approved by an attorney representing Charles's interests, as 
explicitly required by the Associate Judge. The requirement for attorney approval serves an important purpose: ensuring that the written order accurately reflects 
what was agreed or ordered at the hearing. Without this safeguard, there is no 
assurance that the final document faithfully represents the court's rulings or any agreement between the parties. 
4. No Motion to Sign Hearing : The Associate Judge directed that if agreement 
could not be reached on the form of the order, a Motion to Sign should be filed and set within 30 days. No such motion was filed, despite the fact that Charles objected to at least one provision (Paragraph 3) of the proposed order on March 14, 2024. Instead of following this procedure for resolving disagreements, 
opposing counsel and the court apparently attempted to force Charles's 
acquiescence through coercive means. The Motion to S ign procedure is designed 
to provide a formal mechanism for resolving disputes about the form of an order. By bypassing this process, the court denied Charles the opportunity to present his 
objections in a proper procedural context.  
These procedural failures are not mere technicalities. They represent significant 
deviations from the court's own directives and from standard legal practice. The Associate Judge's instructions were designed to ensure a fair and orderly process for 
finaliz ing the Temporary Orders. By disregarding these instructions, the parties and the 
court undermined the integrity of the process and cast doubt on the validity of the resulting order.  
B. Lack of Valid Consent to Support an "Agreed" Order  M.2187 M.2187
M.2187 M.2187 M.2187 M.2187

The M arch 26, 20 24 Temporary Orders pur port to be an "Agreed" or der, a s 
evidenced  by the recitals and t he signature blocks. Ho wever, sev eral f actors indicate that 
there was no valid consent to support an agreed order: 
1. Missing Signatures
The March 26, 2 024 Associate Judge' s Report r ecites t hat b oth p arties "signed an 
Associate Judge's Report r egarding Agreed Temporary Or ders" an d that " The parties have 
agreed t o the terms of t his order as evidenced b y the signatures belo w." Ho wever, C harles 
Myers's signature is notably ab sent f rom t he report. This discrepancy  between t he recital 
and t he actual si gnatures calls into q uestion wh ether Charles ever ag reed t o the terms in 
the first p lace. 
The absen ce of Charles's signature on t he report i s particularly si gnificant 
because the report i tself st ates that t he parties' ag reement wo uld b e "evidenced b y [their] 
signatures." Without C harles's signature, t here is no ev idence of h is agreement as 
contemplated b y the report i tself. This creat es a fundamental i nconsistency: t he document 
claims to b e based o n an ag reement ev idenced b y signatures, y et one party's signature is 
missing. 
2. Objection No t Reso lved
As of M arch 14, 2 024, C harles e xplicitly objected t o Paragraph 3 of t he or der a nd 
refused to approve i t. This i s doc umented in the M arch 14 Associate J udge's R eport. This 
objection i s clear ev idence that Charles had n ot co nsented t o all terms of t he would -be 
agreed order. When a pa rty voi ces a n objection to the f orm or s ubstance of a j udgment 
before i t is signed, t he proper c ourse i s for the court t o refrain from e ntering it a s an 
agreed judgment. 
In family cas es, ei ther p arty can r evok e consent t o an agreement an y time before 
the judge s igns t he or der. Charles's conduct on March 14 amounted to either a n on-
consent or r evocation of a ny prior t entative c onsent r egarding that disputed term. 
Therefore, at t hat poi nt, the m atter c eased to be f ully agreed. U nder Texas l aw, the judge 
could only proceed by either obt aining a ne w agreement or b y treating it a s a contested M.2188 M.2188
M.2188 M.2188 M.2188 M.2188

matter. F orcing the pa rty to sign under t hreat i s not a va lid option. If c onsent i s 
withdrawn, t he court can not render an ag reed o rder – doing so is a n abuse of di scretion 
and the or der will be voi d because one pa rty's c onsent w as lacking at r endition. 
3. Coerced S ignature = No Rea l Consent
Charles' s signature on February 1 was obtained u nder duress. He was effectively 
given an u ltimatum: si gn immediately o r face some unspecified b ut presumably sev ere 
consequence. Consent obt ained thro ugh coercion, t hreats, or dur ess is not va lid consent. 
In contract l aw, an agreement s igned under dur ess c an be voi ded. I n judgment 
law, a party' s forced assen t is no assen t at al l – it is akin t o no agreement. Her e, Charles 
did not w illingly approve t he or der's s ubstance; he r elented to pressure from h is own 
counsel. This calls into q uestion t he voluntariness of t he agreed o rder. Texas courts have 
noted t hat ag reed j udgments are essentially co ntracts approved by t he court. Ju st as a 
contract s igned under dur ess is voi dable, an agreed judgment s igned under d uress s hould 
not be gi ven effect. The i ntegrity of t he judicial pr ocess i s unde rmined if one pa rty is 
bullied into signing a j udgment. 
4. Absent Attorney for Charles
Charles was pro se by March 14, without the benefit of counsel to advise him. 
This made him more vulnerable to coercion and means there was no attorney on his side 
agreeing to t he order's terms. M organ's attorney d rafted i t and of co urse agreed t o it; 
Charles ha d no attorney to negotiate or e nsure f airness. The di sparity in representation 
and the r ushed nature of t he signing further i ndicate t he "agreement" w as one -sided. 
Essentiall y, the M arch 26 document w as M organ (through he r attorney) a greeing with 
herself an d getting C harles's signature as a formality. That i s not a true meeting  of minds. 
Under t hese circumstances, t he March 2 6 Temporary Or ders cannot b e 
considered a valid ag reed o rder. I t was a unilateral o rder i mposed o n Charles with a 
veneer o f consent. I n Texas, wh en a judgment i s recited as agreed b ut in fact o ne party 
did not c onsent, the r emedy is ty pically to s et it aside. For in stance, in Samples 
Exterminators, t he Texas S upreme C ourt he ld the a greed judgment void whe n one pa rty's M.2189 M.2189
M.2189 M.2189 M.2189 M.2189

consent was lacking. Likewise, in divorce cases, if one party withdraws consent to a 
mediated settlement, the trial court cannot enter it as a judgment (see Burnaman v. Heaton , 240 S.W.2d 288 (Tex. 1951) – a decades-old case still often cited for the 
proposition that a judge has no authority to impose an agreement on a party who has repudiated it prior to judgment). Here, Charles's actions are tantamount to having never truly c onsented or having repudiated any earlier tentative consent.  
In sum, the final Temporary Orders are built on a false premise of party consent. 
On their face, they recite an agreement and show signatures, but the surrounding record shows Charles's signature and his attorney's signature is missing. This kind of discrepancy is something an appellate court or any reviewing court would look at with 
great concern. Facially, the order proclaims an agreement that did not actually exist – that 
is a strong indicator of invalidity. A judgment that misstates the existence of an agreement 
is at least voidable, if not void, because the court's authority to render that particular agreed judgment was never triggered by an actual agreement of the parties.  
C. Non -Conformance to the Court's Actual Rulings – Possible Substantive Variances  
Another question is whether the March 26 order fails to conform to what the 
Associate Judge ordered  on February 1. If the final written order includes provisions that 
were never agreed to or never ruled on by the judge, it is improper. Charles's objection to Paragraph 3 suggests he believed that portion of the order was not agreed or not ordered on February 1. Indeed, reviewing the text of the Temporary Orders, Paragraph 3 (and related provisions) deals with the parents using the "AppClose" program for 
communication and sharing information. It is unclear if this specific requirement was 
discussed on February 1 or if it was an added term Carter inserted in the written draft. Often, such  app requirements are agreed to by parties or ordered by judges to facilitate 
communication. If Charles objected, perhaps he felt it was beyond what was decided at 
the hearing.  
Furthermore, initially, the Feb 1 report gave Charles access to the family 
residence until March 1, 2024 and took the children out of their own home. On the March 26 report, the dates suddenly shifted, actually creating a window where nobody would be M.2190 M.2190
M.2190 M.2190 M.2190 M.2190

inside the home . Perhaps most egregious, is that on March 6th, 2024, prior to this hearing 
being held, Mother locked Father out of the family residence.  
Since the final order went beyond the scope of the February 1 hearing and  
imposed new obligations not covered in the AJ's oral pronouncement, the proper course 
would have been to litigate those terms (or at least for the judge to confirm both sides agreed). By unilaterally adding it and forcing Charles's signature, the order contains 
terms to which there was never a true assent or judicial determination. In Texas, a written 
judgment must conform to the court's oral rendition (or the parties' agreement). Whe n it 
does not, that portion of the judgment is subject to being set aside or reformed. Here, we lack a transcript of February 1, but given Charles's resistance and the blatant differences 
in the two reports, there is no agreement.  That means the final order, at least in part, does 
not reflect the actual "report" of the judge but rather what opposing counsel wanted, 
which is highly prejudicial.  
Additionally, because the final order was delayed, by March 26 the Associate 
Judge did not personally "render" those orders – he had made recommendations on 
February 1, but the actual signing on March 26 was by the Associate Judge. If the District 
Judge signed it believing it was agreed, when in fact it was not, then the District Judge was essentially misled. The district court has authority to enter temporary orders after an 
AJ's hearing, but if it's contested, the district court should know it's contested. Here, 
labeling it "Agreed" circumvented any further hearing by the district court. That implicates due process again – Charles never had a de novo hearing because it was never 
presented as a contested matter; the "agreed" label short -circuited his ability to get the 
referring court to hear his side.  
In conclusion on this point, the content of the March 26 order exceeds or deviates 
from what was legitimately agreed or ordered on the record, making those portions of the 
order unauthorized. An order that a court had no power to make (because the party di dn't 
consent and no evidence was taken on that issue) is invalid. At the very least, it's an abuse 
of discretion to include terms not supported by the hearing. This is another reason the order is vulnerable to attack.  M.2191 M.2191
M.2191 M.2191 M.2191 M.2191

D. Due Process Violations and Equity  
Beyond the technical rule violations, the manner in which these temporary orders 
were obtained raises serious due process concerns:  
1. No Meaningful Opportunity to be Heard on Disputed Terms  
Charles was not afforded a real chance to argue against Paragraph 3 or any other 
disputed provision. The March 14 "hearing" was a farce in terms of due process – instead 
of an impartial judge considering his objection, he got an opposing counsel's ultimatum. 
The next step should have been a hearing before the district judge (since the AJ process 
had broken down into disagreement). By never allowing Charles a forum to voice why he objected (e.g.,  the changed dates, incorrect mailing address, etc. ), the court  denied him 
the basic hearing on that issue. Temporary orders, while expedited, still require that each party can present their case on any point of contention. This did not happen.  
 
2. Surprise and Lack of Notice  
The attempted  final order was pushed through on March 26 without prior notice 
to Charles of an "entry" setting. Typically, when an order is to be entered, especially if the 
form isn't agreed, the party is entitled to notice  when the judge will sign it and what 
version is being submitted. Here, Charles was ambushed with a sign-now scenario. That 
is arguably a violation of local rules or at least the spirit of Rule 305, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, which contemplates notice to all parties of the presentation of a judgm ent for 
signing if not all parties have approved it. In Page v. Sherrill , the Texas Supreme Court 
voided a temporary custody change that was done ex parte without notice. While our case was not ex parte (Charles was physically present), the lack of formal notice and rushing is analogous to a notice failure. Due process requires notice reasonably calculated to inform the person of the action and an opportunity to respond. Charles's "opportunity" to respond 
was truncated to mere minutes under threat.  
3. Bias and Irregularity  M.2192 M.2192
M.2192 M.2192 M.2192 M.2192

Having opposing counsel write the judge's orders (handwritten on the report) is 
irregular. It creates an appearance that the neutral arbiter (the judge) abdicated decision -
making to one side's lawyer. The result is not a product of a court's reasoned decision or 
mutual consent, but essentially the wish list of one party imposed as an order. Courts 
have inherent authority to sign orders, but they should draft or carefully review them – not just sign whatever one lawyer puts in front of them without the other 's approval. If the 
March 14 report notes were indeed by Carter, the Associate Judge should not have relied 
on those as if they were the AJ's own findings. This informality undermines confidence 
that the order was the result of a fair process.  
 
4. Infringement on Parental Rights without Due Course  
The temporary orders severely restricted Charles's rights (requiring him to leave 
the marital home, giving Mother primary custody, supervising exchanges, etc.). Such significant deprivations, even temporarily, demand scrupulous adherence to procedure. By cutting procedural corners, the court potentially violated Charles's constitutional right 
to due process. The Texas Family Code's requirement of affidavits for excluding a parent 
(Fam. Code §105.001(c)) is one manifestation of due process protection. If those 
requirements were not strictly met or if the evidence was lacking (Charles alleges no evidence was presented on February 1 to justify kicking him out and giving mom full custody), that initial order itself was problematic. Compounding that with an improper finalization process makes it worse. Essentially, Charles and his children were subject to 
a significant custody determination without the full protections of a proper adversarial 
hearing or a proper agreed resolution – a hybrid worst -of-both: no heari ng, and no 
genuine agreement. Such a result is fundamentally unfair. When taken into consideration 
that Charles needed the family home to operate his usual course of business, this makes 
even less sense and raises eyebrows as to how the mother was able to get away with such 
conduct.  
Equity and good conscience would call for such an order to be set aside. Courts 
have the power to vacate interlocutory orders that were improvidently granted or that M.2193 M.2193
M.2193 M.2193 M.2193 M.2193

resulted from procedural irregularity. Here, the temporary orders process was tainted start 
to finish – from the lack of evidence at the outset (if Charles's earlier contentions are 
correct), to the failure to follow the AJ's procedures, to the coercion in  obtaining 
signatures. There is a strong argument that Charles was denied due process, and thus the order is voidable on that independent basis. In some circumstances, a due process violation can render an order void (for example, an order issued without notice or jurisdiction is void). While Charles was present in the case (so jurisdiction over him 
existed), the manner of depriving him of rights without a fair hearing could be deemed 
void as a violation of constitutional due process. This is especially true if we analogize to cases where a court had jurisdiction but acted in a way that violated a party's constitutional rights – courts have not hesitated to grant mandamus or other relief in such 
scenarios because the usual deference to trial court discretion does not extend to ignoring 
fundamental rights.  
E. Are the March 26, 2024 Temporary Orders Facially Void?  
Considering all the above, we assess whether the final Temporary Orders can be 
deemed facially void (void on their face) or at least voidable and subject to being vacated.  
An order is "void" (as opposed to merely voidable) if the court that rendered it 
lacked jurisdiction or authority or if it violates a fundamental jurisdictional requirement. Typically, errors in following procedure make an order voidable (to be corrected on direct appeal or by motion), not outright void. However, Texas law provides that agreed judgments entered without consent are void because the court had "no power to render" 
an agreed judgment absent an actual agreement. In this case, the 322nd District Court had 
subject matter jurisdiction over the divorce/child case and personal jurisdiction over the parties, so jurisdiction in the traditional sense is not at issue. But did the court have authority to render the particular order it rendered? That is que stionable, because the 
court believed it was entering an agreed temporary order – an act that is only authorized 
if all parties truly agreed. Since Charles's consent was not valid, the court's act of signing an agreed order was beyond its lawful authority (it could have held a contested hearing or sent it back to the AJ, but it could not force an agreement). Thus, one could argue the M.2194 M.2194
M.2194 M.2194 M.2194 M.2194

order is void ab initio for lack of the required consent. The face of the order proclaims 
that consent, but the supporting record contradicts it.  
When determining facial voidness, courts normally look at the judgment roll or 
the order itself and related documents. Here, the face of the order contains an internal inconsistency: it says both parties agreed and evidenced by signatures, but one attorney's signature is missing and we know one party's signature was coerced. Admittedly, 
coercion is an extrinsic fact (not evident solely from the document). However, the 
absence of Charles's attorney's approval is evident from the order itself – any reader can  
see one side's attorney did not sign. That is a facial defect in an "agreed" order. One could say the order is void on its face because it recites a non -existent agreement and because it 
was entered in violation of the statute that requires all parties' written agreement for an associate judge to sign a final order. (Although a temporary order doesn't require written agreement of all parties to be signed by an AJ, in this case the order explicitly relies on supposed agreement.) 
Even if a court hesitates to label it "void," it is unquestionably voidable for abuse 
of discretion and should be vacated on a direct attack. The trial court's failure to follow its own procedures and the statutory framework is a clear abuse of discretion.  Few scenarios 
fit the definition of an abuse of discretion more squarely than a judge signing an order 
that one party's attorney never approved and that one party objected to and only signed 
under threat. The integrity of the order is so compromised that it cannot be allowed to stand.  
V . REMEDIES 
A. Vacating the Temporary Orders – Mandamus Relief  
Because these are temporary orders in a family law case, they are not appealable by ordinary means. Texas law is clear that temporary orders in family cases cannot be challenged by interlocutory appeal. See Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001(e) ("Temporary orders rendered under this section are not subject to interlocutory appeal."). Instead, the proper 
vehicle for challenging such orders is a petition for writ of mandamus. Mandamus is an M.2195 M.2195
M.2195 M.2195 M.2195 M.2195

extraordinary remedy that will issue only when (1) the trial court clearly abused its 
discretion and (2) there is no adequate remedy by appeal.  
In this case, both elements for mandamus relief are present:  
1. Clear Abuse of Discretion : As detailed above, the trial court clearly abused its 
discretion by:  
• Failing to follow the Associate Judge's explicit procedures for finalizing the order  
• Entering an "agreed" order without valid consent from both parties  
• Allowing procedural irregularities that violated due process  
• Permitting coercion to obtain a party's signature  
2. No Adequate Remedy by Appeal : Since temporary orders are not appealable, 
Charles has no adequate remedy by appeal. He would have to wait until a final decree is entered to challenge these orders on appeal, by which time the harm from the improper temporary orders would be irreparable . The children's living 
arrangements, Charles's access to them, and other important matters would be 
governed by invalid orders for months or even years while the case proceeds to 
final judgment. 
Texas courts have consistently granted mandamus relief in family law cases where 
temporary orders were entered improperly. For example, in In re Stearns, 202 S.W.3d 414 (Tex. App. –Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, orig. proceeding), the court granted mandamus 
relief where the trial court's temporary orders effectively changed custody without proper notice or evidence. Similarly, in Page v. Sherrill , 415 S.W.2d 642 (Tex. 1967), the Texas 
Supreme Court granted mandamus relief where a temporary custody order was issu ed 
without notice and hearing, violating due process.  
If the order is truly void (as opposed to merely voidable), mandamus relief is even 
more appropriate. As the Texas Supreme Court held in In re Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., M.2196 M.2196
M.2196 M.2196 M.2196 M.2196

35 S.W.3d 602, 605 (Tex. 2000), if an order is void, mandamus relief is available without 
showing inadequate remedy by appeal.  
B. Alternative Remedies  
In addition to mandamus relief, Charles might consider the following alternative 
remedies:  
1. Motion to Vacate or Set Aside : Charles could file a motion in the trial court 
asking the judge to vacate or set aside the temporary orders based on the procedural irregularities and lack of valid consent. While this approach has the 
advantage of giving the trial court an opportunity t o correct its own error, it may 
be less effective if the trial court is unwilling to acknowledge the problems with the order.  
2. Motion for Reconsideration or New Trial : Charles could file a motion for 
reconsideration or new trial on the temporary orders. This would allow him to present evidence of the procedural irregularities and coercion. However, there is no guarantee that the trial court would grant such a motion, a nd the time for filing 
may have already expired.  
3. Motion for Further Temporary Orders: Charles could file a motion for further temporary orders, essentially asking the court to revisit the custody and 
possession arrangements. This would not directly challenge the validity of the 
existing orders but could provide an opportunity to modify them. The disadvantage is that it would not address the underlying procedural problems.  
Of these alternatives, mandamus relief is likely the most appropriate and effective 
remedy given the nature of the procedural irregularities and the fact that temporary orders are not appealable. A petition for writ of mandamus would allow an appellate cou rt to 
review the process by which the temporary orders were obtained and, if appropriate, to 
vacate them and direct the trial court to conduct proper proceedings.  
VI. CONCLUSION  M.2197 M.2197
M.2197 M.2197 M.2197 M.2197

The procedural irregularities surrounding the March 26, 2024 Temporary Orders in Cause 
No. 322- 744263-23 raise serious questions about their validity. The evidence 
demonstrates multiple significant deviations from proper legal procedure, including:  
1. Failure to follow the Associate Judge's explicit instructions regarding who would prepare the order, the timeline for preparation, and the requirement for attorney approval;  
2. Lack of valid consent to support an "agreed" order, as evidenced by Charles's missing signature on the February 1 report, his explicit objection to Paragraph 3 on March 14, the coerced nature of his signature on March 26, and the absence of 
his attorney's approval;  
3. Potential non -conformance between the final written order and what was actually 
ordered or agreed to at the February 1 hearing;  
4. Due process violations, including the denial of a meaningful opportunity to be 
heard on disputed terms, lack of proper notice, irregularities in the process, and significant infringement on parental rights without proper procedural safeguards.  
These procedural failures are not mere technicalities. They strike at the heart of the 
judicial process and the fundamental fairness that must characterize court proceedings. When a court order purports to be based on the agreement of the parties, but one party's 
consent was obtained through coercion or was never actually given, the integrity of the 
judicial system is compromised.  
The March 26, 2024 Temporary Orders are, at minimum, voidable due to the clear 
abuse of discretion in their entry. There is a strong argument that they are void on their face because they recite an agreement that did not exist and because the court lacked authority to enter an agreed order without genuine consent from both parties.  
Given the non-appealable nature of temporary orders in family cases, mandamus 
relief is the appropriate remedy. Charles should consider filing a petition for writ of mandamus asking the appellate court to vacate the temporary orders and direct the trial M.2198 M.2198
M.2198 M.2198 M.2198 M.2198

court to conduct proper proceedings, either by holding a contested hearing on the 
temporary orders or by ensuring that any agreed order truly reflects the voluntary agreement of both parties.  
The procedural history of this case serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of 
adhering to proper legal procedures, especially in family law cases where the rights of parents and the welfare of children are at stake. Courts and attorneys must be v igilant in 
ensuring that agreed orders truly reflect agreement, that parties' due process rights are respected, and that the integrity of the judicial process is maintained.

 ISSUES PRESENTED FOR RECONSIDERATION  
 
Rehearing Issue No. 1: 
The Texas Supreme Court has held that consolidation constitutes an abuse of 
discretion when it prejudices a party or misjudges the relatedness of actions. 
The panel erred by denying mandamus relief and allowing to stand a sua sponte consolidation order that prejudiced Relator by delaying urgent child 
custody proceedings, eliminating strategic advantages, pre -empted appellate 
review, generat ed further procedural confusion.  
  
Rehearing Issue No. 2: 
When the record demonstrates that separate proceedings are necessary to prevent manifest injustice, the trial court has a duty to avoid consolidation. The panel erred by overlooking the manifest injustice resulting from the trial 
court’s sua sponte consolidation, which violated due process by ignoring a 
pending Rule 12 motion and written objection, and introduced further procedural irregularities into already strained litigation.

 TO THE HONORABLE SECOND  COURT OF APPEALS:  
Relator CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS respectfully moves this Honorable 
Court for en banc  reconsideration of the panel decisions rendered in three separate 
but interwoven mandamus proceedings to be presented for reconsideration in the 
following order: 
i. Cause No. 02- 25-00166- CV (denied April 14, 2025)  (“V oid Order”) 
ii. Cause No. 02- 25-00171- CV (denied April 17, 2025)  (“Consolidation”)  
iii. Cause No. 02- 25-00164- CV (denied April 11, 2025)  (“SAPCR/TRO”)  
 
This motion serves as the second filed reconsideration motion  and addresses 
the panel’s denial of Cause No. 02- 25-00171-CV (attached as Tab 1) , referred to as 
the “Consolidation ” mandamus.   
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT  
This motion satisfies the stringent standards for en banc reconsideration 
under Tex. R. App. P. 41.2(c) because the panel’s denial conflicts with controlling 
precedent and overlooks critical facts in the mandamus record. The trial court 
abused its discretion by sua sponte consolidating Relator’s SAPCR with a stalled divorce case on April 11, 2025, without notice, hearing, or consideration of 
Relator’s objection and pending Rule 12 motion. This consolidation prejudiced 
Relator by delaying urgent child custody and support resolutions, eliminating 
strategic advantages, pre -empted appellate review, and  caused further procedural 
confusion, violating Tex. R. Civ. P. 174(a) and Tex. Fam. Code § 153 .002. The M.2208 M.2208
M.2208 M.2208 M.2208 M.2208

 panel’s denial conflicts with Womack v. Berry, 291 S.W.2d 677 (Tex. 1956), Dal -
Briar Corp. v. Baskette , 833 S.W.2d 612 (Tex. App. —El Paso 1992), and Lone Star 
Ford, Inc. v. McCormick , 838 S.W.2d 734 (Tex. App. —Houston [1st Dist.] 1992), 
which emphasize that consolidation must not prejudice a party. En banc review is 
essential to ensure uniformity in family law and protect the children’s best interests.  
ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITY 
I. En banc reconsideration is warranted under Rule 41.2(c) due to extraordinary circumstances and the need for uniformity.  
 En banc reconsideration is appropriate when a panel’s decision conflicts 
with controlling authority or involves an issue of exceptional importance. Tex. R. App. P. 41.2(c); In re Marriage of Harrison , 507 S.W.3d 259, 260 (Tex. App. —
[14th Dist.] April 26, 2016, order) as corrected May 10, 2016 (Frost, J., dissenting 
to partial grant of en banc reconsideration) . This matter me ets both criteria.  
The panel’s per curiam denial on April 17, 2025, conflicts with Texas 
Supreme Court precedent requiring trial courts to exercise discretion within guiding rules and principles. Womack v. Berry , 291 S.W.2d 677, 683 (Tex. 1956) 
(mandamus appropriate to correct clear abuse of discretion in trial management). 
The consolidation delays critical child custody and support determinations, 
undermining Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002, which mandates that “the be st interest of M.2209 M.2209
M.2209 M.2209 M.2209 M.2209

7 
 the child shall always be the primary consideration of the court in determining the 
issues of conservatorship and possession of and access to the child”. Allowing trial 
courts to consolidate cases sua sponte without addressing objections or pending 
motions sets a dangerous precedent in family law, where procedural fairness is 
paramount. En banc review is necessary to maintain uniformity and protect the children’s welfare. 
II. The panel’s denial conflicts with controlling authority and overlooks 
critical facts established in the mandamus record.  
The panel’s denial fails to recognize the trial court’s abuse of discretion and 
the resulting prejudice, as evidenced by the mandamus record and established Texas law.  
A. The trial court abused its discretion by consolidating without sound legal 
basis.  
 
Tex. R. Civ. P. 174(a) permits consolidation only when cases share common 
questions of law or fact and when it does not prejudice any party. The trial court’s 
sua sponte consolidation of Relator’s SAPCR with an unprosecuted divorce case 
lacks a sound legal basis and contravenes this rule. In Dal -Briar Corp. v. Baskette , 
833 S.W.2d 612, 615 (Tex. App. —El Paso 1992, no writ), the court held that 
consolidation constitutes an abuse of discretion if it prejudices a party, such as by 
delaying urgent proceedings or creating procedural confusion. Here, the M.2210 M.2210
M.2210 M.2210 M.2210 M.2210

8 
 consolidation delays time -sensitive child custody and support decisions, directly 
undermining Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002. For example, the SAPCR’s unresolved 
custody issues, critical to the children’s stability, are stalled by the divorce case’s procedural c omplexities, causing ongoing harm to their welfare.  
Furthermore, in Lone Star Ford, Inc. v. McCormick , 838 S.W.2d 734, 737 
(Tex. App. —Houston [1st Dist.] 1992, writ denied), the court affirmed that while 
trial courts have broad discretion to consolidate cases with common issues, such 
discretion is abused if consolidation results in prejudice to a party. In that case, the 
court found no abuse because the appellant failed to demonstrate prejudice, noting, 
“Appellant  failed to demonstrate how it was prejudiced as a result of 
consolidation.” Id. at 738.  In contrast, here, the consolidation has caused 
significant prejudice by delaying urgent child custody and support resolutions, which are time -sensitive and critical to the children’s welfare under Tex. Fam. 
Code § 153.002. This delay distinguishes the present case from Lone Star Ford and 
underscores the trial court’s abuse of discretion, as the issues still remain 
unadjudicated.  
Moreover, Womack v. Berry, 291 S.W.2d at 683, establishes that mandamus 
relief is appropriate when a trial court abuses its discretion to a party’s detriment, 
such as through improper trial management. Although Womack  addressed separate 
trials, its principle applies analogously to consolidation decisions that prejudice a M.2211 M.2211
M.2211 M.2211 M.2211 M.2211

9 
 party. The trial court’s failure to demonstrate common questions justifying 
consolidation, coupled with its disregard for the prejudice caused by delay, 
constitutes a clear abuse of discretion. See also Guar. Fed. Sav. Bank v. Horseshoe 
Operating Co., 793 S.W.2d 652, 658 (Tex. 1990) (trial court discretion in 
consolidation is not unbounded). The panel’s denial overlooks these precedents, allowing an unsupported consolidation to stand.  
B. The sua sponte consolidation resulted in prejudice and violated due 
process.  
The trial court’s consolidation order, issued without notice or hearing, 
violated Relator’s due process rights by ignoring a pending Tex. R. Civ. P. 12 motion challenging the Real Party’s counsel’s authority and Relator’s objection to 
consolidation. (MR 7, MR 9)  In Crestway Care  Center, Inc. v.  Berchelmann , 945 
S.W.2d 872, 873 (Tex. App. —San Antonio 1997, orig. proceeding), the court 
emphasized that significant procedural actions, like consolidation, require clarity 
and proper documentation to ensure fair review. Here, the trial court’s failure to 
provide notice or a hearing —despite Relator’s objection (MR 9.1, MR 12.32) and 
pending Rule 12 motion (MR 7)—created procedural irregularities.  Moreover, 
Tex. R. Civ. P. 12 requires an attorney to demonstrate authority when challenged, 
and the trial court’s failure to resolve this motion risks validating actions by potentially unauthorized counsel, creating a procedural quagmire.  M.2212 M.2212

10 This consolidation a ction p rejudiced Relator i n four critical way s: (1) 
delaying urgent c hild custody and support re solutions that re main unopposed, 
causing further harm t o the c hildren ’s welfare; (2) eliminating strategic a dvantages 
in the SA PCR c ourt; (3) causing procedural c onfusion by merging distinct l egal 
issues; and (4) thwarted R elator ’s attemp t at seeking m andamus r elief. These 
impact s mirror the pre judice i n Dal -Briar Corp. v. Baskette , where c onsolidation 
harme d a party ’s ability to pursue t imely relief. The Real Pa rty’s counsel ’s failure 
to respond t o this appeal furt her underscores the proc edural i rregularities . By 
upholding th e trial court’s o rder, th e panel’s denial conflicts with these a uthorities 
and fails t o address the m anifest i njustice i nflicted on Relator and the af fected 
children. 
These i mpact s mirror t he pre judice i n Dal -Briar Corp. v. Baskette , where 
consolidation harmed a pa rty’s ability to pursue t imely relief, and contrast w ith 
Lone Star F ord, w here no prejudice w as found. The R eal Pa rty’s counsel ’s non-
participation a t the trial court level further unde rscores the proce dural 
irregularities, a s it leaves t he Rule 12 challenge una ddressed. B y upholding the 
trial court’s order, the panel’s denial conflicts with these authorities and fails to 
address the manifest injustice inflicted on the Relator an d the affected children, 
who remain left without an adequate remedy for an appeal .M.2213 M.2213

11 CONCLUSION AND PRAYER  
The trial court’s sua sponte consolidation order of April 11, 2025, is not 
merely erroneous—it is procedurally indefensible. By consolidating Relator’s 
SAPCR with a stalled divorce case without notice, hearing, or resolution of a 
pending Rule 12 motion and objection, the court flouted due process and Texas 
Family Code § 153.002’s mandate to prioritize children’s best interests. The pending Rule 12 motion challenged the Real Party’s counsel’s authority, yet the 
court  and Real Party  proceeded as if no question existed, risking the validity of 
every subsequent action. This illogic is akin to building a house on a contested 
foundation, inviting collapse.   
Relator prays that this Court grant en banc  reconsideration, withdraw or 
otherwise vacate the panel’s denial, and issue mandamus relief compelling the 
Respondent to vacate the consolidation orde r. Such relief will restore procedural 
fairness, protect constitutional rights, and ensure the children’s best interests are not sacrificed to judicial expediency .

Current issues 
 Currently, there are several issues that remain unaddressed that need to be resolved:  
1. The entire case foundation is fraudulent due to Petitioner’s pleadings. 
2. The undersigned has sought relief from this situation since March 14, 2024, 
when the original orders issued on January 16, 2024, which removed the 
undersigned from his home without the required findings, were leveraged into 
a settlement agreement that was not consented to by all of the parties and did not serve the best interests of the children.  
3. COOPER L. CARTER’s authority remains in question, and her inactivity combined with the ambiguity surrounding her representation must be addressed . 
4. The undersigned has been forced to live in transient housing and incur extraordinary damages to his business operations due to the Petitioners fraudulent allegations which were never supported by evidence. 
5. The children in this matter continue to suffer ongoing and irreparable harm from being separated from their father unjustifiably . 
6. There is no child support set up for the children. 
Informal service  
 Furthermore, the court continues to issue notices informally through the court coordinator, which is improper. 
Pursuant to Texas Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 21a, service of a notice via email 
directly, rather than through the electronic filing manager (EFM), does not constitute proper M.2220 M.2220
M.2220 M.2220 M.2220 M.2220

service if the email address is on file with the EFM. Texas courts have consistently held that 
electronic service must be made through the EFM when the recipient's email address is registered there.  The undersigned’s email is registered with the EFM.  
Conclusion 
 Because the undersigned has an email on file with the EFM, there is no court order 
requiring alternative service, and there is no agreement waiving formal service, any notice of court proceedings not in compliance with rule 21a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure is improper.  
 Furthermore, because there are several issues that remain unaddressed, such as COOPER 
CARTER’S authority, the ongoing mandamus proceedings, the ongoing irreparable harm to the 
children , and the facially void orders which have caused detrimental effects to the undersigned, 
the risk of these issues creating future delays remains high.  
 The undersigned is prepared to challenge any adverse actions taken against him in the 
face of these issues and will seek relief until this matter is resolved in accordance with the principles of fairness and justice.  The undersigned requests that the court stay all fu ture 
proceedings until the above matters are resolved.

13 ARGUMENT  
A. Mandamus Standard
Mandamus relief is warranted when the trial court clearly abused its 
discretion,  and the Relator (“Mr. Myers”), h as no adequate appellate remedy. In re 
Coppola, 535 S.W.3d 506, 508 (Tex. 2017) (orig. proceeding) (per curiam). “A 
trial court clearly abuses its discretion if ‘it reaches a decision so arbitrary and 
unreasonable as to amount to a clear and prejudicial error of law' [or if it clearly 
fails] to analyze or apply the law correctly ․” Walker v. Packer,  827 S.W.2d 833, 
839–4 0 (Tex. 2006) (orig. proceeding) (quoting Johnson v . Fourth Court of 
Appeals, 700 S.W.2d 916, 917 (Tex. 1985), disapproved of on other grounds by In 
re Columbia Med. Ctr. of Las Colinas, Subsidiary, L.P., 290 S.W.3d 204 (Tex. 
2009)). In any event, as shown in the next section, appeal is no remedy at all under 
these urgent circumstances. 
B. Consolidation and EX -Part e Procedure
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 174(a) permits consolidation of actions that 
involve common questions of law or fact. (APP 6.1) See also Lone Star Ford, Inc.  v. 
McCormick , 838 S. W.2d 734, 7 37 (Tex. App. -Houston [1st D ist.] 1992, w rit 
denied) . A trial c ourt c annot a rbitrarily consolidate ca ses in a manner that 
prejudices one of the pa rties. E ven whe n consolidation is pe rmissible i n principle, 
the c ourt m ust ba lance j udicial c onvenience against any risk of unfa ir prejudice or M.2236 M.2236

14 confusio n, and it m ust re spect t he pa rties’ right t o be he ard on the i ssue. Crestway 
Care Ct r., Inc. v. B erchelmann , 945 S. W.2d 872, 87 4 (Tex. App. —San Antonio 
1997, or ig. proc eeding) (en banc). Consolidation decisions are re viewe d for abuse 
of discretion, a nd “a trial court m ay abuse i ts discretion by … c onsolidating cases 
when the consolidation results in prejudice t o the complaining part y.” (citing Lone 
Star F ord, 838 S. W.2d at 738)  
In other words, w hen deciding w hether to consolidate, t he trial c ourt m ust 
balance t he judicial economy a nd co nvenience that may be gained by the 
consolidation against t he risk of a n unfair outcome be cause of prejudice . See Dal -
Briar, 833 S. W.2d at 615. Even i f the cases share c ommon questions o f law and 
fact, an abuse of discretion may be found if the c onsolidation results i n 
prejudice t o the complaining part y. Lone Star Ford, Inc ., 838 S. W.2d at 738. 
Here, t hat is precisely what occurre d. Mr. Myers has t hree concurrent 
mandamuses now before this court, and cause number 02-2 5-00164-C V, (“the 
TRO/SAPCR mandamus”) sought emergency relief in March 2025. (MR 8.2) The 
court’s procedural handling of his Application for Temporary Restraining Order 
(TRO) was highly irregular and violated the letter and spirit of Texas procedural 
rules.  
Texa s Rule of Civil Procedure 680 provides that no TRO sha ll be gra nted 
without notice to the adverse p arty u nless specific facts show im mediate M.2237 M.2237
M.2237 M.2237 M.2237 M.2237

15 irreparable injury will occur before notice can be given. Even when an ex parte 
TRO is justified, TRCP 680 requires the order to be narrowly time -limited (14 
days) and promptly set for hearing on a temporary injunction.  (APP 7)  Here, Mr. 
Myers  followed the rules by giving notice to the opposing party and coordinating 
with the Court for a presentation of his TRO.  (MR 12.1-12.9) Tarrant County Local 
Rule 4.01(11)(e) (l ikewise requires a party seeking ex parte  relief to certify to the 
Court the efforts made to notify the opposing side or explain why notice should not 
be given. Mr. Myers never received a response from the opposing side.  
Notably, on March 27, 2025, the Court (through its coordinator) insisted that 
Mr. Myers  appear in person to present the TRO and inform opposing counsel of the 
scheduled time. The coordinator wrote:  
“This order needs to be presented in person. Likewise, you need to inform opposing 
counsel of the date and time you intend to present this order to the court.” (MR 12.9) 
Mr. Myers  promptly complied. He emailed Ms. Allison on March 27 
confirming that he had informed the opposing counsel of the intended presentation 
at 9:00 a.m. the following day and that he would update both the Court and opposing party if anything changed. 
(MR 12.9) 
After receiving no response from either the opposing counsel or real party in 
interest, Mr. Myers served the documents he intended to present to the court.  (MR 
12.19) Rather than corresponding with Mr. Myers directly, the opposing counsel 
contacted the court coordinator, where she stated via email:  M.2238 M.2238
M.2238 M.2238 M.2238 M.2238

16  “I have received communication from opposing party who is pro se that he will be 
walking through an Emergency TRO. Our office has a hearing scheduled for tomorrow morning 
in Parker County and is unable to attend. However, I will be available by cell phone regarding 
this matter if the Judge would like to speak to me regarding the Emergency TRO. Please 
contact our office to patch me in for any calls that Judge would like to have.” (MR 12.20) 
and most critically, the opposing  counsel went on to say: 
“Additionally, this case already is pending in the 322nd for a divorce proceeding 
regarding property and children matters. We will be consolidating the case and walking it 
through the 322nd for signature next week.” (MR 12.20) 
The following morning, Mr. Myers made an appearance, as confirmed by the 
coordinator.  
“Mr. Myers appeared before me to schedule the hearing for the TRO; my apologies I did 
not realize this was that same case.   We can go ahead and set the TRO with us, but most 
likely the case will be transferred prior to the hearing date and the case needs to be 
transferred prior to that date.  Mr. Myers will be emailing with dates available for the 
hearing.” (MR 12.24) 
This was followed by the following email: 
“Additionally, since there is an objection to the consolidation, y’all will need to reach out 
to request how to proceed 
with the 322nd as I am usure of their procedures.” (MR 12.25) 
Mr. Myers then promptly provided dates at 9:59 a.m. on March 28, 2025, (MR  
12.26) the hearing was agreed to be set for April 10, 2025.  (MR 12.29) Despite  
following the correct procedure, Mr. Myers was not permitted to present his  
emergency TRO, and was denied the opportunity to be heard outright because of 
the c onsolidation motion that would be filed the fol lowing week. (MR 12.20)  
In short, Mr. Myers , acting pro se , did exactly what the rules required and 
what the Court directed: he gave notice and appeared in person as instructed.  The M.2239 M.2239
M.2239 M.2239 M.2239 M.2239

17 threshol d matters should have c ame second to the be st interests of the c hildren. Se e 
Tex. Fam . Code 153. 002. (APP 5) 
That statement – “ I did n ot realize this w as that same case ” (MR 12.24)  – is a 
stunning acknowledgment of a procedural l apse. It i ndicates that t he Court fa iled to 
connect t he dot s that Mr. Myers’ new ca se concerning the c hild w as related to the 
ongoing divorce ca se. As a r esult, i nstea d of promptly hearing Mr. Myers TRO on 
its m erits, the C ourt stalled a nd im mediately c ontemplated m oving th e case a way, 
leaving M r. Myers’ emergenc y request i n limbo. The only individuals w ho 
followed proper procedure he re were t he undersigned and the court c oordinator, 
non-licensed in dividuals. (MR 12.24)  
In summary, the procedure leading up to Respondent’s abuse of discretion 
was an abuse of discretion itself, warranting the “TRO/SAPCR Mandamus” that 
was denied per curiam without any substance.  (APP 4) 
It was made ve ry clear by the 233rd court t hat the consolidation motion filed 
by the opp osing party on Ma rch 20, 2025 , was filed in the i ncorrect c ourt. (MR 5) 
(MR 12.17) This w as used a gainst M r. Myers at the 1 1th hour to prevent t he TRO 
hearing, a s show n above. The forward- looking consolidati on motion that w as used 
to justify d enying M r. Myers hi s day in court w as filed by RODERICK D. MARX, 
a non- party in either the SA PCR sui t or the di vorce m atter on April 3 , 2025. (MR 
13.5) see also (M R 7.18) M.2240 M.2240
M.2240 M.2240 M.2240 M.2240

18 Shortly thereafter, the opposing counsel emailed Mr. Myers stating:  
“This is to inform you that I will be walking through the attached Motion for 
Consolidation and Proposed Order tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m. in the 322nd for 
signature. ” (MR 12.31)  
Mr. Myers promptly replied, stating:  
“I've already objected.  
You have no legal authority to do so until you address my objection filed and 
served to you. ” (MR 12.32)  
This procedural gamesmanship is the exact reason why the undersigned opened a 
new SAPCR, as it has left the divorce to languish outside of one -sided attempts to 
pursue relief, a s clearly  pointed out in his pleadings. There has been no meaningful 
discussion on the merits of this matter with the opposing side  and no attempt to 
prosecute outside of the latest stunt to block emergency relief. (MR 1.1) From 
there, Mr. Myers filed a NOTICE OF INTENT TO SEEK MANDAMUS RELIEF in the 233
rd (MR 14) and began preparing his first mandamus brief, which was 
submitted to this court on April 10, 2024.  
I. The Respondent clearly abused his discretion he sua sponte granted RealParty’s contested consolidation motion without notice and hearing to the 
parties.  M.2241 M.2241
M.2241 M.2241 M.2241 M.2241

19 C. ABUSE OF DISCRETION
Immediately after submitting his first mandamus petition, Mr. Myers was 
served with an ORDER GRANTING CONSOLIDATION. (MR 15)  This motion, 
which was used as a barrier to relief, was granted sua sponte by the same court 
who just declined to hear an emergency TRO  before it . 
The record leaves no doubt that Respondent’s decision to consolidate the 
cases without notice or a hearing was a gross departure from the fair administration 
of justice . It is difficult to imagine a more textbook abuse of discretion: a contested  
motion was granted sua sponte , with no opportunity for the opposing party to be 
heard. This is not a close call or a minor procedural wrinkle. The facts speak for themselves – equity, due process, and basic procedural fairness were all denied in 
one fell swoop.  The only question is whether they will continue to be ignored.  
Texas courts have held that a trial court clearly abuses its discretion by 
granting a contested motion sua sponte without providing notice or a hearing. In 
D.A. Buckner Constr., Inc. v. Hobson, for example, the trial judge entered an order
(imposing sanctions) even though the affected party had no notice or opportunity to 
be heard. The court of appeals declared that order void  and emphatically stated: 
“Respondent’s order was without notice or hearing. Under these circumstances, the 
trial court’s order is void, and mandamus will lie to vacate such an order.”  Such is 
the case here. Therefore, the law should apply equally.  M.2242 M.2242
M.2242 M.2242 M.2242 M.2242

20 
 D. NO ADEQUATE REMEDY  
In determining whether an appeal is an adequate remedy,  courts have 
weighed the benefits over the detriments. In re BP Prods. N. Am., Inc ., 244 S.W.3d 
840, 845 (Tex.2008) (orig.proceeding).  A party establishes that no adequate 
appellate remedy exists by showing it is in real danger of losing its substantial 
rights. Perry v. Del Rio , 66 S.W.3d 239, 257 (Tex.2001) (orig.proceeding). As 
repeatedly stated throughout these proceedings, Relator has been deprived of the 
most fundamental rights one can have: the right to possess and protect his home, 
and the right to care for, maintain contact with, and make decisions regarding his minor children. These rights are not abstract — they are protected by the U.S. 
Constitution, the Texas Constitution, and longstanding precedent . 
E. ONGOING AND IRREPARABLE HARM  
The Texas Supreme Court has repeatedly reaffirmed that “a parent’s rights to 
the care, custody, and control of their children are constitutional in nature and must be afforded heightened protection.” In re C.J.C. , 603 S.W.3d 804, 809 (Tex. 2020).  
Likewise, property rights — including the right to remain in and possess one’s 
home — are protected under Article I, Section 19 of the Texas Constitution and the 
Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  See also  University of Tex. Med. 
Branch v. Than, 901 S.W.2d 926, 930 (Tex. 1995) M.2243 M.2243
M.2243 M.2243 M.2243 M.2243

21 When such rights are denied without valid order, hearing, or opportunity to 
be heard — as occurred here — the violation is not merely procedural: it is a 
constitutional injury , and one that warrants immediate mandamus relief . For all 
reasons incorporated herein, Mandamus should be issued , as deprivation is 
ongoing, and will occur until justice is rightfully served.  
Relator has clearly established the Respondent’s consolidation was both 
procedurally improper, and prejudicial. For all reasons incorporated herein, the  
court should uphold Texas precedent, and issue mandamus relief to restore justice 
to these proceedings.  
CONCLUSION  
With a prima facie showing of systemic abuse laid bare across the trilogy of 
mandamus petitions now before this Court, it is no longer credible to characterize 
the lower court’s conduct as isolated error. Two of the three heads of this 
procedural dragon—embodied by the 233rd, the 322nd, and this very Court—have 
already rendered per curiam denials, offering no explanation in the face of 
documented, unrebutted misconduct. The record in each petition stands 
unopposed. No adversary response has been filed. No evidentiary challenge has 
been made. The silence against Relator’s claims is not merely strategic—it is 
telling. A dangerous precedent is being forged in silence. This court must act.M.2244 M.2244

the 233rd District Court, to vacate the April 2025 consolidation order, as itwas entered sua sponte  on a contested  motion;
2.Take judicial notice of the procedural irregularities and record- supported
adversity faced by Relator throughout these proceedings, including the
refusal to hear his emergency TRO while simultaneously granting relief to
the opposing party;
3.Grant all other relief to which Relator may be justly entitled, at law or inequity, in light of the extraordinary circumstances and ongoing deprivationof due process.
Relator has before this Court three petitions for writ of mandamus. Two have
already been denied per curiam without explanation —perhaps the result of routine 
disregard for pro se filings. But on rehearing, this Court is urged to evaluate this 
petition in c onjunction with its sister mandamuses to fully grasp the depth of 
systemic abuse, procedural evasion, and judicial inconsistency present in the courts 
below.  M.2245 M.2245
M.2245 M.2245 M.2245 M.2245

23 Individually, each mandamus reveals a failure of 
process. Together, they form a “Dragon in Triplicate” — 
a coordinated denial of justice across courts that were 
sworn to protect it.

Fort Worth, Texas 76196  
Re: Original Petition in Suit Affecting Parent -Child Relationship (“SAPCR”) – Request to 
File as Separate Case and Set Immediate Hearing (In the Interest of [M.M.] and [C.M.], 
minor children; related to  Cause No. 322-744263- 23, In re Marriage of Myers)  
Dear Mr. Wilder and Honorable Court: 
Please accept for filing the enclosed Original SAPCR  concerning the above- referenced 
children. This SAPCR is intentionally filed as a new, separate case , rather than under the 
existing divorce cause, due to unique procedural defects in that divorce proceeding that have left 
the children in legal and physical limbo. Immediate intervention  is required to protect the 
children’s best interests. Below, I outline the compelling reasons – supported by law and the record – why this SAPCR must proceed separately  and be set for an emergency hearing  at 
once, instead of being merged into the stalled divorce case. 
A. Failure of Opposing Party to Prosecute
1. The divorce Petitioner has wholly failed to prosecute the divorce, leaving it in
procedural limbo.  Over a year has passed with no meaningful activity toward a final resolution. 
Notably, after the divorce case was removed to federal court and later remanded, Petitioner 
never filed the required certified Order of Remand or gave notice of remand  as mandated by 
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 237a. Rule 237a obligates the removing party to promptly file the 
federal remand order with the state clerk and notify all parties, after which any defendant has 15 
days to answer . Petitioner’s omission  of this required step has left the state court record 
incomplete and the case procedurally suspended. Indeed, due to Petitioner’s inaction (and her 322-744263-23 FILED
TARRANT COUNTY
4/15/2025 10:28 AM
THOMAS A. WILDER
DISTRICT CLERKM.2260 M.2260
M.2260 M.2260 M.2260 M.2260

counsel’s apparent inability to e-file; see Point 8 below), no remand notice was ever filed , so 
the divorce court has not resumed jurisdiction in any practical sense. 
2. In addition, Petitioner has ignored the Texas Supreme Court’s time standards  for
timely disposition of cases . A divorce case is expected to be resolved within 12 months, yet 
Petitioner has made no effort to advance it. She has not set a trial or even a status conference; she 
has allowed critical deadlines to lapse. This lack of diligence violates the duty to prosecute one’s claims and warrants dismissal for want of prosecution. In fact, Respondent has been forced to file a Motion to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution (pending before the Court) detailing Petitioner’s complete failure to move the case forward. This also remains un-responded to. 
Petitioner’s inaction has left the family with no active forum  to address urgent child- related 
issues. Therefore, a separate SAPCR  is necessary to provide a functioning vehicle for relief. 
The children cannot wait  for the Petitioner’s  indifference or strategic delay to abate.  
B. Failure to Oppose Any Relief (Legal Concession)
3. Throughout the divorce case, Petitioner has not opposed or responded to any of
Respondent’s filings , motions, or claims for relief. She and her counsel have remained silent in 
the face of serious allegations and requests, effectively conceding the merits  of those issues 
under Texas law. Respondent has raised grave claims of fraud, perjury, deception, and child neglect  against Petitioner in his pleadings, yet Petitioner’s counsel has filed no response or 
defense to these claims . Respondent also served discovery and Requests for Admissions which 
went completely unanswered , resulting in deemed admissions. He even filed a motion to 
compel discovery, which Petitioner again did not oppose , though unfortunately no hearing has 
yet been held . Moreover, when Respondent moved for other interim relief (including return to 
the family home and expanded access to the children), Petitioner filed no opposition. By her M.2261 M.2261
M.2261 M.2261 M.2261 M.2261

inaction, Petitioner has implicitly admitted the validity  of Respondent’s factual assertions and 
the justness of his requests.  
4.Texas law is clear that a party who fails to respond to motions or claims effectively
waives any objection and accepts the movant’s evidence as true . For example, in the 
summary judgment context, if a nonmovant files no response, the court may accept the movant’s 
asserted facts as uncontroverted and render judgment if entitlement is shown; issues not timely raised in a written response are waived; see Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c) . The same principle applies 
here: Petitioner’s total failure to contest Respondent’s filings is tantamount to a legal concession  
of those matters . In other words, f ailure to make timely and specific objections results in waiver 
of the objections. S ee Clark v. Trailways, Inc., 774 S.W.2d 644, 647 (Tex. 1989), cert. denied, 
493 U.S. 1074, 110 S.Ct. 1122, 107 L.Ed.2d 1028 (1990); Hartford Accident and Indem. Co. v. McCardell , 369 S.W.2d 331, 335 (Tex. 1963); Srite v. Owens-Illinois, Inc., 870 S.W.2d 556, 565 
(Tex.App. — Houston [1st Dist.] 1993), revise d on other grounds, 897 S.W.2d 765). Courts have 
recognized that a party’s failure to respond indicates a belief that the motion has merit.  
5. Petitioner’s silence speaks volumes. She has never disputed that Respondent should be
allowed to return home or see his children – in fact, she has not opposed any relief requested. This silence should be treated as acquiescence. Accordingly, there is no reason to keep the children waiting in the paralytic divorce case when no one is even arguing against  the relief 
Respondent seeks in this SAPCR. The SAPCR can and should proceed on the uncontroverted facts in Respondent’s filings. 
C.Best Interests of the Children Demand Immediate ActionM.2262 M.2262
M.2262 M.2262 M.2262 M.2262

6. Every day that passes with the children separated from their father is a day of
irreparable harm.  The undisputed evidence is that the children are suffering due to 
Respondent’s forced absence from the home. In the months since he was excluded, the children’s 
well-being has precipitously declined: they have fallen behind in school, missed critical medi cal 
and dental appointments, and have been emotionally traumatized by the sudden and prolonged separation from their father. No party—not even Petitioner—has asserted that the children would be anything but better off if their father could return to care for them. No one has argued against Respondent’s return to the home or his involvement in the children’s daily life. It is axiomatic that the best interest of the children is the paramount concern in any case affecting the parent -
child relationship. See Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002 (mandating that “[t]he best interest of the 
child shall always be the primary consideration of the court in determining the issues of conservatorship and possession of and access to the child”) ; Lenz v. Lenz , 79 S.W.3d 10, 14 
(Tex. 2002) (emphasizing that courts must place “predominant emphasis” on what best serves the children's welfare, particularly focusing on stability, emotional and educational needs, and maintaining frequent contact with fit parents).  
7.The Texas Legislature explicitly prioritized children’s best interests in all
conservatorship and possession determinations: “The best interest of the child shall always be the primary consideration of the court in determining the issues of conservatorship and possession of and access to the child.” Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002. Texas Supreme Court 
jurisprudence confirms and expands upon this legislative directive, instructing courts to consider stability, educational continuity, emotional health, and ongoing relationships with fit parents in their best -interest analysis. See Lenz , 79 S.W.3d at 14–15 (holding courts must evaluate what M.2263 M.2263
M.2263 M.2263 M.2263 M.2263

will best serve the child’s overall welfare, ensuring a stable and emotionally supportive 
environment and maintaining meaningful and frequent parental contact).  
8. Here, it is unquestionably in the children's best interests to have their loving father
back in their daily lives without further delay. Texas public policy explicitly states that children should have frequent and continuing contact with parents who have demonstrated the ability to act in their best interest. See Tex. Fam. Code § 153.001(a)  (declaring the public policy of 
Texas to ensure frequent contact and shared duties between parents and children following separation); Lenz , 79 S.W.3d at 14–15 (affirming that Texas policy favors maintaining 
frequent and meaningful parental involvement in a child's life).  
9. Respondent has demonstrated throughout these proceedings that he is a caring, fit
parent whose presence provides the children with stability, support for their education and health, and emotional security. By contrast, the children’s current situation—living apart from Respondent for no substantiated reason—is destabilizing and harmful. Texas courts recognize the urgency of child custody matters and have repeatedly underscored that “justice demands a speedy resolution of child custody and child support issues.”  In re Tex. Dep’t of Fam. & 
Protective Servs. , 210 S.W.3d 609, 613 (Tex. 2006) (orig. proceeding) (quoting Proffer v. 
Yates , 734 S.W.2d 673, 674 (Tex. 1987)). Simply put, the children’s needs cannot wait on 
procedural formalities or a dormant divorce case. Their welfare requires this SAPCR to be heard immediately so that orders can be promptly put in place to reunite them with their father and address their academic, emotional, and medical needs. No statute or rule forbids initiating a separate SAPCR when it is necessary to protect children's best interests. Indeed, Tex. Fam. Code 
§ 153.002 and the overarching equitable duty of the Court compel swift action here. Respondentis ready, willing, and able to resume caring for his children, and no party has objected to him M.2264 M.2264
M.2264 M.2264 M.2264 M.2264

doing so. Therefore, the Court must accept this SAPCR and schedule an immediate hearing to 
serve the children's best interests without further delay. See Lenz, 79 S.W.3d at 14–15 (holding courts must prioritize swift judicial actions in custody matters, protecting the best interests of children). 
D. Fraud and Perjury Render the Prior Orders Void
10. The orders entered in the divorce case that currently keep Respondent out of the home
and away from the children were obtained through fraud, misrepresentation, and even 
perjury . Because those orders were procured by wrongful means, they are void ab initio  and 
cannot be permitted to stand in the way of this SAPCR. Texas law does not tolerate court orders obtained by trickery or false pretenses. Notably, the temporary orders in the divorce (signed January 16, 2024 and later on March 14, 2024) were presented to the Court as “agreed” orders, yet Respondent never agreed to them  and never signed them. In fact, Respondent had 
expressly opposed the relief in those orders. The “agreement” was a fiction created by Petitioner’s counsel. The record reflects that Petitioner’s counsel drafted and submitted those orders without Respondent’s consent or signature , and which reference a hearing not found on 
the docket. This is a textbook example of a fraud on the court . A judgment or order entered as 
“agreed” when one party actually objected is void. The Texas Supreme Court’s holding in Burnaman v. Heaton is directly on point: when a trial court knows a party does not consent to a purported agreed judgment, it must refuse to sign it; any judgment rendered under such circumstances “is void .” Burnaman v. Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 (Tex. 1951). 
11.Here, the court was misled – it was never disclosed that Respondent vehemently
disagreed. Without such consent the judgment is void. The law will not give effect to a “party’s consent” that was never actually given. Moreover, the way  those orders were obtained M.2265 M.2265
M.2265 M.2265 M.2265 M.2265

was rife with material falsehoods. In her filings, Petitioner knowingly made false statements  to 
the Court to justify excluding Respondent from the home. For example, in her Application for 
Protective Order and supporting affidavit, Petitioner grossly misrepresented the facts, painting Respondent as a danger without evidence. She alleged incidents that never occurred or twisted mundane events into false claims of “family violence.” These misrepresentations were later exposed, and Petitioner has never attempted to prove them in any evidentiary hearing. Petitioner’s intent was plainly to deceive the Court into granting her sole occupancy of the home and custody of the children. Indeed, Respondent’s pending Motion to Dismiss details how Petitioner “knowingly made and presented fraudulent claims to the Court regarding Respondent’s property, with the intent to deprive him of his interest in his home” , and how 
she acted with intent that “these false claims be given the same legal effect as valid court orders, misleading the Court and causing Respondent to be wrongfully deprived of his home and livelihood.”  
12. These strong findings, which stand uncontroverted, show that the prior orders were
procured by fraud and deception. Under longstanding Texas precedent, any order obtained by 
extrinsic fraud  (fraud that effectively prevents a fair presentation of the case) is void and a 
nullity . See King Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman, 118 S.W.3d 742, 751–52 (Tex. 2003) (judgment 
obtained by fraud can be set aside; only extrinsic fraud – such as keeping a party away from court or concealing critical facts – justifies relief) .  
13.Here, Petitioner’s fraud was extrinsic in that it kept Respondent from participating
fully  (the “agreed” order ploy) and kept the Court from learning the true facts . A litigant who 
lies to gain advantage in a court order subverts the process ; the resulting order lacks integrity 
and is void. M.2266 M.2266
M.2266 M.2266 M.2266 M.2266

14. In sum, the prior temporary orders that ousted Respondent were built on a
foundation of fraud . They should carry no weight and pose no obstacle to granting relief in this 
new SAPCR. This Court not only has the authority to declare such orders void, it has a duty to 
do so in order to prevent manifest injusticec . See Burnaman, 240 S.W.2d at 291. By proceeding 
with a fresh SAPCR, the Court can consider the issues regarding the children de novo, on truthful evidence, untainted by the false premises of the earlier orders. Equity regards as done that which ought to have been done – the Court should restore Respondent , CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, 
(Petitioner in the new cause) to his rightful place in the home and children’s lives, as if the fraudulent orders had never been entered. 
E. Restoring the True Status Quo of the Family
15.Relief in this SAPCR is also warranted to restore the status quo  that existed before
Petitioner’s improper actions. The “last actual, peaceable status quo” in this family was 
Respondent living in the home with the children, as a present and active father. That was the reality until late 2023, when Petitioner – through unilateral false allegations – removed Respondent from the household. Texas law holds that the purpose of temporary orders and injunctive relief is to maintain or restore the status quo pending trial. See In re Shifflet, 462 S.W.3d 528, 537 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2015, orig. proceeding) (courts aim to restore the last peaceable status quo pending final trial). 
16.Here, the true status quo ante  was the intact family unit with Respondent present.
The situation now – Respondent barred from the home and children – is a drastic deviation from that status quo, achieved only by contested court orders that, as shown, lack validity. Every day that Respo ndent is kept out is a day the family’s natural equilibrium is disturbed further. M.2267 M.2267

Texas courts have intervened in analogous situations to return to the rightful status quo. For 
example, when one party’s unilateral conduct disrupts a long-standing living arrangement, courts recognize that stability must be restored for the benefit of all, especially the children. See Smith v. McDaniel , 842 S.W.2d 7, 12 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1992, no writ) (courts should preserve or
restore the conditions that existed prior to the controversy to protect the children’s routine and sense of security). Here, restoring the status quo means allowing Respondent back into his home and parenting role immediately . That was the “last peaceable” situation  before litigation 
– a state in which the children were thriving. Notably, the findings in the temporary ordershearing (held without Respondent) even indicate there were no findings of any imminent harm if Respondent were present; the exclusion was based solely on Petitioner’s requested relief, not on proven misconduct by Respondent.  
17. Thus, there is no safety-based reason to maintain the current deviation from the norm.
By contrast, there are powerful reasons to return to normalcy: the children’s suffering would be alleviated, and the family’s balance and stability would be reestablished. 
18. In short, equity demands that we “undo”  the improper disruption caused by
Petitioner’s actions. This SAPCR allows the Court to do exactly that – to realign temporary orders with reality and justice. In re Shifflet instructs that the last peaceable status quo should be restored pending trial . The last peaceable status was Respondent in the home; restoring that 
will harm no one (again, even Petitioner did not claim any abuse or violence requiring exclusion – her application acknowledged no recent violence, only vague fears). Maintaining the currentsituation, by contrast, gravely harms the children and prejudices Respondent’s relationship with them. Therefore, the Court should use the SAPCR proceeding to immediately reinstate Respondent to the home and his parenting time, thereby restoring the status quo  that truly M.2268 M.2268
M.2268 M.2268 M.2268 M.2268

serves the children’s welfare. Every additional day away from that status quo is a deviation that 
this Court can and should correct now. 
F. The Court’s Duty to Act Without Delay for the Children’s Welfare
19.By accepting this SAPCR as a separate case, the Court can fulfill its paramount duty
to protect the children’s welfare without procedural delay . Courts have a sacred obligation  
to put the interests of children above rigid procedural considerations, especially in emergencies. 
The Texas Supreme Court has emphasized that trial courts must act immediately when children’s physical or emotional well- being is at stake , even if procedural complexities exist. 
In In re Tex. Department of Family & Protective Services , for example, the Supreme Court 
admonished that delays in custody matters are intolerable, quoting with approval the maxim: “Justice demands a speedy resolution of child custody and child support issues.”  210 S.W.3d 
609, 613 (Tex. 2006). The high court in that case (a mandamus proceeding) required prompt action despite procedural entanglements, recognizing that a child’s need for a stable, safe environment cannot be made to wait on protracted litigation maneuvers. 
20.Similarly, in Elizondo v. Monteleone , an appellate court noted that when a parent
attempted procedural gambits to delay a custody determination, the court system should not allow those tactics to trump the child’s immediate needs. Elizondo v. Monteleone , 96 S.W.3d 705, 
708 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2002, no pet.) (courts will not permit jurisdictional technicalities to delay emergency relief in a parent -child case). [( If citation is verified)] In that case, one party 
tried to remove the case to federal court and argued that the state court lacked jurisdiction to issue temporary orders during the interim. The court flatly rejected that ploy, holding that the state court must  act to protect the child and could later sort out jurisdiction, because the child’s M.2269 M.2269
M.2269 M.2269 M.2269 M.2269

welfare was paramount. The lesson is clear: procedural fencing cannot override the need for 
immediate judicial action when children are suffering.  
21.Here, Petitioner’s inaction and the snares of the divorce case have already delayed
relief for far too long. The children have been without their father for several critical months of their development . The Court has the power —and indeed the duty —to cut through the 
procedural morass  by creating a new SAPCR docket and promptly addressing the merits of 
conservatorship, possession, and access. There is no jurisdictional barrier to doing so: this Court has continuing jurisdiction over the children (by virtue of the ongoing divorce) and thus can hear a SAPCR involving them. Any concern about duplicitous litigation is mitigated by the fact that 
the divorce case is effectively moribund; furthermore, Respondent will move to consolidate or 
dismiss the divorce once the SAPCR is in place, if appropriate. What cannot be allowed is more delay that leaves the children in a fractured situation. Our Courts are courts of equity as well as law, especially in family matters. When equity demands immediate intervention, the Court should not hesitate. As the Austin Court of Appeals observed, “when the jurisdiction of the court has been properly invoked in matters affecting minor children, the court’ s primary consideration is the best interest of the children, and the court may enter any order deemed necessary to protect and conserve the welfare of the child.”  Elizondo, 96 S.W.3d at 708 (citing Tex. Fam. 
Code § 105.001 on temporary orders for a child). In other words, once the Court is aware of a child in need, it must act, and act swiftly .  
22. That is precisely the situation here. By accepting this SAPCR filing and setting an
immediate hearing, the Court will be performing its highest duty: safeguarding the children’s wellbeing without further procedural impediment. Conversely, to refuse the SAPCR or to delay M.2270 M.2270
M.2270 M.2270 M.2270 M.2270

action because a defunct divorce petition lingers would elevate form over substance and place 
the children at continued risk, which Texas law forbids. 
23. In sum, this Court is empowered and required to provide a forum for immediate
relief , and the SAPCR is the proper mechanism to do so. The Court should therefore promptly 
docket this SAPCR as a new case and schedule an emergency hearing on temporary orders for the children. 
G. Protective- Order Application Confirms Respondent’s Joint Ownership of the Home
24. Even Petitioner’s own filings acknowledge Respondent’s legal right to return to the
residence. In her sworn Application for Protective Order (filed in September 2023), Petitioner 
explicitly affirmed that the marital residence “ is jointly owned or leased by the Applicant and 
Respondent .” 
25.This judicial admission is significant. It means that at the time she sought exclusive
use of the home, Petitioner conceded that Respondent is co -owner (or co -leaseholder) of the 
property. There is no dispute, therefore, that Respondent has an equal property interest and legal right to occupy the home . Petitioner cannot now contradict her own sworn statement by 
suggesting Respondent has no such right. 
26. Why is this important? Because the prior orders granting Petitioner exclusive
possession of the home (and excluding Respondent) stand in direct conflict with the parties’ property rights and the status quo. Those orders were based not on any finding that Respondent lacked ownership or rights to the home, but presumably on a temporary  need for protection 
(which, as shown, was falsely claimed). With the exposure of Petitioner’s allegations as false, there remains no lawful basis  to keep Respondent out of a home that he owns jointly. Texas M.2271 M.2271
M.2271 M.2271 M.2271 M.2271

Family Code § 153.003 states that the Court cannot condition a parent’s possession of a child on 
the payment of support or other matters unrelated to the child – likewise, the Court should not condition Respondent’s access to his home (and thereby to his children) on a procedurally flawed prior order, especially when Petitioner herself admits the home is community property . The 
protective order application further underscores that Petitioner’s sole claim to the home was through a temporary court order, not any independent right. When the predicate for that temporary order (alleged family violence) is unproven and disputed, the underlying property rights must prevail.  
27. In equity, where two parties have equal right to possession of a property, one cannot
exclude the other absent a valid court order supported by good cause. Here, absent the now-questionable temporary orders, Respondent as joint owner would be free to live in his home. The Court should thus give weight to Petitioner’s admission of joint ownership and recognize Respondent’s unabated property right . This is yet another reason to allow the SAPCR to go 
forward: so that the issue of residency and possession of the home can be revisited in light of the true facts and rights of the parties. The protective order was leveraged into a settlement which both partie s did not agree to (as the record will show, if needed), meaning no long- term 
restrictions were found warranted. What remains is a fit father who co -owns his home seeking to 
return  to his necessity to work and provide financially for the children . Petitioner’s own 
pleadings remove any doubt about his entitlement. Accordingly, the Clerk and Court should not hesitate to facilitate Respondent’s return via new temporary orders in this SAPCR, as even Petitioner’s sworn statements support Respondent’s position . 
H. Rule 12 Motion: Opposing Counsel Lacks Authority, Undermining the Divorce CaseM.2272 M.2272
M.2272 M.2272 M.2272 M.2272

Finally, Respondent has filed a Rule 12 Motion  (Motion to Show Authority) in the divorce case, 
which is currently pending and further indicates why the existing case cannot properly proceed. 
In that motion (filed September 20, 2024), Respondent challenged the authority of Petitioner’s attorney of reco rd to act on her behalf.  
28. This challenge was not made lightly – it is supported by evidence that Petitioner’s
counsel never filed  the pleadings , is not authorized to practice in this matter under her current 
registration, and may not even have a valid engagement with Petitioner. Notably, since that motion was filed, Petitioner’s counsel has failed to respond to it or otherwise prove her authority . Rule 12 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provides that an attorney challenged by 
such a motion must appear and show authority to act  for the client, or else be struck from the 
case. Petitioner’s counsel has not met this burden. Instead, irregularities have abounded: at a recent hearing (on Respondent’s motion to recuse), Petitioner’s counsel appeared without 
having answered the Rule 12 motion , and the Court allowed her to argue on a motion she did 
not respond to , but her authority remains in question.. Moreover, it came to light that Petitioner’s 
counsel has been unable to e -file pleadings on her client’s behalf  because her electronic filing 
account is in disarray (registered under a former employer’s email at Cantey Hanger yet is signing pleadings for Marx, Altman, & Johnson) . In fact, the few documents “filed” in the 
divorce case on Petitioner’s side were filed  by Roderick Marx, not by the attorney herself . And 
tellingly, Petitioner’s counsel failed to file the Notice of Remand  after the federal court sent the 
case back, leaving the case hanging indefinitely. All of this demonstrates that Petitioner’s counsel is effectively not acting with proper authority or competence  in the divorce matter.  
29.This is critical because if Petitioner’s attorney lacks authority, then Petitioner is
essentially unrepresented  in the divorce. Her pleadings (including the Original Petition for M.2273 M.2273
M.2273 M.2273 M.2273 M.2273

Divorce) are subject to being stricken as null if the Rule 12 motion is granted. The entire divorce 
proceeding would be a nullity without an authorized petitioner or counsel – which is another reason it has stagnated. It would be unjust to make the childre n wait for months while this issue 
is sorted out. By contrast, in a new SAPCR, Petitioner can secure proper counsel or proceed pro se, but the Rule 12 quagmire in the divorce case can be sidestepped for now to get the children relief. The pending Rule 12 motion underscores that the divorce case is on unstable footing. It is procedurally snarled by questions of representation. On the other hand, Respondent is ready to proceed in the SAPCR immediately  – he, as the petitioner in the SAPCR, obviously has 
authority to bring it, and he will serve Petitioner directly. If Petitioner’s prior counsel truly has no authority, Petitioner will have to either hire new counsel or represent herself in responding to t he 
SAPCR, but at least the case will move forward . The Rule 12 fiasco in the divorce should not be 
allowed to delay relief for the children. Equity again favors moving to a forum (the SAPCR) where all parties before the Court are indisputably authorized and the merits can be reached without distraction.  
30. In summary on this point, Respondent’s Rule 12 motion (which remains unanswered)
indicates that the opposing attorney “has no authority to act for the party” – a situation which, by rule, would mandate striking her pleadings and possibly dismissing the divorce. Rather than let the case devolve into that chaos (to the children’s detriment), the Court should start fresh with this SAPCR. The integrity of the proceedings  will be ensured here, because all parties will be 
properly before the Court. Respondent is confident that once this SAPCR is active, Petitioner will either appear on her own or with legitimate counsel and the issues can finally be adjudicated on the merit s. Until then, the divorce case cannot be trusted as a vehicle for relief due to the M.2274 M.2274
M.2274 M.2274 M.2274 M.2274

cloud over Petitioner’s representation. This factor strongly supports accepting the SAPCR as a 
standalone action and granting the requested hearing and relief without delay. 
I.Conclusion
31.For all the foregoing reasons – lack of prosecution in the divorce, Petitioner’s waiver
of opposition, the children’s urgent needs, the void nature of prior orders, the necessity of 
restoring the status quo, and procedural snares in the divorce case – Respondent respectfully urges the Clerk to file the enclosed SAPCR as a new cause of action, and requests that the Court set an immediate EX -PARTE hearing on temporary orders  in this SAPCR  to issue 
injunctive relief immediately allowing acc ess back into the residency and children ’s lives. 
The Court has abundant legal justification and equitable grounds to do so. Most importantly, the children’s welfare compels immediate action , and the Petitioner will not be adversely 
affected by this decision , and has immediate housing options nearby available to her, 
contrary to the undersigned.  Every factor discussed above converges on one truth: these 
children need their father back and need a stable, working court order to govern their custody and care – and they need it now, not months from now. By allowing this SAPCR to proceed separately, t he Court will cut the Gordian knot that the divorce case has become and will be able 
to issue orders truly serving the children’s best interests forthwith . 
32. Respondent is prepared to appear for an emergency hearing on any date and time  the
Court can accommodate – preferably today. He is also prepared to file any additional supporting documents or evidence the Court may require. All necessary filing fees for this SAPCR are being paid, and service of process will be promptly effected on the opposing party. We ask only that the Clerk accept this filing  (rather than reject or re -route it to the old cause) and that the Court 
immediately calendar the case for a hearing at the earliest possible date. If there are any M.2275 M.2275
M.2275 M.2275 M.2275 M.2275

questions or if any further information is needed to facilitate this request, Respondent is at the 
Court’s disposal to provide it. 
33. Thank you very much for your prompt attention to this urgent matter. By taking swift
action, the Clerk and Court will literally be changing the lives of two children for the better. The law and justice are on the side of moving forward with this SAPCR. Respondent implores the Court to do so without delay. 
Respectfully submitted,
