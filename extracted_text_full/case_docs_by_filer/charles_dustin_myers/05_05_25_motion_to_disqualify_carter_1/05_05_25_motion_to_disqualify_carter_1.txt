IN THE 322nd DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY , TEXAS  
TO THE HONORABLE COURT:  
Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, hereby moves to disqualify COOPER L.  
CARTER, opposing counsel for Petitioner, MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS, from this matter, 
and in support thereof, shows the court the following: 
I. INTRODUCTION
1. Cooper L. Carter was allegedly retained on January 22, 2024, in the lobby of the
courtroom minutes before a scheduled reset hearing regarding a protective order originally  filed 
on December 22, 2023. This hearing was due to begin in front of Associate Judge Jeff Kaitcer . IN THE INTEREST OF M.E.M., C.R.M., two 
children) MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS

and her initial retainment led to the rescheduli ng of the matter for February 1, 2024. Her 
signature first appears on the document entitled “322ND FAMILY DISTRICT COURT 
ASSOCIATE JUDGE'S REPORT”. This initial pleading signed by Ms. Carter indicates that 
she was retained in her individual capacity, further reiterated in the FIRST AMENDED 
PETITION FOR DIVORCE, filed on January 30, 2024.  Specifically, she states: “It was necessary 
for Petitioner  to secure th e services of Cooper L. Carter, a licensed attorney, to prepare and 
prosecute this suit.” (page 9) 
2. Directly below this statement appears the letterhead MARX, ALTMAN & JOHNSON,  
a law firm operated by RODERICK D. MARX, the founder. To date, Mr. Marx’s signature does 
not appear on any pleadings filed in this matter. Notably, every pleading filed for the petitioner 
has been “On Behalf of Cooper Carter by Roderick Marx.” (page 11, Exhibit 4) In total, after 
fourteen months of litigation, Ms. Carter has had the Amended Petition for Divorce, a Motion for 
Pre-T rial Conference5, and a Motion to Consolidate filed on her behalf by Mr. Marx.6 
II. AMBIGUITY
3. When turning to Ms. Carter’s public social media, the ambiguity becomes apparent. On  
her Facebook page, she claims to be a “Former Attorney at Marx, Altman & Johnson”.1 On her 
LinkedIn profile, this is reiterated, where she claims to have worked for Mar x, Altman & 
Johnson from December of 2020 until July of 2022, and claims to currently be employed with 
Cantey Hangar LLP as well as with ‘Associate Attorney’2. Finally, when viewing her Texas State 
Bar profile, she claims to be employed with Mar x Altma n & Johnson, with the last update being

on November 5th, 2023. It’s important to note that “Marx Altman & Johnson” is not the same as 
“Marx, Altman & Johnson”, the comma being the differentiator. These points were discussed in 
the Rule 12 Motion to Show Authority filed and served to Ms. Carter on September 20, 2024, which remains unresolved. It’s further concerning that Ms. Carter is unable to file documents herself using the Electronic Filing Manager as required by Rule 21a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, as it is registered under her prior employer’s email address under Cantey Hanger. 
III. GROUNDS FOR DISQUALIFICATION 
4. A trial court has broad discretion to determine the consequences of professional 
misconduct. State Bar of Texas v. Kilpatrick , 874 S.W.2d 656, 659 (Tex.1994). There is a strong 
presumption in favor of a party’s right to counsel of choice, but this presumption can be overridden by considerations relating to the integrity of the judicial process and the fair administration of just ice Gonzalez v. State , 117 S.W.3d 831 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003). If an 
attorney’s dishonesty threatens the fairness of the proceedings or the public’s confidence in the 
legal system, disqualification may be justified to preserve the integrity of the process.  
 5. However, disqualification is not automatic upon a finding of dishonesty. The court 
must find that the conduct has materially affected the proceedings or the rights of the parties. In other words, disqualification is considered a severe remedy and is reserved for cases where lesser sanctions would be inadequate to address the harm or protect the integrity of the proceedings. Courts are also mindful of the potential for disqualification motions to be used as tactical weapons and require a high standard of proof before granting such relief. See Spears v. Fourth Court of Appeals , 797 S.W.2d 654 (Tex. 1990). The courts also consider the severity and 
circumstances of the misconduct, the harm caused to clients or the profession, and the need to deter future misconduct. See Kilpatrick . In family law matters, where the stakes are often 
3M.3122 M.3122
M.3122 M.3122 M.3122 M.3122

personal and the proceedings can be contentious, the court’s primary concern is to ensure 
fairness and the proper administration of justice.   
6. On May 9th, 2024, Ms. Carter reached out via email correspondence and requested that 
the Respondent fill out and sign an Income Withholding Order.  After inspection, the Respondent determined that it was defective and requested that the document be corrected. No further correspondence came from Ms. Carter regarding the IWO.  
7. The attached signature blocks raise serious doubts about their authenticity. In one 
version, the cursive signature “Holly L. Hayes” appears above a typed line, followed by a long list of attorneys (with State Bar numbers) ending in “ATTORNEY OF RECORD.” In  the other 
version, the same cursive “Holly L. Hayes” signature appears above the line, but the typed block below shows only “CHOYA BURKLEY” labeled as “ATTORNEY OF RECORD.” These two versions cannot both be true. A single pleading cannot logically have two different attorneys designated as “Attorney of Record,” nor can one attorney’s handwritten signature be grafted onto 
a block naming another attorney. The inconsistencies strongly indicate that the signature block 
was manually altered or copied between  documents, constituting a likely forgery.  
8. Furthermore, upon inspection of the Certificate of Service, the font sizes are different, 
and it further points to the real possibility that this document was indeed forged. The timing of the document’s service and the appearance of the signatures themselv es also raise concern. In 
short, these discrepancies, while by themselves may not seem significant – when added into the mix of issues within this case – it answers more questions than it creates.

ANALYSIS  
FIGURE 1  
FIGURE 2  
9. The screenshots above are true and accurate depictions of the OAG Intervention  
pleading filed in this case on June 28, 2025.3

5M.3124 M.3124
M.3124 M.3124 M.3124 M.3124

When examining FIGURE 1 and FIGURE 2 above, key irregularities include:  
i. Multiple Names vs. Single Signatory
10.In the first image, eight attorney names (with SBNs) are listed under one signature
line, whereas the second image shows only one name under the same signature. This suggests 
that an attorney’s signature was replicated on two different sets of printed names. Under Texas law, every pleading “shall be signed by at least one attorney of record in his individual name”. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 57. It is improper to list multiple attorneys under a single signature or to designate more than one attorney as the att orney of record.  
ii. Duplicate and Conflicting Names
11. The name Holly L. Hayes  appears twice in the first block (once in script as the
signature and again in print as one of the listed attorneys). In the second block, Holly L. 
Hayes appears only as the script signature, while CHOYA BURKLEY is the sole printed name 
with the title “Attorney of Record.” Thus , one version implies Hayes is attorney of record and 
the other implies Burkley is. This direct contradiction – the same signature line paired with two 
different names – could only happen if the signature was misappropriated. No valid pleading would have one attorney sign their name while identifying another attorney as counsel. 
iii. Inconsistent Formatting and Fonts
12. The mixture of cursive and all-caps text, the placement of underlines, and the
alignment of titles differ markedly between the two blocks. For example, one shows an ornate underline beneath “Holly L. Hayes” and then a column of names, while the other has a plain signature line and only “CHOYA BURKLEY” below it. These typographical inconsistencies are not found in standard OAG filings. Legitimate Texas OAG child- support pleadings use a single, 
uniform signature block: one typed attorney name (with SBN and contact info) and the title 
6M.3125 M.3125
M.3125 M.3125 M.3125 M.3125

“Attorney o f Record,” all aligned consistentl y. None of  the OAG’s official pleadings include a 
handwritte n signature of one lawyer placed over the typed name of another. 
13. Taken together , the two images show a signature block that appears to have been 
copied or tampered with . The same handwriting is used in both, but the printed names and 
“Attorney of Record” designation do not match. This strongly suggests that an attorney’ s actual 
signature (Holly Hayes’s) was duplicated ont o a document that falsely names Choya Burkley as 
the attorne y of record, or vice versa. Such conduct amounts to forgery or impersonation, 
misleading the court about who is actually representing the state. 
IV. LEGAL STANDARD  
i. Single Attorney Signature Required (Tex. R. Civ. P. 57)
14.Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 57 mandates that  “Every pleading of a party
represented by an attorney shall be signed by at least one attorney of record in his individual 
name, with his State Bar of Texas identification number…”  By its plain terms, an attorney must 
personally sign pleadings. Listing multiple attorneys under one signature line, or having two different attorneys labeled as counsel on the same document, violates this rule. In a proper signature block, the printed na me next to the SBN must match the person who signed. 
ii. One Designated Attorney (Tex. Gov’t Code §402.029(b))
15. In child- support cases, the Attorney General must notify the parties of the specific
“assistant attorney general who is the attorney of record in the case”. This statute assumes only one attorney-of- record at a time. The conflicting blocks here – one identifying Hayes and the 
other identifying Burkley as attorney-of-record – directly contravene this requirement. They 
falsely present two different individuals as the State’s attorney of record in the same case, which is impossible under §402.029. 
7M.3126 M.3126
M.3126 M.3126 M.3126 M.3126

iii. Standard OAG Practice
16.The OAG’s usual practice is to have a single attorney’s name and signature per
pleading, with all contact information in one consistent block. Attorneys do not co-sign a single 
document by listing a group of names; rather , if multiple lawyers work on a case they each f ile 
separate notices or  appearanc e forms. The aberrant f ormat shown i n the images has never be en 
used in valid OAG submissions. 
17. Becaus e Texas law a nd OAG p rocedur e require a single attorney of  record t o sign 
pleadings in his or her own name, the above anomalies strongly suggest fraud. If Ms . Hayes did 
not actuall y sign on behalf of M s. Burkley (or vice versa), then the signature block i s a 
fabrication: a signature was copied and paire d with a false printed name . This unde rmines the 
integrity o f the pleading  and violates the  attorney -signature rules. See Te x. R. Ci v. P. 57. See also 
Tex. Gov’t. Code 402.029. 
V. STANDARD FOR DISQUALIFICATION  
18. Texas courts regard a motion to disqualify counsel as an “extraordinary remedy” that 
should be granted onl y for “compelling reasons.” Disqualificati on impinges on a litigant’s right 
to chosen counsel, so courts apply an “exacti ng standard” before ordering. As our Supreme Court 
explained in In re Sande rs, 153 S. W.3d 54, 57 ( Tex. 2004), quoting Spears v. Fourt h Court , 797 
S.W.2d 654, 656 ( Tex. 1990), “[m]ere allegations of unethical conduct or evidence showing a 
remote pos sibility of  a violation  of the di sciplinary rul es will not suffice” to di squalify a n 
attorne y. 
19. Nonetheless, where true misconduct has occurred – e specially misconduct directly  
affecting the integrity of the proceeding – courts will act. As one court put it, “[t]o protect the 
integrity of the judicial system, a trial court must disqualify counsel whe n continuing 
8M.3127 M.3127
M.3127 M.3127 M.3127 M.3127

representation will taint the trial.” In re Sanders, 153 S.W.3d 54, 57 (Tex. 2004). The moving 
party bears the heavy burden of proving disqualification is warranted . Id. Respondent readily 
meets that burden here, given Carter’s admitted violations of the Rules. 
20. In disqualification motions, Texas courts consider all relevant rules: the Texas Rules 
of Civil Procedure, statutory provisions, and the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct. Under Tex. R. Civ. P. 13, an attorney’s  signature certifies that the pleading is not 
groundless or filed for any improper purpose. Rule 13 further provides that making “statements in pleading which [the signer] know[s] to be ... false, for the purpose of securing a delay” is contemptible. Similarly, Rule 57 requires eac h attorney- of-record to sign pleadings with their 
own name and bar number. Violation of these procedural rules subjects the offending attorney to sanction. Tex. R. Civ. P. 215 authorizes a court to punish contempt or sanction parties for misconduct. Additi onally, courts have inherent authority to enforce ethical standards: the Texas 
Supreme Court has instructed that trial judges have a duty “to regulate the legal profession when 
appropriate via the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct,” which ar e a “preeminent 
source for attorney disqualification” even though the Rules themselves are not. 
iv. Carter’s actions warranting disqualification 
21. Under the Disciplinary Rules, Carter’s actions are manifestly prohibited. Rule 3.03(a) 
(“Candor Toward the Tribunal”) forbids a lawyer from knowingly making false statements of 
material fact to a court or offering evidence the lawyer knows to be false.” Tex. Disciplinary R. Prof. Conduct 3.03(a).  It also requires a lawyer to correct any previous material misstatement to the court. Rule 8.04(a)(3) classifies engaging in “dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation” as professional misconduct . See  Tex. Di sciplinary R. Prof. Conduct 8.04(a)(3).  Rule 1.03 
(Diligence) obligates a lawyer to pursue matters zealously and not neglect a client’s case. Here, 
9M.3128 M.3128
M.3128 M.3128 M.3128 M.3128

Carter’ s deliberate lies (March 14 or ders), failure t o correct them, and long-term ne glect cl early 
violate the se dut ies. 
22. Becaus e Carter’ s misconduct di rectly taints the proceedings, the Court ne ed not  wait 
for a di sciplinary c omplaint. Ins tead,  it may di squalify c ounsel in th e interest of  justice. Texas 
courts hav e done so w hen co unsel’ s actions “prejudice[d] the  fairness of  the proceedings” or 
“violate[d] professiona l standards”. While w e respec t the hi gh standard for disqualification,  
Carter’ s admitted m isdeeds are not  “mere allegations” – they are proven by the record itself – 
and they strike at the he art of a fair trial.  
23. Carter ’s conduct on March 14, 2024, is particularly egregious and independently 
justifies di squalification.  Carter secretly dr afted a nd fil ed te mporary or ders falsely c haracterizing  
them as “Agreed” by Respondent, even though Respondent was present and obj ecting  at a 
hearing purposed to challenge them. This is a knowing misrepresentation of material fact to the 
court , in direct violation of Tex. Disc. R. Prof. Conduct 3.03( a)(1) and 8.04(a)(3). It also 
breaches her Rule 13 certification: by signing and presenting those orders, Carter certified the y 
were not filed for an improper purpose or in bad faith, whic h they clearl y were. Rule 13 
explicitly punishes filing pleadings “which [the signer] know [s] to be groundless and false” with 
contempt. This rule was violated here. 
VI. CONCLUSION  
In totalit y, Ms. Carter’s conduct mirrors not that of a zealous advocate, but rather that of 
an attorne y who has know ingly misled the tribunal, neglected her duties, and corrupted the 
procedural integrity of these proceedings. Her submission of fabricate d “agreed” orders on  
March 14, 2024 — a t a hearing  specifically sche duled t o challenge  thos e very order s — is not 
only unethical, it is a knowing misrepresentati on of material fact, in direct violation of Rule 
10M.3129 M.3129
M.3129 M.3129 M.3129 M.3129

3.03(a)(1)  and Rule 8.04(a)(3)  of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct . See 
In re Meador , 968 S.W.2d 346, 351 (Tex. 1998) (noting that "lawyers must be held to the highest 
standards of honesty and candor when dealing with the courts").  
Additionally, Ms. Carter’s failure to appear at the March 14 hearing, failure to respond to 
challenges, her repeated use of defective or unauthorized signature blocks, and failure to comply 
with Rule 57 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, collectively e vidence a pattern of 
misconduct that is not merely negligent — it is willful, strategic, and fundamentally 
prejudicial . Courts have long held that when counsel's conduct "taints the trial," disqualification 
is not only permitted — it is required. In re Sanders, 153 S.W.3d 54, 57 (Tex. 2004); Spears v. Fourth Ct. of Appeals , 797 S.W.2d 654, 656 (Tex. 1990). 
Under Rule 13  of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure , an attorney's signature certifies 
that pleadings are grounded in fact and law and are not brought for any improper purpose. Filing knowingly false temporary orders without a Motion to Sign, and misrepresenting an agreement 
never made, constitutes sanctio nable conduct. See  Nath v. Tex. Children's Hosp., 446 S.W.3d 
355, 361 (Tex. 2014) (reiterating that sanctions are appropriate where pleadings are made in bad 
faith and lack evidentiary support). 
Furthermore, the potential forgery or misappropriation of the OAG attorney’s signature 
constitutes a separate and grave violation of Rule 57 and Texas Gov’t Code § 402.029. Courts have the inherent authority to sanction and disqualify attorneys for forging or misusing names to file official pleadings. State Bar of Tex. v. Kilpatrick , 874 S.W.2d 656, 659 (Tex. 1994); In re 
C.F ., Jr., 141 S.W.3d 907, 913 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2004, no pet.) (affirming sanctionswhere a party filed enforcement pleadings based  on fictitious orders and failed to appear for 
hearing).

M.3130 M.3130 M.3130 M.3130

Finally, even if Ms. Carter’s conduct did not amount to outright fraud, disqualification 
would still be proper  given her ongoing dereliction of duty — a year of non-prosecution, 
procedural noncompliance, and abandonment of her responsibility to inform the Court of her role 
and authority. The continued presence of such an attorney in this proceeding actively prejud ices 
Respondent, impairs the integrity of the record, and casts a shadow over every action taken in the case. See  In re S.G.B., No. 05-23-00684- CV, 2025 WL 1632427, at *5 (Tex. App.—Dallas Mar. 
13, 2025) (mem. op.) (“Bad faith conduct that disrupts core judicial functions warrants sanction and potential disqualification”). 
VII. PRA YER  
Respondent respectfull y requests that this court: 
1.Immediately set this matter for a hearing following the current recusalproceedings at the earliest opportunity and ORDER Holly Hayes to appear tosubstantiate the intervention pleading ;
2.Require that COOPER L. CARTER prove  her authority to represent
Petitioner, MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS, in this matter.
3. If the court finds the Intervention Pleading to be fraudulent, disqualify
COOPER L. CARTER from the case  without reaching the other points raised
in this brief for fraud upon the court;
4. If the court finds that COOPER L. CARTER cannot show her authority and no
one else appears to represent MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS, strike herpleadings from the record, including the March 14, 2024, temporary orders;
5.Issue any further relief the court deems equitable given the circumstances.
