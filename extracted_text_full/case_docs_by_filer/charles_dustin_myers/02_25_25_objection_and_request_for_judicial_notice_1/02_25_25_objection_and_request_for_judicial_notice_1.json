INTRODUCTION \nWhat incentive does this Court have, if not to uphold the \nvery laws it is sworn to enforce, to restore long-overdue justice in \nthis matter? How many unopposed motions must be filed, and how \nmuch procedural entanglement must be endured, before \nsubstantive relief is granted? This case hinges on a purported \nsettlement agreement that plainly lacks the required consent of \nboth parties, leaving no valid mutual assent. Yet procedural barriers \nand administrative mishandling have thwarted any genuine review \nof these issues.  \nBefore this Court can even see the motion, it must pass \nthrough the same administrative staff whose conduct has hindered \nthe proper adjudication of this dispute. In particular, the Morgan Michelle Myers,   \n  \n  \nPetitioner,   \n  \nv.

Sec. 37.10.  of the Texas Penal Code sets forth the following if a \nGovernmental Record is tampered with:  \n  \u201c(a) A person commits an offense if [s]he:  \ni. knowingly makes a false entry in, or false \nalteration of, a governmental record;  \n ii. makes, presents, or uses any record, document, or thing with knowledge of its falsity and with intent that it be taken as a genuine governmental record;  \n \niii. intentionally destroys, conceals, removes, or otherwise impairs the verity, legibility, or availability of a governmental record;  \n 3.

The Court Coordinator Lacked Legal Authority to Handle the Recusal Filings  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n 1.Coordinators Have No Independent Authority Over F iling \nor Docketing.\nUnder Texas Government Code \u00a7\u00a7 74.101\u201374.106, a court \ncoordinator\u2019s role is strictly administr ative: maintaining the  \njudge\u2019s docket, scheduling hearings, and other nonjudicial  \ntasks. In contrast, the clerk of the court is the official  \ncustodian of court filings, responsible for receiving, filing,  \nand preserving all pleadings.\n2.Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 21(f)(1 1) explicitly states  \nthat once a document is e-f iled in accordance with the rules, \nthe clerk \u201cmay not refuse to file\u201d it, even if  it fails to  \nconform perfectly .

Such an act goes beyond any permissible  \nadministrative function and constitutes a direct interference  \nwith court records and is a criminal offense in Texas.\n4. Coordinators Are Not Granted a Role Under TRCP 18a \nMotions to recuse are governed by Rule 18a of the Texas  \nRules of Civil Procedure, which specifically names the \nclerk of the court, the respondent judge, and the regional  \npresiding judge\u2014 not a court coordinator.\n5.Rule 18a(e): The clerk \u201cmust immediately deliver a copy\u201d \nof the filed recusal motion to the respondent judge and \nregional presiding judge. This duty is the clerk\u2019s alone, not  \nthe coordinator\u2019s.\n6.Rule 18a(f): The respondent judge has three business days \nto act\u2014either recuse voluntarily or refer the motion to the  \nregional presiding judge. Again, no role is assigned to a  \ncoordinator for screening, modifying, or distributing the  \ndocument.\n7.Unauthorized Alteration of Filings C an Constitute \nTampering.",

Because court filings fall within the definition of \u201cgovernmental record\u201d in Penal Code \u00a7 37.01(2), Baker\u2019s unilateral modifications raise serious concerns under the tampering statute, as well as potential violations of due process.  \n9. Accordingly, any action Baker took regarding the recusal motion was ultra vires  (beyond lawful authority) \nand compels the Court to acknowledge that the filing process was improperly subverted. \n  B.
