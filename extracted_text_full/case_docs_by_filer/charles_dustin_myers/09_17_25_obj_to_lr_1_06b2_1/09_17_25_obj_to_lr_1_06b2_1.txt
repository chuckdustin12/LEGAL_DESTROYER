TO THE HONORABLE 322ND DISTRICT CO UR T O F TARRANT CO U NTY, TEXAS: 
COMES NOW , Charles Dustin Myers, Respondent  in the 
above captioned cause, 
who respectfully submits this OBJECTION TO LOCAL RULE 1.06(b) (2) AND FOR JUDICIAL 
NOTICE to place on the record that he 
objects to any future handling of this matter by Court 
Coordinator Lindsey Baker  and that Respondent has no choice but to pursue a federal claim . 
Lindsey Baker, as court coordinator , exemplifies t he problem of  unequal t reatment  of pro 
se litigants w hen he r actions —such as altering or withholding parts of a pro se party’s court 
filing —result in procedural disadvantages that are not faced by represented parties, thereby 
undermining the cons titutional guarantee of equal protection unde r Texas law. Her conduct, as 
described,  high lights how  cour t s t aff c an perpetuate or  institutionalize preferential t reatment, 
which i s cons t itutionally s uspect and  contrary t o the principles of  fa irness and  access t o justice. 
I. SUMMARY

represented by  counsel or  appearing  pro se, receive  equal treatment i n the judicial p rocess. When

 such as modifying, splitting, or omitting parts of their filings —this not only creates procedural 
barriers but also risks violating the constitutional mandate of equal protection and due process. 
 2. Lindsey Baker’s actions, as alleged, serve as a textbook example of how court staff 
can, intentionally or not, create a two -tiered system that favors attorneys and their clients over 
unrepresented parties. Such conduct is particularly problematic because c ourt coordinators wield 
significant administrative power and discretion, and their preferential treatment of represented parties can have a direct and detrimental impact on the substantive and procedural rights of pro se litigants, undermining both the  appearance and reality of justice.  
II. BACKGROUND AND RELEVANT LAW  
A. Legislative Framework  
 3. The Texas Constitution, specifically Article 1, Section 3, enshrines the principle that all 
individuals are entitled to equal rights and protection under the law, and that no person or group is entitled to exclusive privileges except in consideration of pu blic service, see Tex. Const. art. 1 
§ 3 Equal Rights. This constitutional guarantee is directly implicated when court officials, including coordinators, treat similarly situated litigants differently based solely on their representation status.  
 4. Texas Penal Code § 32.46 criminalizes the act of causing another person, with intent to 
defraud or harm, to sign or execute any document affecting property or pecuniary interest without effective consent. It also prohibits causing a public servant to file or record a document purporting to memorialize an act or order of a purported court or judicial officer not established by law .  This provision is relevant where court staff manipulate or alter court documents in a way 
that affects a party’s property or legal interests.

  5. The Texas Government Code authorizes judges to appoint court coordinators to 
improve justice and expedite case processing, and these coordinators serve at the pleasure of the 
appointing judge, see  Tex. Gov't. Code § 74.101. This structure gives coordinators significant 
administrative discretion, but also places a duty on them to act impartially and in accordance with constitutional mandates.  
 6. Additionally, court staff are required to maintain the confidentiality of non -public 
judicial work product, and improper handling or disclosure of such materials can constitute a 
criminal offense, see Tex. Gov't. Code § 21.013. 
B. Jurisprudence  
 7. Texas jurisprudence outlines  that the state’s equal protection clause provides the same 
guarantees as the federal Fourteenth Amendment, requiring that all individuals, including 
litigants, be treated equally by the courts, see Ho v. University of Texas at Arlington , 984 S.W.2d 
672 (Tex. App. 1998). The court in Ho  emphasized that any practice or rule resulting in disparate 
treatment of pro se litigants as compared to those represented by counsel could raise serious constitutional concerns.  
 8. The importance of impartiality and the avoidance of personal interests interfering with 
judicial or quasi -judicial duties is further underscored in State v. Terrazas , 962 S.W.2d 38 (Tex. 
Crim. App. 1998), which, while addressing prosecutorial conduct, is instructive for the broader 
principle that court officials must avoid conduct that undermines procedural fairness and due 
process . 
 9. By applying these principles, the court can avoid any appearance of impropriety or a 
risk of being seen as impartial .

 III. Analysis  
C. Application of Equal Protection Principles to Lindsey Baker’s Conduct  
 10. The core constitutional issue is whether Lindsey Baker’s actions as court coordinator 
resulted in pro se litigants being treated less favorably than represented parties, thereby violating 
the equal protection guarantees of the Texas Constitution and the Fo urteenth Amendment. The 
Texas Constitution’s equal rights provision is unequivocal: all individuals are entitled to equal treatment, and no one is entitled to special privileges absent a public service justification, see Tex. Const. art. 1 § 3 Equal Rights.  
 11. In the instant matter  described, Lindsey Baker altered  Respondent ’s joint motion to 
recuse by removing exhibits and affidavits, splitting the document, and removing hyperlinks after the motion was filed and served. These actions, which are facially supported by the record, directly impact the Respondent ’s ability to present their case fully and effectively, and may result 
in the presiding judge or reviewing authority not having access to the complete record. Such conduct creates a procedural disadvantage for the pro se litigant that is not faced by parties  
represented by counsel, who may have the resources or relationships to ensure their filings are handled correctly.  
 12. Furthermore, when questioned about these modifications, Baker’s explanations were 
illogical and contradictory to how filings are typically handled. Together, these actions create a 
scenario where her involvement in the case is prejudicial to the Respo ndent.  
 13. This type of disparate treatment is precisely what the equal protection clause is 
designed to prevent. As the Texas Court of Appeals made clear in  Ho v. University of Texas at 
Arlington , 984 S.W.2d 672 (Tex. App. 1998), the state’s equal protection clause is coextensive

5 
 with the federal standard, and any practice that results in pro se litigants being systematically 
disadvantaged is constitutionally suspect.  
 14. Moreover, the administrative discretion granted to court coordinators under Tex. 
Gov't. Code § 74.101 does not override the constitutional requirement of equal treatment. While coordinators are tasked with expediting case processing and improving justice, these objectives 
must be pursued in a manner that is neutral and non-discriminatory. Preferential treatment of 
attorneys or their clients, whether through informal relationships or deliberate manipulation of 
filings, is inconsistent with both the lett er and spirit of the law.  
 15. Here, Lindsey Baker’s involvement has only created ambiguities, delays, and 
unexplained conduct that is criminal in nature.  
D. Procedural Unfairness and Access to Justice 
 16. The problem is not merely theoretical. Procedural disadvantages —such as missing 
exhibits, altered documents, or incomplete filings —can have real and substantial effects on a 
litigant’s ability to obtain relief, respond to adverse actions, or appeal unfavorable decisions. 
These barriers are particularly acute for pro se parties, who may lack the legal knowledge or resources to identify and correct such errors. 
E. Potential Criminal and Civil Liability  
 17. Beyond constitutional concerns, Lindsey Baker’s conduct may also implicate criminal 
statutes. Under  Tex. Pen. Code § 32.46, it is a criminal offense to cause another person, with 
intent to defraud or harm, to sign or execute any document affecting property or pecuniary 
interest without effective consent. If a court coordinator alters or manipulates court documents in

6 
 a way that affects a party’s legal or property interests, and does so with the requisite intent, this 
could constitute a violation of the statute.  
 18. Additionally, the requirement for court staff to maintain the confidentiality and 
integrity of judicial work product, as set out in Tex. Gov't. Code § 21.013, which underscores the seriousness of mishandling or altering court filings. Breaches of these duties can have both 
criminal and professional consequences , which Respondent seeks to pursue if this Court 
continues to disregard the law.  
F. The Role of Discretion and Institutional Practices  
 19. The structure of the court coordinator system in Texas, as described in Tex. Gov't. 
Code § 74.101, gives coordinators significant administrative power, but also places them under 
the direct supervision of the appointing judge. This arrangement can create a n environment 
where informal relationships or unwritten practices develop, potentially leading to preferential treatment of certain parties. When such practices result in pro se litigants being disadvantaged, they are constitutionally problematic.  
 20. The secondary materials highlight the need for clear guidelines and training for court 
staff to ensure that all litigants are treated fairly, regardless of representation status. Without such safeguards, the risk of institutionalizing unequal treatment is significant.  
 21. The appearance of fairness is as important as its reality. When court staff are 
perceived to favor attorneys or their clients over pro se parties, public confidence in the judiciary is undermined. The due process rights of litigants are not limited to the outcome of their cases, but extend to the procedures by which those outcomes are reached. Any deviation from impartial and equal treatment threatens the legitimacy of the judicial system as a whole.

7 IV. CONCLUSION 
Lindsey B aker’s conduc t as cour t coordinator, as d escribed,  is a clear ex ample of  how 
court s taff can pe rpetuate or  institutionalize unequal treatment  of pro se litigants, i n violation  of 
the constitutional gua rantee of equ al protection  unde r Texas l aw. By altering or withholding parts 
of a pro se party’s court filing, Baker created procedural disadvantages that are not faced by 
represented p arties, unde rmining  both the  appearan ce and  reality of  fairness i n the judicial 
process. The  Texas Constitution,  relevant  statutes, and  case law al l require that al l litigants be  
treated equ ally, and any deviation  from this standard —whether t hrough formal rules or informal 
practices —risks both constitutional violation and loss of public confidence in the courts . The 
judiciary and cou rt staff must be  vigilant i n ens uring  that all p arties, r egardless of  representation,  
have equal a ccess t o justice and are not s ubjected t o systemic disadvantages. 
Accordingl y, and for all the reasons stated above, Respondent OBJECTS to any further 
involvement in this matter by court coordinator Lindsey Baker. 
The Court is also put on official not ice that F ederal pr oceedings  will commenc e in t he 
coming days . The Court should consider issuing an immediate stay as soon as possible 
considering  Baker, C arter, and ot hers cur rently pr esiding  over this cas e will be  named as 
defendants. 
This n otice and objection are filed in good faith as Respondent is not obligated to provide 
such not ice. 
If the court chooses not to stay these proceedings, Respondent hereby invokes his right to 
a trial by jur y, and object s to the final trial setting scheduled for December 1 0, 2025, being heard 
by District Judge James Munford, as he will also be named a defendant.

8 Due to the court’ s collective failures and unexplained abnormalities, Respondent has no 
other option, abse nt relief, but to initiate proceedings to protect his children, his interests, and his 
rights.  
Respondent asks the Court to take judicial notice of these issues.
