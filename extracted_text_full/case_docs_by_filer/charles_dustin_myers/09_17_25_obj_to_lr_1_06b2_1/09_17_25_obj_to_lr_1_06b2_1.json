Lindsey Baker\u2019s actions, as alleged, serve as a textbook example of how court staff \ncan, intentionally or not, create a two -tiered system that favors attorneys and their clients over \nunrepresented parties. Such conduct is particularly problematic because c ourt coordinators wield \nsignificant administrative power and discretion, and their preferential treatment of represented parties can have a direct and detrimental impact on the substantive and procedural rights of pro se litigants, undermining both the  appearance and reality of justice.  \nII. BACKGROUND AND RELEVANT LAW  \nA. Legislative Framework  \n 3. The Texas Constitution, specifically Article 1, Section 3, enshrines the principle that all \nindividuals are entitled to equal rights and protection under the law, and that no person or group is entitled to exclusive privileges except in consideration of pu blic service, see Tex. Const. art. 1 \n\u00a7 3 Equal Rights. This constitutional guarantee is directly implicated when court officials, including coordinators, treat similarly situated litigants differently based solely on their representation status.  \n 4. Texas Penal Code \u00a7 32.46 criminalizes the act of causing another person, with intent to \ndefraud or harm, to sign or execute any document affecting property or pecuniary interest without effective consent. It also prohibits causing a public servant to file or record a document purporting to memorialize an act or order of a purported court or judicial officer not established by law .  This provision is relevant where court staff manipulate or alter court documents in a way \nthat affects a party\u2019s property or legal interests.",

The Texas Government Code authorizes judges to appoint court coordinators to \nimprove justice and expedite case processing, and these coordinators serve at the pleasure of the \nappointing judge, see  Tex. Gov't. Code \u00a7 74.101. This structure gives coordinators significant \nadministrative discretion, but also places a duty on them to act impartially and in accordance with constitutional mandates.  \n 6. Additionally, court staff are required to maintain the confidentiality of non -public \njudicial work product, and improper handling or disclosure of such materials can constitute a \ncriminal offense, see Tex. Gov't. Code \u00a7 21.013. \nB. Jurisprudence  \n 7. Texas jurisprudence outlines  that the state\u2019s equal protection clause provides the same \nguarantees as the federal Fourteenth Amendment, requiring that all individuals, including \nlitigants, be treated equally by the courts, see Ho v. University of Texas at Arlington , 984 S.W.2d \n672 (Tex. App. 1998). The court in Ho  emphasized that any practice or rule resulting in disparate \ntreatment of pro se litigants as compared to those represented by counsel could raise serious constitutional concerns.  \n 8. The importance of impartiality and the avoidance of personal interests interfering with \njudicial or quasi -judicial duties is further underscored in State v. Terrazas , 962 S.W.2d 38 (Tex. \nCrim. App. 1998), which, while addressing prosecutorial conduct, is instructive for the broader \nprinciple that court officials must avoid conduct that undermines procedural fairness and due \nprocess . \n 9. By applying these principles, the court can avoid any appearance of impropriety or a \nrisk of being seen as impartial .",

The core constitutional issue is whether Lindsey Baker\u2019s actions as court coordinator \nresulted in pro se litigants being treated less favorably than represented parties, thereby violating \nthe equal protection guarantees of the Texas Constitution and the Fo urteenth Amendment. The \nTexas Constitution\u2019s equal rights provision is unequivocal: all individuals are entitled to equal treatment, and no one is entitled to special privileges absent a public service justification, see Tex. Const. art. 1 \u00a7 3 Equal Rights.  \n 11. In the instant matter  described, Lindsey Baker altered  Respondent \u2019s joint motion to \nrecuse by removing exhibits and affidavits, splitting the document, and removing hyperlinks after the motion was filed and served. These actions, which are facially supported by the record, directly impact the Respondent \u2019s ability to present their case fully and effectively, and may result \nin the presiding judge or reviewing authority not having access to the complete record. Such conduct creates a procedural disadvantage for the pro se litigant that is not faced by parties  \nrepresented by counsel, who may have the resources or relationships to ensure their filings are handled correctly.  \n 12. Furthermore, when questioned about these modifications, Baker\u2019s explanations were \nillogical and contradictory to how filings are typically handled. Together, these actions create a \nscenario where her involvement in the case is prejudicial to the Respo ndent.  \n 13. This type of disparate treatment is precisely what the equal protection clause is \ndesigned to prevent. As the Texas Court of Appeals made clear in  Ho v. University of Texas at \nArlington , 984 S.W.2d 672 (Tex. App. 1998), the state\u2019s equal protection clause is coextensive",

Moreover, the administrative discretion granted to court coordinators under Tex. \nGov't. Code \u00a7 74.101 does not override the constitutional requirement of equal treatment. While coordinators are tasked with expediting case processing and improving justice, these objectives \nmust be pursued in a manner that is neutral and non-discriminatory. Preferential treatment of \nattorneys or their clients, whether through informal relationships or deliberate manipulation of \nfilings, is inconsistent with both the lett er and spirit of the law.  \n 15. Here, Lindsey Baker\u2019s involvement has only created ambiguities, delays, and \nunexplained conduct that is criminal in nature.  \nD. Procedural Unfairness and Access to Justice \n 16. The problem is not merely theoretical. Procedural disadvantages \u2014such as missing \nexhibits, altered documents, or incomplete filings \u2014can have real and substantial effects on a \nlitigant\u2019s ability to obtain relief, respond to adverse actions, or appeal unfavorable decisions. \nThese barriers are particularly acute for pro se parties, who may lack the legal knowledge or resources to identify and correct such errors. \nE. Potential Criminal and Civil Liability  \n 17. Beyond constitutional concerns, Lindsey Baker\u2019s conduct may also implicate criminal \nstatutes. Under  Tex. Pen. Code \u00a7 32.46, it is a criminal offense to cause another person, with \nintent to defraud or harm, to sign or execute any document affecting property or pecuniary \ninterest without effective consent. If a court coordinator alters or manipulates court documents in",

Additionally, the requirement for court staff to maintain the confidentiality and \nintegrity of judicial work product, as set out in Tex. Gov't. Code \u00a7 21.013, which underscores the seriousness of mishandling or altering court filings. Breaches of these duties can have both \ncriminal and professional consequences , which Respondent seeks to pursue if this Court \ncontinues to disregard the law.  \nF. The Role of Discretion and Institutional Practices  \n 19. The structure of the court coordinator system in Texas, as described in Tex. Gov't. \nCode \u00a7 74.101, gives coordinators significant administrative power, but also places them under \nthe direct supervision of the appointing judge. This arrangement can create a n environment \nwhere informal relationships or unwritten practices develop, potentially leading to preferential treatment of certain parties. When such practices result in pro se litigants being disadvantaged, they are constitutionally problematic.  \n 20. The secondary materials highlight the need for clear guidelines and training for court \nstaff to ensure that all litigants are treated fairly, regardless of representation status. Without such safeguards, the risk of institutionalizing unequal treatment is significant.  \n 21. The appearance of fairness is as important as its reality. When court staff are \nperceived to favor attorneys or their clients over pro se parties, public confidence in the judiciary is undermined. The due process rights of litigants are not limited to the outcome of their cases, but extend to the procedures by which those outcomes are reached. Any deviation from impartial and equal treatment threatens the legitimacy of the judicial system as a whole.",

CONCLUSION \nLindsey B aker\u2019s conduc t as cour t coordinator, as d escribed,  is a clear ex ample of  how \ncourt s taff can pe rpetuate or  institutionalize unequal treatment  of pro se litigants, i n violation  of \nthe constitutional gua rantee of equ al protection  unde r Texas l aw.
