Respondent further provides legal authority under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, Texas Family Code, and controlling case law  to support the relief requested.

They are being subjected to psychological manipulation and \nmedical neglect  by Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, resulting in deteriorating mental \nhealth and emotional wellbeing. For instance, the children are being gaslighted by \nPetitioner into the false belief that the divorce case has already been finalized, causing confusion and distress. These allegations \u2013 including psychological harm, medical neglect, emotional alienation, and academic decline  \u2013 are well -documented in exhibits \npreviously provided to Petitioner\u2019s counsel. To date, neither Petitioner nor her counsel has refu ted or even responded to these serious charges of ongoing harm to the children. \n  \n B.Children Left in Unsafe Conditions\n2.Petitioner has repeatedly left the young children home alone at night without  \nany adult supervision. This creates an obvious and unacceptable safety risk. Respondent has raised this issue, yet Petitioner and her counsel have offered no denial or explanation. At present, the children have been removed from Respondent\u2019s daily care and placed with their elderly great -grandparents. This abrupt change in living situation occurred after \nRespondent \u2013 their father \u2013 was unlawfully locked out  of the family home on March 6, \n2024. Since that date, Respondent has been prevented from accessing his home and caring for the children, disrupting the only stable parenting they have known. \nC.\n Unlawful Lockout and Resulting Damages",

Petitioner\u2019s unilateral actions have caused Respondent significant harm: he has suffered approximately $110,500 in verifiable financial damages  due to \nthe unlawful lockout, loss of use of the residence, and the interruption of his parent -child \nrelationship. This damage continues to accrue as the Respondent remains barred from his home and from normal contact with the children.

Facially Void and Inconsistent Orders  \n4. The \u201ccurrent orders\u201d governing possession of the children were obtained by \nPetitioner through pleadings and procedures that are facially inconsistent and legally inadequate. On their face, the orders claim consent of all parties yet only bear the signatures of the Petitioner and her Counsel.

On that date, Ms. Carter filed a Motion for Pre -Trial Conference \u2013 \nthe last  action she took in this matter until very recently.

During this period of dormancy, Respondent (pro se) repeatedly sought relief to address the children\u2019s situation, yet Ms. Carter never filed a single objection, response, or argument  to counter Respondent\u2019s motions  or \nrequests for relief . Serious and well -documented allegations \u2013 including child \nendangerment and de facto custody interference \u2013 went completely unanswered by \nPetitioner and her counsel for over a year.  \nG.

Civ. P. 12 challenging whether Ms. Carter truly has authority to \nrepresent Petitioner  and clear up the ambiguity surrounding her representation.

Respondent\u2019s Rule 12 motion puts Ms. Carter to the burden of proving her authority to act; tellingly, in the 14 months of litigation Ms. Carter has yet to produce any client authority or engagement , and she ignored the Rule 12 challenge just as she ignored \nevery other filing.

The very first involvement by Ms. Carter since April 2024 was to appear at the eleventh hour in the 233rd District Court and object to the TRO hearing  \nthrough a phone call without ever responding to the TRO or arguing against it . \nSimultaneously, she filed a Motion to Consolidate the new SAPCR case back into the old 322nd Distr ict Court divorce case \u2013 a case that has been dormant and effectively stalled \nunder void orders. In doing so, Ms. Carter offered no substantive rebuttal to any of \nRespondent\u2019s factual allegations (1\u20139 above). She provided no explanation for her prolonged a bsence or her client\u2019s failures  and inconsistencies , and no justification as to \nhow consolidation would serve the children\u2019s best interests .

As repeatedly stated - every day that passes without corrective action is a day \nin which the children remain in an unstable, harmful environment. Respondent has relentlessly pursued lawful avenues to restore the prior stable status quo for the children, only to be met with procedural stonewalling. It would be highly prejudicial  to reward \nPetitioner and her counsel\u2019s negligence and gamesmanship by allowing further delay \nthrough consolidation. Indeed, to do so would blatantly disregard Respondent\u2019s rights  \nand, more importantly, the children\u2019s best interests . The time has come for the Court to \nrecognize that Petitioner\u2019s counsel \u2013 despite holding a law license \u2013 has forfeited any entitlement to deference through her conduct.

Under Texas law, any judgment based upon a purported agreement of the parties requires \u201cunequivocal conse nt at the time of rendition\u201d, and if a party withdraws consent before the judgment is \nrendered, the judgment is void. See Burnaman v. Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 (Tex. 1951) (holding that when a trial court has knowledge that one party does not consent to a judgment, it is error to render a judgment purportedly by agreement; such a judgment is a nullity) . Likewise, Padilla v. LaFrance , 907 S.W.2d 454 (Tex. 1995) confirms that a trial \ncourt cannot render an agreed judgment after a party has withdrawn consent to a settlement . In short, if one party withheld or withdrew consent, the only method to \nresolve the dispute is a trial on the merits, not entry of an \u201cagreed\u201d order . \n14.

In this case, the 322nd District Court never rendered a final order resolving \nthe SAPCR or divorce \u2013 the orders in place are interlocutory and void.

Respondent unequivocally objects to the consolidation of the new child \ncustody case (SAPCR) with the dormant divorce case and asks this Court to deny any \nsuch motion to consolidate.

The First -Filed Divorce Case Does Not Have \u201cDominant Jurisdiction\u201d  \n22. Generally, when two suits involving the same subject matter are pending in \ndifferent courts of equal jurisdiction, the court in which the suit was first filed has dominant jurisdiction and the latter  is typically abated. See Wyatt v. Shaw Plumbing Co., \n760 S.W.2d 245, 247 (Tex. 1988) (citing Cleveland v. Ward, 116 Tex. 1, 285 S.W. 1063 (1926)). However, Texas law recognizes critical exceptions to the \u201cfirst -filed\u201d rule. The \nTexas Supreme Court in Wyatt  reiterated three well -established exceptions: \u201c(1) conduct \nby a party that estops him from asserting prior active jurisdiction; (2) lack of persons to \nbe joined if feasible; and (3) lack of intent to prosecute the first lawsuit.\u201d  (quoting V .D. \nAnderson Co. v. Young, 101 S.W.2d 798 (Tex. 1937); Curtis v. Gibbs , 511 S.W.2d 263 \n(Tex. 1974)). If any of these exceptio ns apply, the court with the first filing does not  have \ndominant jurisdiction, and the second court may proceed. Wyatt , 760 S.W.2d at 248. \n23. Here, at least two  of the exceptions squarely apply, both flowing from \nPetitioner\u2019s and Ms. Carter\u2019s conduct in the divorce case . \nB. Estoppel by Conduct",

She allowed that case to become completely \ndormant and failed to notify the Court or Respondent of the case\u2019s status after the federal \nremand. By failing to comply with Rule 237a\u2019s notice requirements  and effectively \nconcealing the revival of the state case from proceeding on the merits, consolidation is inappropriate without some form of input from the opposing side. \n25. Petitioner\u2019s counsel also did nothing to set hearings or trial, effectively \nrepresenting that she had abandoned the case. Petitioner cannot now, at the last minute, resurrect that case to block a new one \u2013 equity and fair play will not permit a party to \nsleep on her rights and then use the prior filing as a weapon. Petitioner\u2019s conduct is \nprecisely the kind that warrants estoppel from asserting dominant jurisdiction. \nC. Lack of Intent to Prosecute the First Suit  \n 26.

Such \nextended inaction is tantamount to an intention not to pursue the case at all. Texas courts have found that when a first -filing party show s no real intent to prosecute their case, a \nsecond case can proceed notwithstanding the first -filed rule. See, e.g., Wyatt , 760 S.W.2d \nat 248 (recognizing lack of intent to prosecute as an exception) . \n 27.

When an attorney fails to appea r or fails to carry this burden, \nthe court \u201cshall\u201d strike the attorney\u2019s pleadings and bar her from representing the client in that case. In TransAmerica Corp. v. Braes Woods Condo Ass\u2019n, for example, a verified motion to show authority was granted when a question arose about a corporation\u2019s \ncapacity; the trial court dismissed the attorney and struck the pleadings filed without \nproper authority.  \n34. Here, Ms. Carter\u2019s complete absence and unavailability strongly suggest she \nmay not have her client\u2019s authorization or active direction. It is even conceivable that \nPetitioner herself has not been kept apprised by Ms. Carter, given the lack of communicatio n. Respondent requests that the Court require Ms. Carter to promptly \nprove her authority. If she fails, the Court should strike any consolidation motion or other pleadings she filed and preclude her from further advocacy in this matter. The practical effect would render Petitioner unrepresented \u2013 a status Petitioner is effectively in already, due to Ms. Carter\u2019s dereliction. While Respondent takes no pleasure in Petitioner potentially losing counsel, the integrity of the proceedings demands that only duly authorized representatives be allowed to act.  \nB.

      "text": "17 \n 35. Ms. Carter\u2019s neglect of discovery \u2013 particularly her failure to answer Requests \nfor Admissions \u2013 has materially harmed the truth -finding process. By operation of Rule \n198, Petitioner is deemed to have admitted every fact in the Request for Admissions that \nwas unanswered. These deemed admissions are dispositive of key issues. Ms. Carter\u2019s failure to perform the most basic task of responding to discovery is a violation of her duties under Tex. R. Civ. P. 193.2 and 193.5 (to timely amend or respond) and ha s \nprejudiced her own client\u2019s case. In fact, her inaction practically concedes Respondent\u2019s claims and allegations. The Court should treat the deemed admissions as conclusively established in considering this Objection and the underlying merits \u2013 meaning t hat, for \npurposes of this objection, Petitioner has admitted the truth of the allegations in Section I , \nand can be admitted as summary judgement evidence, which remains un- opposed and sits \nas the oldest filed motion on this court\u2019s docket. (Filed and Serve d February 22, 2024). \nFurthermore, the Court should impose sanctions under Tex. R. Civ. P. 215 for the discovery abuse, although Respondent\u2019s primary goal is not monetary sanctions but to ensure the facts are recognized as admitted due to Ms. Carter\u2019s failure.  \nC. Abuse of Process  \n36. Ms. Carter\u2019s sudden filing of a Motion to Consolidate after a year of \ndormancy appears to be a textbook example of using legal process for delay and to burden an opponent, rather than for a legitimate purpose. Rule 13 of the Texas Rules of Civil Proced ure forbids filings that are groundless and brought in bad faith or to harass. \nLikewise, Rule 3.02 of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct states that a lawyer \u201cshall not take a position that unreasonably increases the costs or other burdens of the case or that unreasonably delays resolution of the matter.\u201d By her own inaction, Ms.",

There was no substantive justification given for consolidation \u2013 no claim that \nresources would be saved or justice served \u2013 only a tactic to avoid an immediate hearing. This conduct comes perilously close to violating Rule 13\u2019s prohibitions on bad- faith \npleadings and warrants the Court\u2019s scrutiny. Respondent respectfully submits that the \nCourt should consider sanctioning Petitioner\u2019s counsel  for this behavior, which has had \nthe effect of prolonging the children\u2019s exposure to harm and multiplying litigat ion for no \ngood reason. Sanctions could include an award of fees and expenses to Respondent \n(though pro se, Respondent has expended considerable time and resources), or fines payable to the Court, or any order deemed just to deter such tactics. At the very least, the lack of any substantive merit in the consolidation request should prompt the Court to deny it summarily.  \n38. In fact, the consolidation motion will likely resemble something similar to \nExhibit 1, the only attached exhibit in this document, as all claims and exhibits supporting these allegations have been in the possession of the opposing party for several months without any objection, communication, or argument against them. The exhibit resembles a cookie -cutter motion that provides no substance into the core issues of the case.  \n39. Lastly, Respondent notes that because Petitioner\u2019s counsel has not filed any \nsubstantive answer or response  to the merits of Respondent\u2019s claims in over a year, the \nCourt is effectively presented with a one -sided record of harm to the children.

Respondent urges that any procedural disputes be resolved forthwith so that the focus can return to the children. Or better yet, end this nightmare immediately by declaring the current orders void, which resolves the entire suit in favor of the children, and causes no harm to the Petitioner.  \n40. Petitioner, having failed to rebut any allegations, should not be permitted \nfurther delay. This Court has the power to prevent further injustice and harm by swiftly granting the un- opposed relief sought by the Respondent which should have been granted \non March 28, 2025. Every additional day of inaction is a day of potential damage to the \nchildren\u2019s psyche and development. Respondent respectfully asks the Court to remember \nthat the paramount concern is the children\u2019s best interests and their right to a s afe, stable \nhome \u2013 a right which has been denied to them for too long during these procedural \nwranglings. \nV . PRAYER FOR RELIEF  \nWHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED,  Respondent Charles Dustin \nMyers  prays that the Court grant the following relief for the reasons set forth above:  \ni.
