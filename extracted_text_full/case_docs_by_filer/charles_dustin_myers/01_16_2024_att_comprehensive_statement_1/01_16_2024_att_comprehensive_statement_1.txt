CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS,  
Defendant.  
 
COUNTER -PETITION FOR DIVORCE AND COMPREHENSIVE STATEMENT OF CONTEXT  
 
TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT:  
 
I, Charles Dustin Myers, the Defendant in the above -captioned case, submit this Counter -Petition for 
Divorce and Comprehensive Statement of Context in response to the Original Petition for Divorce filed by 
Morgan Michelle Myers, the Plaintiff. This documen t addresses the inaccuracies in the Plaintiff's petition, 
provides a detailed account of the situation, and outlines the evidence I am prepared to present to the 
Court.  
 
I. OVERVIEW AND CONTEXT  
 
This divorce is intertwined with two additional legal proceedings - an eviction suit (Case No. JP01 -23-
E00102017) and a protective order (Case No. 322 -744538 -23), both of which are deeply entangled with 
the divorce case (Case No. 322 -744263 -23).

The significant third -party influence exerted by individuals named Debbie, Damen, and Dan , as well as 
our landlord – her Grandmother – who lives next door to us - has critically impacted the Plaintiff's 
decisions and actions in our marital matters and the ongoing divorce proceedings. Notably, Dan 
Branthoover, a family member, has played an active and concerning role in the process  – claiming to be 
her legal representative yet possessing no license to practice law in the state of Texas.  
 
1. Debbie and Damen's Influence:  
I possess extensive text and call logs that unequivocally demonstrate the Plaintiff's prioritization 
of Debbie and Damen over our family obligations and commitments. These interactions, which 
have been meticulously logged and analyzed, reveal a consistent pattern where the Plaintiff has 
chosen to allocate a significant amount of her time an d attention to these individuals, even 
amidst our divorce proceedings.  It wasn’ t until the dis covery and subsequent discussion of these 
interactions that lead to the situation escalating. It is my fir m belief that the protective order was 
filed in an att empt to escape responsibility  rather than to seek protection, as we have been co -
habiting th roughout this process, and joint conservatorship was requested on the original 
divorce petition . 
2. Dan Branthoover's Role:  
Dan Branthoover's involvement has escalated beyond mere influence to active participation in 
the legal aspects of our divorce. He has notably assisted the Plaintiff in preparing and filing 
divorce papers.  
Critically, under Dan's advice, the Plaintiff withdrew $1,600 from our joint bank account without 
my authorization. This unauthorized transaction led to a dire financial situation, with a deficit of 
$800 in our account, resulting in bounced bills and consi derable strain on my business 
operations.  
This act of financial maneuvering, advised and facilitated by Dan, not only infringed upon our 
mutual financial responsibilities but also breached the trust inherent in our joint financial 
management. It underscores the extent of third -party involvement in  our personal and legal 
affairs.  
 
3. Communication Breakdown:  
Throughout these developments, the Plaintiff has consistently failed to communicate with me 
about these significant third -party influences and their implications on our divorce and family 
dynamics. This lack of communication has been a major contributing f actor to the 
misunderstandings and the subsequent escalation of conflict between us.  
The involvement of these third parties, particularly the actions taken by Dan Branthoover, have 
not only influenced the Plaintiff’s decisions but also actively interfered with our joint financial 
integrity and the legal process. This has added layers of co mplexity to an already challenging 
situation and has necessitated the presentation of this comprehensive account in the interest of 
transparency and fairness in these proceedings.  M.170 M.170

4.  Deterioration of Parental Responsibility  
Since the announcement of our divorce on December 1st, 2023, there has been a noticeable and 
concerning shift in Morgan’s parenting responsibilities and her involvement in our children’s 
lives. Prior to this date, Morgan was an engaged and active parent. H owever, since the 
announcement, her day -to-day interactions with Mara and Caroline have noticeably 
deteriorated. This change is not only alarming but also detrimental to the well -being and 
emotional stability of our children.  
Morgan has increasingly prioritized her personal interests, specifically her interactions with 
friends, Debbie,  and Damen, over her responsibilities as a mother. It has been observed and 
documented that she spends an excessive amount of time, estimated to be up to 24 hours per 
week, visiting these friends. This extensive time spent away from home has not only reduc ed her 
physical presence in our children's lives but also impacted her emotional availability to them.  
More concerning is the complete lack of effort on Morgan's part to communicate effectively 
about the children’s needs, their daily routines, and their emotional well -being since the divorce 
announcement. This breakdown in communication is critical, as co -parenting effectively is 
paramount for the children's adjustment to the changes in our family structure. The inability or 
unwillingness to engage in meaningful dialogue regarding our children’s care is not in their best 
interest and is counterproductive to their needs during this challenging time.  
5. Contradicting  and False Statements  
 
Throughout  the ongoing divorce proceedings, there have been several instances of contradictory  
and demonstrably false statements made by Morgan, which have significantly complicated and 
distorted the case. A critical point of contention is Morgan's claim regarding her inability to pay, 
which is incongruent with the financial facts presented. Additi onally, her request for the waiver 
of the standard 60 -day waiting period for divorce, citing an alleged order that found I had 
committed family violence, is entirely baseless and untrue.  
 
There is no evidence or record to substantiate claims of family violence in our marriage. In fact, 
this assertion directly contradicts my clean record and consistent history of being a caring and 
non-violent partner and father. The accusation appears to be  a strategic move to gain an unfair 
advantage in the divorce proceedings.  
 
Furthermore, Morgan's actions in filing a protective order, followed by the initiation of an 
eviction process, appear to be coordinated attempts to remove me from our family home. 
Notably, the eviction notice cited the protective order as a reason, even though  the protective 
order had not been filed at the time of the eviction notice. This sequence of events points 
towards a premeditated strategy to unfairly influence the custody and property aspects of our 
divorce.  
 
Given these concerning developments, it is imperative  that this counter petition replace the 
original . This counter -petition is not just a necessary step to address the false allegations and M.171 M.171
M.171 M.171 M.171 M.171

contradicting statements made by Morgan, but also a crucial measure to ensure a fair and 
equitable trial , and t o correct the inaccuracies made by Morgan on the original petition.  It is 
essential to have the appropriate amount of time and a factual basis for the proceedings to 
ensure that any decisions made, particularly those affecting our children’s future and well -being, 
are based on truth and justice, rather than unfounded alle gations. This approach will also 
facilitate a smoother and more amicable transition for all parties involved, especially for our 
children, who are of utmost importance in this process.  
 
II. EVIDENCE TO BE PRESENTED  
 
1. Text Message Evidence:  
 I will present text interactions between myself and the Plaintiff that show my attempts to work 
towards a resolution and her avoidance of communication and accountability.  
 
2. Data Analysis and Phone/Text Logs:  
 
I have prepared charts and graphs created from our joint account's text and phone call logs. 
These will illustrate the extreme levels of interaction the Plaintiff had with Debbie and Damen, 
highlighting her priorities outside of our marriage.  This priority in her fr iends has remained 
consistent - even throughout the divorce proceedings . 
 
3. No History of Family Violence:  
 I will present my criminal record from the Texas Department of Public Safety, proving the 
absence of any history of family violence . 
 
4. Bank Statements and Financial Transactions:  
Evidence of bank transactions will demonstrate financial maneuverings by the Plaintiff, advised 
by Dan Branthoover, affecting our joint account.  
 
5. Eviction Notice and Protective Order Claims:  
 
 I have the eviction notice served to me, which was later voided, and evidence related to the 
protective order, demonstrating the misuse of legal processes to influence our divorce and 
custody proceedings.

III. CHILDREN'S WELFARE AND FAMILY STABILITY  
 
The children's welfare remains my primary concern. The Plaintiff's actions, influenced by third parties 
and her unfounded claims, threaten our children's stability and well -being. I advocate for maintaining 
the standard 60 -day waiting period for the divorc e to provide our children with a stable and gradual 
transition.  
 
Since the divorce announcement, I have remaine d an active role in my children ’s lives, finding activities 
for us to do together due to their time off from school. Desp ite all inclusion efforts – Morgan has 
declined to join us on these ac tivities  – something the children  don’t understand  and have taken notice 
to. Morg an, on the other hand, has been extremely short with the children, impatient, and has kept her 
priorities in line with her friends . 
 
 
 
IV. PROPOSAL FOR INTER IM CUSTODY ARRANGEMENT   
Considering  the current complexities surrounding our divorce proceedings, and with the paramount goal 
of ensuring the best interests and minimal disruption to our children’s lives, I propose the following 
interim custody arrangement:  
1. Full Custody Arrangement  
I propose to take on full custody of our children, Mara and Caroline. This decision is motivated by the 
need to provide them with a stable and consistent environment, especially during this transitional 
phase of our family's life. My commitment to their da y-to-day needs, emotional well -being, and 
continued growth has been and will remain unwavering.  
2. Co-Habitation in Current Family Home:  
Recognizing the importance of maintaining a sense of normalcy for our children, I suggest that we 
continue to cohabit in our current family home. This arrangement will prevent any immediate 
upheaval in the children's living environment, allowing them to re tain their sense of security and 
familiarity amidst the ongoing changes , and will afford Morgan the opportunity to find full -time 
stable employ ment, and allow me to continue making rent payments to her grandmother, our 
landlord. This is in the best interest of all parties involved.  
3. Transition to a New Home  
 I am planning to move out of my current family home with the children, but only when a suitable 
and equally accommodating residence is secured. The aim is to ensure this new home is near  our M.173 M.173
M.173 M.173 M.173 M.173

current location, thus allowing the children to remain in their current school and maintain their 
usual routines and social connections.  
4. Active Roles for Both Parents  
 It is imperative that both Morgan and I continue to play active roles in our children's lives. The 
proposed arrangement is designed to facilitate this by ensuring that the children have regular and 
consistent access to both parents. This continued parental  presence will be crucial in minimizing the 
emotional and psychological impact of our separation on Mara and Caroline.  
 
Mitigating Potential Damage: The current petition, as it stands, poses a significant risk of causing 
disruption and potential harm to our children's well-being.  
by abruptly altering their living situation and limiting their access to one parent. My proposal aims to 
mitigate this damage by providing a more balanced and thoughtful approach to the transition, one 
that prioritizes the emotional and psychological healt h of our children above all else.  
Flexibility and Cooperation: This proposal is made with a spirit of flexibility and cooperation, 
understanding that the situation may evolve as we navigate this process. I am open to discussions 
and modifications to this plan, if they serve the best interests of Mara and Caroline.  
Professional Support if Needed: To aid in this transition and to ensure that the emotional needs of 
our children are being met, I also propose that we engage the services of a child psychologist or a 
family counselor. This professional can provide support to Mara and Caroline, helping them to 
understand and adapt to the changes in their family dynamics.  
Regular Review and Adjustment of the Arrangement: I propose that this interim custody 
arrangement be subject to regular review, with the possibility of adjustments based on the evolving 
needs of our children and our family situation. This will ensure that the arrangement remains 
relevant and beneficial for Mara and Caroline.  
 
V. PRAYER  
 
WHEREFORE, premises considered, I respectfully request that the Court consider this Counter -Petition 
for Divorce with due diligence. My earnest prayer is for a fair and just resolution that corrects the 
inaccuracies in the original petition and uncovers th e true nature of the events leading to the divorce 
announcement. It is vital that these matters are resolved amicably, prioritizing the best interests of our 
children, Mara,  and Caroline. I seek a fair outcome that recognizes the complexities of our situation and 
promotes a stable, nurturing environment for our family moving forward.  
Respectfully submitted,
