judge. The statute clearly differentiates between the local administrative judge 
and each district or statutory county court judge, granting them separate 
authority to establish court coordinator systems and appoint court coordinators who serve at the pleasure of their respective appointing judges.  
      The statute specifically states that "the local administrative judge and each 
district or statutory county court judge" may establish a court coordinator 
system and appoint a court coordinator for their court. This language places the 
local administrative judge and other judges on equal footing with respect to 
coordinator appointments, with each having independent authority to appoint 
coordinators for their own courts. Furthermore, subsection (b) establishes that "each court coordinator serves at the pleasure of the judge who appointed him," 
creating a direct reporting relationship between the coordinator and their specific appointing judge.  
      The distinction between a court coordinator assigned by a district judge and 
the administrative judge is further supported by the broader statutory context. 
Texas Government Code Sec. 75.401, while addressing court administrator systems rather than court c oordinators specifically, reinforces the concept of 
separate judicial roles in court administration. This complementary provision shows that Texas law establishes different administrative functions within the 
court system, with court administrators coopera ting with various judges,

including "regional, presiding, and local administrative judges." This 
cooperative relationship would be unnecessary if the court coordinator positions 
were not distinct from administrative judges.  While Section 75.401 addresses 
court administrators rather than court coordinators directly, it provides valuable context for understanding the relationships between different judicial roles and 
court administrative staff in the Texas court system.  
        I n this instance, the Respondent objected to the court coordinator handling 
the recusal proceedings who was appointed by the same District Judge  subject 
to the recusal  when the statute set for th in the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 
specifically designates duties to the clerk of th e court, not the coordinator . 
II. ANALYSIS  
      In the order overruling the objection, it was stated that “ [t]he court 
coordinators and clerks work together to assist the trial court judges and the 
administrative judges. Only the judges, not the litigants, have the autho rity to 
direct the activities of the cou rt coordinators and clerks. ” Here, the court 
misapplied the rule. As stated above, 75.401(b) of the code expressly states that 
“[e]ach court coordinator serves at the pleasure of the judge who appointed 
him.” Because the court coordinator in question was appointed by the 
Honorable Judge subject to recusal and based on the analysis of Texas

Government Code Sec. 74.101 and the supplementary context provided by 
Section 75.401, the provision that a court coordinator serves at the pleasure of 
the appointing judge strongly implies that a coordinator assigned by a district 
judge is distinct from th e administrative judge. This conclusion is supported by 
multiple aspects of the statutory language: 
1. The statute separately identifies "the local administrative judge and each 
district or statutory county court judge" as authorities who may establish 
court coordinator systems and appoint court coordinators.  
2. Each judge may appoint a coordinator specifically "for his court," suggesting 
a one -to-one relationship between judges and the coordinators for their 
courts.  
3. Each court coordinator "serves at the pleasure of the judge who appointed him," creating a direct accountability relationship between the coordinator and the specific appointing judge.  
4. The complementary provisions regarding court administrators explicitly 
distinguish between administrative judges and the courts served by 
administrators, requiring cooperation between them.  
    If court coordinators were not distinct from administrative judges, it would 
create potential conflicts in prioritization and resource allocation. A coordinator

simultaneously answerable to both a district judge and an administrative judge 
might face competing demands, undermining the efficiency the system is designed 
to promote.  
    Furthermore, the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure governing recusal are 
unambiguous, and designate no responsibilities  regarding recusal proce edings to be 
handled by the coordinator. See Id . 18a(e) (specifically designating duties to the 
clerk of the court) By permitting the involvement of the coordinator in the recusal 
proceedings when that coordinator was appointed by the district judge  subject to 
recusal w ould be prejudicial . 
     Finally, regarding the reference to Judge Kaitcer in these proceedings, the order 
is also prejudicial –  because no such motion was ever filed implicating Honorable 
Jeff Kaitcer in the current proceedings. To overrule th is objection but permit the 
assigned judge to consider that issue on a motion not before the court would cause 
further delay, waste judicial resources, and effectuate the exact opposite purpose of 
the statute invoked and used to overrule the objection. (74.102(b)) By permitting 
the coordinator to ‘work together ’ with the clerks would exceed the statutory 
authority set forth in the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.

III. CONCLUSION  
      In conclusion, the legal framework governing recusal motions in Texas courts 
requires the use of clerks, not coordinators, for handling these matters. 
Administrative judges must comply with these requirements and cannot substitute 
coordinators for clerks i n the recusal process.   To obtain relief through a writ of 
mandamus, the relator must establish that (1) the act he seeks to compel is ministerial, rather than discretionary, in nature and (2) no other adequate remedy at law is available. Engle v. Coker, 820 S.W.2d 247 (Tex. App. —Beaumont 1991, no 
pet.). An act is ministerial if it constitutes a duty clearly fixed and required by law, without the exercise of discretion or judgment.  Here, the act of following the Texas 
Rules of Civil Procedure regarding the re cusal process is ministerial, and 
mandamus is the app ropriate remedy to challenge the Ma y 15, 2025,  order 
overruling the Respondent ’s objection for the reasons state d. The use of a 
coordinator instead o f the statutory required clerk is a failure to perform a 
ministerial duty. As explained in  In re Norman, 191 S.W.3d 858 (Tex. App. 2006), 
mandamus relief may be available when a judge fails to follow mandatory 
procedural requirements related to recusal moti ons.

322ND JUDICIAL DISTRICT 
TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
ORDER DENYING OBJECTION TO ORDER OF ASSIGNMENT DATED MAY 6, 2025 
AND THE OBJECTION DATED APRIL 29, 2025 
Came on to be considered the Objection to Order of Assignment Dated May 6, 2025, and 
the Objection dated April 29, 2025 that were filed Charles Dustin Myers in the above-entitled 
cause. 
Mr. Myers complains of the court coordinator's involvement in the recusal process. A 
Court Coordinator's duties include assisting the administrative judges. See Tex. Gov't Code Ann. 
§ 74.102(b) which provides as follows: 
To promote uniform and efficient administration of justice in this state, the court 
coordinators shall cooperate with regional presiding and local administrative 
judges and state agencies having duties in the area of the operation of the courts. 
The court coordinators and clerks work together to assist the trial judges and the 
administrative judges. Only the judges, not the litigants, have the authority to direct the activities 
of the court coordinators and clerks. Mr. Myers' objections regarding the involvement are 
overruled. 
Mr. Myers also objects to the referral by Judge Kaitcer of a motion to recuse (Kaitcer 
recusal motion) to the undersigned. This objection is overruled. However, the judge who hears
