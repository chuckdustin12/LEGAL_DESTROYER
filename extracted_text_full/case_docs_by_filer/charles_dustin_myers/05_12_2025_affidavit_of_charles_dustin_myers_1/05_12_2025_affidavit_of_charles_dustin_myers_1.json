On \none hand, she requested joint managing conservatorship ( R. 51 \nat a-2), while simultaneously asserting that she had filed for an \nemergency protective order  on December 14, 2023 ( R. 54 at \n9B). In that same filing, she claimed that a protective order was \nalready in effect and that it included a judicial finding of family violence  committed by me during the marriage (R. 54 at 10)\u2014 a \nserious allegation that has never been substantiated by evidence, hearing, or court order.  \n4. In that same initial pleading, Morgan declared both family vehicles \nas her separate property ( R. 55 at 11B ). \n5. She further alleged that she would be abused or harassed if I were \ngranted access to her contact information, a claim that directly contradicts her stated request for joint managing conservatorship, which necessarily requires regular and \ncooperative communication between both parents for decision-\nmaking related to the children.

      "text": "CONCLUSION  \n In sum, I have maintained respect for the tribunal below and for all \nparties involved. But what has occurred in this case is egregious, damaging, \nand unredressed . For over fourteen months , I have sought clarity as to how \na situation this self -evidently flawed could persist without correction\u2014\nunopposed, undisputed, and unadjudicated. A failure of this magnitude \nshould never occur, especially when the record shows silence from the party \nthat obtained everything and accountability from the one left with nothing. \nBased on the totality of the record and my direct experience, I solemnly affirm the following to be true and/or believe them to be true under penalty \nof perjury:  \n1.\u2009I believe  I was denied a meaningful forum to assert my rights from \nthe outset. From day one , I was placed at a significant disadvantage, \nstripped of my home, children, and livelihood , and every proceeding \nthereafter was procedurally imbalanced.  \n2.\u2009I believe  Morgan\u2019s pleadings were so materially deceptive  and \nfundamentally fraudulent  that they created a prejudicial narrative that \nforeclosed any fair opportunity for me to respond or defend myself.

There has been no substantive litigation effort or \nevidentiary advancement, and the silence is conspicuous. It is also highly suspect that a party who declared financial indigency could \nimmediately retain counsel  upon being compelled to substantiate her \nclaims.  \n5.\u2009I know  that I have never been granted a fair or complete opportunity \nto present evidence refuting Morgan\u2019s claims or to fully defend myself \non the record.  \n6.\u2009I know  that Morgan has not supported any meaningful co- parenting \nrelationship. I routinely go weeks without contact  with my children\u2014\nincluding on major holidays and birthdays\u2014despite our previously \nclose and daily bond.  \n7.\u2009I know  that Morgan routinely leaves the children in the care of \nrelatives during the day, depriving them of both parental presences they once had under one roof.
