For the preceding twelve months and fourteen days, Petitioner has been unlawfully  \nBarred from entering his residence and has been cut out of his children\u2019s lives . On March 6th,  \n2024, while walking M.E.M and C.R.M. to school, Respondent unlawfully locked the Petitioner \nout of the matrimonial home and called the Watauga police depar tment who came to assist in the \ndispute. When on scene a t 6641 Anne Court, Watauga , Texas 76148, Respondent produced an \nagreed associate judge\u2019s report where consent had been withdrawn and use d it a s a means to bar \nthe Petitioner \u2019s entry to the home. With a n emergency hearing date set for March 14th, 2024, the \nPetitioner took the advice of the officers and stayed with his father temporarily in Flower \nMound, Texas  to avoid unnecessary  conflict.   \n 2.

The orders in question, attached hereto as EXHIBIT 1 , are facially void and lack legal \neffect. Despite this, they continue to cause ongoing and irreparable harm, as further detailed \nbelow. Accordingly, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court issue a declaratory judgment formally recognizing the invalidity of these orders whi ch will simultaneously provide long-\noverdue relief to the children in this matter . In support of this request, the Petitioner  shows as \nfollows:  \nI. STATEMENT OF FACTS  \n 4. On page 1 of the orders, they  read  as follows:  \u201cThe parties have agreed to the terms of \nthis order as evidenced by the signatures below .\u201d \n 5. On the final page of the orders, the signatures of CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS and his \nprevious attorney, DAN BACALIS, are not present on the document. \n 6. The Petitioner refused to sign the orders to which he did not consent to on March 14\nth, \n2024.  7. The orders were rendered on March 26\nth, 2024, as an agreement between the parties \ndespite consent not being present at the time of rendition . \n 8. The order s are void ab initio and  have no legal effect.  \nII. ARGUMENT  \nA. An \u201cAgreed\u201d Order Without Actual Consent is Void Ab Initio  \n9. Texas law is unequivocal that a judgment purporting to rest on an agreement of the \nparties cannot be rendered or enforced if one of the parties did not genuinely consent at the time of rendition.

As the Texas Supreme Court has stated, a trial court cannot render a valid \nagreed judgment absent the consent of the parties at the time it is rendered , and the  \nagreement can be revoked at any time before judgment is rendered on the agreement.  S & A \nRestaurant Corp. v. Leal , 892 S.W.2d 855, 857 (Tex.1995). This is so because a trial court cannot \nrender a valid agreed judgment absent the consent of the parties at the time it is rendered. Padilla \nv. LaFrance , 907 S.W.2d 454, 461 (Tex.1995).  \n10. In S&A Restaurant Corp. v. Leal , the Court reaffirmed that a party may revoke \nconsent to a settlement at any time before judgment is rendered, and if a court nonetheless signs a judgment after consent has been revoked, \u201ca judgment rendered after one party revokes his \nconsent is void .\u201d This rule reflects a fundamental principle: t rue consent  is the linchpin of any \nagreed order.  \n11. Here, Petitioner never consented to the order  at the time they were entered. Indeed, \nhis missing signature is a prima facie showing of this fact.  Under these circumstances, it was \nerror for the Court to sign the order as an \u201cagreed\u201d judgment , and the result is that the order \nis void ab initio. The Texas Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Quintero v. Jim Walter Homes, Inc., 654 S.W.2d 442 (Tex. 1983) is directly on point. In Quintero, the Court held that when a trial court has knowledge that one party does not consent to a judgment, the court \u201cshould refuse to sanction [the] agreement by making it the judgment of the court.\u201d  Id. By entering an order in \nthe absence of Petitioner\u2019s consent, the agreed judgment in this case was not just voidable \u2014it is \nabsolutely void from inception . In legal effect, there never was a valid temporary order at all, \nbecause the requisite meeting of the minds was absent. \n12. Texas courts of appeals have applied these principles in situations analogous to \nPetitioner\u2019s, particularly in family law cases. For example, in In re E.B. , No. 12- 17-00214- CV",

      "text": "4 \n (Tex. App.\u2014Tyler Oct. 18, 2017) , the trial court had entered temporary orders incorporating a \nRule 11 settlement agreement regarding conservatorship and possession of children. The father, \nhowever, had timely revoked his consent to that agreement. The Tyler Court of Appeals held that because the father withdrew consent before judgment, the agreed terms regarding \nconservatorship and possession were void . The appellate court unequivocally stated that the \nprovisions of the temporary orders involving the children \u201c are void, and the trial court abused \nits discretion in entering temporary orders based on the [purported] Agreement .\u201d The court \nconditionally granted mandamus and directed the trial judge to vacate those portions of the temporary order .  \nB. A Void Judgment is a Nullity and Can Be Challenged or Vacated at Any Time  \n13. Because the temporary orders were entered without jurisdiction (i.e. without consent \njurisdiction conferred by the parties\u2019 agreement), the resulting \u201cagreed\u201d order is void. Under Texas law, a void judgment or order has no legal force or effect from the ou tset. It is \u201cnull\u201d  ab \ninitio, and any person or court affected by it is entitled to treat it as a nullity . The Texas Supreme \nCourt has explained that a void order is, in effect, no order at all: \u201c[A] void judgment is a legal \nnullity . . . .\u201d  Alanis v. Barclays Capital Real Estate Inc., No. 04 -17-00069- CV (Tex. App. Mar. \n27, 2017) .  \n14. Such a judgment may be collaterally attacked and set aside at any time, as it is not \nsubject to ordinary procedural bars. Browning v. Placke , 698 S.W.2d 362 (Tex. 1985) (per \ncuriam), is instructive on this point. In Browning, the Supreme Court recognized that courts of equal jurisdiction have the authority to declare a judgment void when it suffers from a fundamental defect (such as lack of jurisdiction or lack of consent) . Here, this is a direct fit with \nthe present situation.",
