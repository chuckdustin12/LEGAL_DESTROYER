 NO. 322-744263-23 
IN THE 322ND DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY , TEXAS 
 
 
To the Honorable Judge of the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County: 
I. THE LAW  
There is a general presumption that an attorney is acting with authority; 
however, that presumption is rebuttable. Breceda v. Whi, 187 S.W.3d 148, 152 
(Tex. App. --El Paso 2006, no pet.); Kelly v. Murphy, 630 S.W.2d 759, 761 
(Tex. App. --Houston [1st Dist.] 1982, writ ref'd n.r.e.); see also City of San 
Antonio v. Aguilar, 670 S.W.2d 681, 684 (Tex. App. --San Antonio 1984, writ 
dism'd) ("[A]n attorney who has conducted a case in the trial court is 
presumed to have authority to pursue an appeal, although this presumption can 
be rebutted.").  Here, however, this presumption is to be rebutted for the 
foregoing reasons:  
 Morgan Michelle Myers,   
  
  
Petitioner,   
  
v. Respondent ’s Rule 12 Motion to Show 
Authority

 I. Legal Basis for Rule 12 Motion  
2. Pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. § 12, a party may challenge an attorney’s 
authority to act on behalf of a party in a proceeding.  When such a challenge is 
raised, the burden of proof shifts to the challenged attorney to demonstrate 
their authority to represent the party.  Id. The attorney must appear before the 
trial court and show sufficient authority to prosecute or defend the suit on 
behalf of their client. (Breceda v. Whi (2006) 187 S.W.3d 148, 152; Kelly v. 
Murphy (1982) 630 S.W.2d 759, 761).  
3. Rule 12 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure permits any party to 
challenge an attorney’s authority to prosecute or defend a lawsuit. (See Nolana 
Open MRI Ctr.,  Inc. v. Pechero (2015) No. 13- 13-00552-CV , at *15). The 
purpose of a Rule 12 motion is to protect parties from groundless suits and to 
permit dismissal of suits instituted without authority. (See Nicholas v. Envtl. Sys. (Int’l) Ltd.  (2016) 499 S.W.3d 888, 895; Angelina Cty. v. McFarland 
(1964) 374 S.W.2d 417, 422–23).  
  4. Here, the procedural inconsistencies, lack of formal notice, and 
submission of documents by other parties on behalf of Ms. raise substantial 
doubts about whether she possesses the necessary authority to represent the 
Petitioner.  Despite being allegedly retained on January 22, 2024, Ms. Carter 
has not filed a formal notice of appearance, leaving her role ambiguous. Further complicating matters, filings under her name have been submitted by 
others, including the founder of Marx Altman & Johnson, her purported 
former employer.  Coupled with her suspiciously timed State Bar profile 
update and lack of meaningful engagement, these facts compel the Respondent to seek clarification and challenge her authority under Rule 12.

 II. Procedural Basis 
 5. No Formal Notice of Appearance Filed.  Although Cooper Carter 
was allegedly retained on January 22, 2024 , she has not filed a formal Notice 
of Appearance in this case. The absence of a Notice of Appearance creates 
substantial ambiguity regarding her authority to represent the Petitioner, 
especially given the procedural irregularities discussed below.   
  6. Lack of engagement.  Throughout the proceedings, Ms. Carter 
has cons istently failed to engage in any meaning ful way  and has failed 
to respond to any pleadings  in the suit.  
  7. Filings Submitted on Behalf of Cooper Carter . All court 
documents and pleadings attributed to Ms. Carter have been submitted "on her 
behalf" by Roderick Marx , the founder of Marx Altman & Johnson . There 
is no indication that Ms. Carter  is directly involved in this matter, raising 
significant questions about whether she is properly authorized to act as 
counsel for Morgan Michelle Myers.  
    8. Discrepan cies in employment.  On Ms. Carter ’s public social 
media, she claims to be a former attorney for Marx Altman & Johnson and claims to be employed currently with Cantey Hanger LLP.

 themselves.2 Further, Every attorney in Texas is required by law to maintain a 
current and up-to-date profile. Tex. Gov’ t Code § 81.115. Notably, Ms. 
Carter ’s profile was updated on March 13th, 2024, one day prior to the only 
hearing that has occurred in this matter3 to her former employer . The 
Respondent has actively been seeking relief from the result of the 
aforementioned hearing for nearly seven months without any engagement or 
any authoritative activity from Ms. Carter , thus warranting this motion.  
III. Prayer and Relief  
9. Given the ongoing procedural irregularities and the apparent lack of 
clarity surrounding Cooper Carter’s authority to represent Petitioner Morgan 
Myers , the Respondent respectfully requests the following: 
i.  The Court should schedule a hearing requiring Cooper Carter to 
personally appear and definitively prove her authority to represent 
Morgan Myers , and to provide clarification as to who is involved in 
the case, and in what capacity Morgan Michelle Myers is being 
represented  in this matter.  
ii.  "Upon [her] failure to show such authority, the court shall refuse 
to permit the attorney to appear in the cause, and shall strike the 
pleadings if no person who is authorized to prosecute or defend 
appears. " (Tex. R. Civ. P. 12; see Kindle v. Wood Cnty. Elec. Co-op, Inc.  
(2004) 151 S.W.3d 206, 210)

 iii.  Grant of Summary Judgment Motion: Given that the 
Respondent’s pending summary judgment motion filed on February 
26th, 2024,  remains unchallenged due to the lack of any meaningful 
engagement from Cooper Carter, and in light of the procedural 
deficiencies highlighted above, the Court should grant the pending 
summary judgment via the attached order as unopposed for judicial 
efficiency and to reset the status quo ante. 
iv.  Stay all other formal settings and proceedings until resolution of 
this motion.  
v.  Respondent seeks no further sanction s against Ms. Carter 
given she fails to show her authority over the Petitioner in this 
matter.
