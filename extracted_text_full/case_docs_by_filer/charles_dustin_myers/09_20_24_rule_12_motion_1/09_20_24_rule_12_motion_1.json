THE LAW  \nThere is a general presumption that an attorney is acting with authority; \nhowever, that presumption is rebuttable. Breceda v. Whi, 187 S.W.3d 148, 152 \n(Tex. App. --El Paso 2006, no pet.); Kelly v. Murphy, 630 S.W.2d 759, 761 \n(Tex. App. --Houston [1st Dist.] 1982, writ ref'd n.r.e.); see also City of San \nAntonio v. Aguilar, 670 S.W.2d 681, 684 (Tex. App. --San Antonio 1984, writ \ndism'd) (\"[A]n attorney who has conducted a case in the trial court is \npresumed to have authority to pursue an appeal, although this presumption can \nbe rebutted.\").  Here, however, this presumption is to be rebutted for the \nforegoing reasons:  \n Morgan Michelle Myers,   \n  \n  \nPetitioner,   \n  \nv.

      "text": "2 \n I. Legal Basis for Rule 12 Motion  \n2. Pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. \u00a7 12, a party may challenge an attorney\u2019s \nauthority to act on behalf of a party in a proceeding.  When such a challenge is \nraised, the burden of proof shifts to the challenged attorney to demonstrate \ntheir authority to represent the party.  Id. The attorney must appear before the \ntrial court and show sufficient authority to prosecute or defend the suit on \nbehalf of their client. (Breceda v. Whi (2006) 187 S.W.3d 148, 152; Kelly v. \nMurphy (1982) 630 S.W.2d 759, 761).  \n3. Rule 12 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure permits any party to \nchallenge an attorney\u2019s authority to prosecute or defend a lawsuit. (See Nolana \nOpen MRI Ctr.,  Inc. v. Pechero (2015) No. 13- 13-00552-CV , at *15). The \npurpose of a Rule 12 motion is to protect parties from groundless suits and to \npermit dismissal of suits instituted without authority. (See Nicholas v. Envtl. Sys. (Int\u2019l) Ltd.  (2016) 499 S.W.3d 888, 895; Angelina Cty. v. McFarland \n(1964) 374 S.W.2d 417, 422\u201323).  \n  4. Here, the procedural inconsistencies, lack of formal notice, and \nsubmission of documents by other parties on behalf of Ms. raise substantial \ndoubts about whether she possesses the necessary authority to represent the \nPetitioner.  Despite being allegedly retained on January 22, 2024, Ms. Carter \nhas not filed a formal notice of appearance, leaving her role ambiguous. Further complicating matters, filings under her name have been submitted by \nothers, including the founder of Marx Altman & Johnson, her purported \nformer employer.  Coupled with her suspiciously timed State Bar profile \nupdate and lack of meaningful engagement, these facts compel the Respondent to seek clarification and challenge her authority under Rule 12.",

      "text": "3 \n II. Procedural Basis \n 5. No Formal Notice of Appearance Filed.  Although Cooper Carter \nwas allegedly retained on January 22, 2024 , she has not filed a formal Notice \nof Appearance in this case. The absence of a Notice of Appearance creates \nsubstantial ambiguity regarding her authority to represent the Petitioner, \nespecially given the procedural irregularities discussed below.   \n  6. Lack of engagement.  Throughout the proceedings, Ms. Carter \nhas cons istently failed to engage in any meaning ful way  and has failed \nto respond to any pleadings  in the suit.  \n  7. Filings Submitted on Behalf of Cooper Carter . All court \ndocuments and pleadings attributed to Ms. Carter have been submitted \"on her \nbehalf\" by Roderick Marx , the founder of Marx Altman & Johnson . There \nis no indication that Ms. Carter  is directly involved in this matter, raising \nsignificant questions about whether she is properly authorized to act as \ncounsel for Morgan Michelle Myers.  \n    8. Discrepan cies in employment.  On Ms. Carter \u2019s public social \nmedia, she claims to be a former attorney for Marx Altman & Johnson and claims to be employed currently with Cantey Hanger LLP.\n1 The timeliness of \nher profile aligns with the public article releas ed by Cantey Hanger LLP \n \n1 Ms. Carter's public LinkedIn pro\ufb01le",

Notably, Ms. \nCarter \u2019s profile was updated on March 13th, 2024, one day prior to the only \nhearing that has occurred in this matter3 to her former employer . The \nRespondent has actively been seeking relief from the result of the \naforementioned hearing for nearly seven months without any engagement or \nany authoritative activity from Ms. Carter , thus warranting this motion.  \nIII. Prayer and Relief  \n9. Given the ongoing procedural irregularities and the apparent lack of \nclarity surrounding Cooper Carter\u2019s authority to represent Petitioner Morgan \nMyers , the Respondent respectfully requests the following: \ni.  The Court should schedule a hearing requiring Cooper Carter to \npersonally appear and definitively prove her authority to represent \nMorgan Myers , and to provide clarification as to who is involved in \nthe case, and in what capacity Morgan Michelle Myers is being \nrepresented  in this matter.  \nii.  \"Upon [her] failure to show such authority, the court shall refuse \nto permit the attorney to appear in the cause, and shall strike the \npleadings if no person who is authorized to prosecute or defend \nappears. \" (Tex. R. Civ. P. 12; see Kindle v. Wood Cnty. Elec. Co-op, Inc.  \n(2004) 151 S.W.3d 206, 210)  \n \n2 News article corroborating employment timeline  \n3 Ms. Carter \u2019s Texas State Bar pro\ufb01le .",

Grant of Summary Judgment Motion: Given that the \nRespondent\u2019s pending summary judgment motion filed on February \n26th, 2024,  remains unchallenged due to the lack of any meaningful \nengagement from Cooper Carter, and in light of the procedural \ndeficiencies highlighted above, the Court should grant the pending \nsummary judgment via the attached order as unopposed for judicial \nefficiency and to reset the status quo ante. \niv.
