THOMAS A. WILDER
DISTRICT CLERK

NO. 322 -744263 -23 
IN THE 322ND DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY , TEXAS  
OBJE CTION AND REQUEST 
TO DOCKET   
R
espondent  respectfully objects to the handling of the case documents regarding 
the joint motion to recuse filed on October 7th, 2024  for the foregoing reasons:  
I.FAILURE TO DOCKET
1.R
espondent’ s motion to recuse has not been docketed on the research Texas
platform. Metadata from the efile Texas platform shows the last docketed pleading to be 
the Respondent ’s Proposed Order on Rule 12  Motion  (id # 
7f9852d3f4205e0083d02b0536696131 ) See attache d Exhibit A. 
2.
The correspondence to Regional Judge David Evans from  District Judge  James
M
unford has not been docketed . 
3. The amended order of referral signed on October 9th, 2024 , by District Judge
James Munford  has not been docketed . IN THE MATTER  
OF THE MARRIAGE OF  
MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS  
AND CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS  
AND IN THE INTEREST OF MARA 
MYERS AND CAROLINE MYERS, 
CHILDREN

4. The correspondence  and order of referral  to Regional Judge David Evans from 
Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer signed October 10th, 2024, has not been docketed. 
II. RELEV ANT COURT RULES  
5. According to Rule 25  and Rule 26  of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, the 
clerk is required to maintain a file docket and a court docket that record all filings, 
motions, orders, and proceedings in a case. The failure to properly docket these 
documents violates these rules and further compromises the integrity of the case record. 
III. INCONSISTENT RESPONSES AND FAILURE TO FOLLOW PROTOCOL  
6. The Respondent was initially informed via email that the exhibits and affidavits  
had been filed. However, after the Respondent pointed out discrepancies in file size, the 
explanation changed to the document being too large. This inconsistency raises concerns 
about transparency and procedural fairness.  Exhibit B  
7. As outlined in the Tarrant County FAQ , Respondent's original submission of 20 
MB was well within the 36 MB limit, and the Respondent followed all proper e -filing 
procedures. Despite this, the filing was forwarded to the regional judge without the 
exhibits and affidavits and later split into t hree sections due to the supposed size limit —
yet the documents were never subsequently docketed.  
IV . THE ONLY RECEIPT CONTAINS THE INCORRECT PLEADNIGS

8. Despite the emails sent to the Respondent from th e court coordinator Lindsey 
Baker, there is no official receipt that the correct motion , as filed, was delivered to the 
regional judge  from either respondent.  
 9. The motion as originally filed was mo dified for reasons that  did not remain 
persistent. The reasoning given related to file size contradicts the FAQ from the Tarrant 
County District Clerk . If a separate system is used to forward these files to the Re gional 
Judge, the Respondent respectfully requests that this be clarified given the severity of the 
situation.  
CONCLU SION  AND  REQUEST 
Given the persistent inconsistencies, failure to properly docket the Respondent's 
filings, and the lack of transparency surrounding the handling of crucial case documents, 
Respondent Charles Dustin Myers  formally objects to the actions of the 322nd District 
Court and requests immediate correction of the docketing failures. Furthermore, 
Respondent requests validation that the correct motions and accompanying exhibits were 
forwarded to the regional judge  as originally filed . The files officially served to the 
Respondent via eFile  do not contain the original joint motion . In light of these ongoing 
procedural issues, Respondent reserves the right to seek further remedies unless proper 
procedural requirements are followed to ensure equal protection under the United States 
Constitution.

Dear Lindsay Baker,
I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you that my Motion to Recuse, referenced in your message, may
have been forwarded without the attached exhibits and affidavits that are critical to the motion.
The exhibits and affidavits provide necessary evidence and support for my claims, and it is important that the court has
access to the full record. Could you please confirm whether these documents were received with my motion? It raises
further concern that they are missing.
Please let me know the appropriate process to ensure that these documents are added to the court’s record. Thank you
for your attention to this matter.

I have attached a copy that was submitted and is available for download via the re-search T exas platform, which differs
from the document attached in your prior email as it does not contain the relevant exhibits.
Please inform as soon as possible.

Dear Ms. Baker,
Thank you for your response, and would just ask for some clarification on a couple of things.
There are noticable discrepancies between the file I submitted, accepted and available on the reSearchTX platform versus
what appears in the court's receipt to the Regional Judge. My original submission was 20.21 MB, while the version in the
courts email is 423 KB. Additionally, my receipt provides no indication that the exhibits were filed alongside the motion,
particularly the affidavit, which is referenced in the table of contents.
The document I submitted was also hyperlinked, but those links are missing in the court’s receipt.
Could you please clarify which court system the file is currently in and explain for what purpose the file was modified to
appear as if it were an unverified motion? 
I would appreciate your prompt attention to this matter at your earliest convenience.
Best regards,
Charles Myers
