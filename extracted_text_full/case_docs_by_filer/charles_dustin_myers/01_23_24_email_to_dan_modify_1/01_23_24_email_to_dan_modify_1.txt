MOTION TO MODIFY TEMPORARY ORDERS
Introduction
Charles Dustin Myers, herein referred to as the Petitioner, respectfully submits this motion to modify the temporary orders
issued in this case, concerning the custody of his children and his eviction from his residence. 
This motion is filed under the relevant sections of the Texas Family Code, including but not limited to Sections 156.001,
156.006, and 152.205.
Statement of Facts
The Petitioner was served with divorce papers on December 27, 2023, which contained several false claims and
allegations from Morgan Michelle Myers, who has abused the legal process, including but not limited to:
1. Falsifying a Statement of Inability to Pay
2. Lying on the divorce petition
3. Lying on the protective order.
4. Trying to have me unlawfully evicted.
Subsequently, on January 16, 2024, without a fair opportunity for the Petitioner to be heard due to inclement weather
leading to court closures, Judge Munford presided over the only open court and signed a temporary order removing the
Petitioner from his home and granting full temporary custody to Morgan Michelle Myers, herein referred to as the
Respondent.
This motion contends that these temporary orders were made without considering the Petitioner's rights to a fair hearing
as stipulated in Texas Family Code Section 152.205 and without substantial evidence to justify such drastic measures.
Legal Grounds for Modification
Violation of Right to Be Heard: 
The temporary orders were made without providing the Petitioner an adequate opportunity to be heard, in violation of
Texas Family Code Section 152.205.b.
Even after acquiring legal counsel, Morgan was granted another continuance after not holding up her end of the
agreement.
Best Interest of the Children: 
The temporary orders do not serve the best interest of the children, which is the paramount consideration in custody
decisions, as per Texas Family Code Section 153.002.c. 
Lack of Substantial Change in Circumstances: The orders were issued without any substantial change in circumstances
that would warrant such a significant modification in custody, as required under Texas Family Code Section 156.101.
Request for Relief:

Reversal of Temporary Custody and Eviction Orders:
a. The Petitioner respectfully requests the court to reverse the temporary orders regarding his eviction and the full custody
granted to the Respondent.
b. Restoration of Previous Custody Arrangement:
 The Petitioner seeks the restoration of the custody arrangement that existed prior to the temporary orders, where he
maintained a significant role in his children's lives.
c. Expedited Hearing: Given the urgency and significant impact on the Petitioner and his children, an expedited hearing is
requested.
Conclusion
The Petitioner respectfully urges the court to consider the detrimental impact of the current temporary orders on the
children's well-being and the Petitioner's parental rights. 
The Petitioner reaffirms his commitment to the best interest of his children and requests the court to modify the
temporary orders to restore the previous custody arrangement and allow him to return to his residence until a fair hearing
immediately, and without delay.
Respectfully submitted,
Charles

Dan, this is absurd. I can't let this broken system take advantage of my rights and damage my parent child relationship
based on NOTHING and allow Morgan to continuously fail to meet her obligations.
All I've done is diligently prepare. I know my rights. This is a clown show and I'm prepared to take matters into my own
hands if nobody else will.
Respectfully,
