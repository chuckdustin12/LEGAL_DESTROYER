BEFORE AND AFTER \n1. This side -by-side comparison illustrates the stark differences in the children\u2019s \nquality of life, parental involvement, and household stability before  and after  the removal of \nthe Father from the family home.  It presents a clear, fact -based evaluation of how the familial \nenvironment, care structure, and overall wellbeing of the children have been significantly \nimpacted. Each point demonstrates a substantial decline in stability, support, and morality\u2014raising urgent concerns about the children\u2019s best interests, safety, and development under the current arrangement . \n  \nIN RE: M.E.M., ET AL.    \n**CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, **   \n  \nPetitioner,   \n  \n PETITIONER\u2019S NOTICE  \nMORGAN MICHELLE MYERS,   \n  \nRespondent.   \n  \n2025 -04-02  233-765358-25 FILED\nTARRANT COUNTY\n4/2/2025 9:13 AM\nTHOMAS A.

All the above can be established through the numerous exhibits that have been \nprovided to the opposing side. After nearly twelve months of silence, there has been no objection, argument, opposition, or response offered for the exhibits given. More critically, there has been no response, opposition, or argument offered regarding the relief being sought from the Petitioner, which is simply to return to the residence that he was unlawfully removed from so that he can begin rebuilding the status quo of the children. Finally, we compare the benefits versus the detriments if granting relief to Petitioner: \nVI.

CONCLUSION \n This situation is destructive, and truly a one- sided case. Respondent\u2019s prolonged silence, \nin fact, says everything. Without any arguments or opposition on record, it begs the question as to how this situation has been permitted to persist as long as it has. The only drawbacks of granting relief fall on the Respondent \u2013 and are minor inconveniences at best that can neve r \noutweigh the benefits that the children would reap if relief were to be granted. All the Petitioner asked for in the beginning was time. N ow, time has been wasted, and we remain in the same \nspot. The point is \u2013 the Mother cannot just fabricate family violence to have Father removed from the home \u2013 especially when she knew and benefitted from his at-home business operations which have since been significantly damaged. Despite all the harm done, the Petitioner is confident that it can be repaired, the family  can get back on track, and this process can be finalized without sacrificing the stability and well-being of the children that they have been accustomed to throughout their lives. \n \n M.2002 M.2002\nM.2002 M.2002 M.2002 M.2002",

It doesn \u2019t come with good faith or arguments; it only comes with a false sense \nof urgency by the opposing counsel in this matter. This court has sat on its\u2019 hands for months, \nand then despite the failure to prosecute from the other side, it chooses to act on the wrong motion . Such a display is legally improper, unjustified, and showcases the complete disregard for \nwhat would otherwise be a prima facie case wa rranting dismissal for want of prosecution.  \nNow, rather than acting sua sponte  to set the DWOP for hearing, t he court instead \nchooses to entertain a prematurely  filed consolidation motion which it has no  jurisdiction to rule \non. As the  Texas  Supreme Court has held  previously: \u201c [a] plaintiff has a duty to \u201cprosecut[e] the \nsuit to a conclusion with reasonable diligence,\u201d failing which a trial court may dismiss for want of prosecution.\u201d In re Conner , 458 S.W.3d 532 (Tex. 2015) ( citing Callahan v. Staples , 139 Tex. \n8, 161 S.W.2d 489, 491 (1942) ). The court has wide discretion to manage its \u2019 docket, so it begs \nthe question as to why the court wants to act on its own accord on a motion to consolidate be fore \nthe case is  properly transferred . \nAlthough the writ of prohibition is intended to prevent this Court from setting a matter \nfor hearing that is procedurally improper, the issue in this case mirrors that addressed by the Texas Supreme Court in In re Conner , 458 S.W.3d 532 (Tex. 2015). There, the Court considered \nwhether a trial court abuses its discretion by refusing to grant a motion to dismiss for want of prosecution in the face of unmitigated and unexplained delay\u2014and held that it does. That is precisely  the circumstance presented here, and this intended writ of prohibition is to prevent this \ncourt from causing even further delays by setting a matter for a hearing which it ha s no M.2007 M.2007\nM.2007 M.2007 M.2007 M.2007",

LEGAL  FRAMEWORK \nA. Writ of Prohibition \nA writ of prohibition is an extraordinary legal remedy that serves specific, limited \npurposes in the Texas legal system. It is a judicial order issued by a higher court to prevent a \nlower court from exceeding its jurisdiction or interfering with the higher court's determination of a case.  \nKey characteristics of a writ of prohibition include: \n1. Limited Purpose Remedy : A writ of prohibition is used to protect the subject matter of \nan appeal or to prohibit unlawful interference with enforcement of a superior court's judgment ( Sivley v. Sivley, 972 S.W.2d 850, 863, Tex. App.\u2014Tyler 1998). \n2. Preventive Nature: The writ is designed to prevent future actions, not to remedy acts already completed. It can only be used to prevent what is about to be or could be done, not as a remedy for acts that are already completed (United States v. Hoffman, 71 U.S. 158, 1866). Here, Respondent seeks to use this writ as a means to prevent the court f rom \ncausing further delays by setting opposing counsel\u2019s improper motion to consolidate. \n3. Extraordinary Remedy : Courts have characterized a writ of prohibition as a \"drastic \nremedy\" and the legal equivalent of an equitable injunction ( In re Lewis , 223 S.W.3d 756, \n761, Tex. App.\u2014Texarkana 2007). This is a drastic circumstance. The Respondent has M.2008 M.2008\nM.2008 M.2008 M.2008 M.2008",

Last Resort : Prohibition is not appropriate if any other remedy, such as appeal, is \navailable and adequate ( In re Castle Tex. Prod. Ltd. P'ship, 189 S.W.3d 400, 404, Tex. \nApp.\u2014Tyler 2006). Here, Respondent has no adequate remedy by appeal, because there is currently no court with continuous, exclusive jurisdiction over the children in this matter.  \nIII. STATEMENT OF FACTS  \n5. On January 24, 2025, after more than 11 months of inaction, Petitioner  filed a Motion \nto Dismiss for Want of Prosecution in this court . The divorce case has had  no substantive action \nfrom Petitioner  since April 2024, a legal ghost ship drifting without direction or purpose. That \nmotion wasn\u2019t attempted to be set for hearing until September of 2024, only after the Respondent exhausted all efforts seeking relief throughout the Texas Judiciary without any participation from the opposing side. \n6. On March 19, 2025, driven by mounting concerns about the children\u2019s welfare and \nlearning that the 322\nnd District Court did not have continuous, exclusive jurisdiction over the \nchildren in this matter , Petitioner  filed a new SAPCR in the 233rd District Court (Cause No. 233-\n765358-25) seeking emergency relief for the children. The very next day, March 20, 2025, Ms. Carter suddenly reappeared like a character presumed missing  in the second act, filing an answer \nto the SAPCR petition in this Court and thereby submitting to this Court\u2019s jurisdiction by filing a \nresponse rather than a motion to abate.

On March 25, 2025, Respondent filed an Objection to Consolidation and an Ex- Parte \nEmergency Motion for TRO in the 233rd. Two days later, on March 27, 2025, Respondent \ncontacted the court coordinator, requested a date and time to present the motion, and served  the \ndocuments to the opposing party with the intent to present on March 28, 2025, at 9:00 A.M. before the Associate Judge of this Court. On that fateful morning of March 28, 2025, Respondent drove to the courthouse, paid for parking, met with the coordinator, communicated with opposing counsel, and secured a hearing date of April 10, 2025 agreed by the parties . \nRespondent then proceeded to the Associate Judge\u2019s courtroom to present the TRO. \n9. Before Respondent could present his case\u2014before he could speak a single word about \nhis children\u2019s welfare\u2014he  was told that Ms. Carter would be filing a motion to consolidate in the \n322nd District Court, that his motion was improperly before the 233\nrd court, and the Associate \nJudge refused to hear the motion. It was a curious thing, this refusal. Ms. Carter wasn\u2019t even present in the courtroom, yet her words carried more weight than Respondent\u2019s physical presence,  his properly filed papers, and most importantly, the urgent needs of his children. She \nstopped the proceedings with nothing more than word of mouth for the incorrect motion. A true showcasing of disregard for the process, and the children. \n10. On April 2, 2025, Respondent filed a Pre-Objection to Motion to Consolidate in the \n322\nnd District Court. Ms. Carter\u2019s motion to consolidate wasn\u2019t filed with the 322nd District \nCourt until April 3, 2025, six days after she used its mere possibility to  prevent the 233rd Court M.2010 M.2010\nM.2010 M.2010 M.2010 M.2010",

That same day, \nRespondent filed a Pre-Objection to Motion to Transfer in the 233rd Court, given that  a motion \nto transfer must come before any attempt at consolidation.

They have been removed from Petitioner\u2019s  \ncare and placed with elderly great -grandparents on a daily basis, and are being gaslighted into a \nfalse belief that the  divorce is finalized. Respondent\u2019s eldest child\u2019s academic performance has \nplummeted,  and both children have become emotionally estranged from both parents. \nRespondent has  suffered approximately $110,500 in verifiable financial damages due to being \nlocked out of his home and business, and it grows each day. But the financial toll pales in comparison to the emotional cost of watching Respondent\u2019s children  suffer while the courts \nexchange procedural ly incorrect  volleys over his head.  \nIV. THE PROHIBITION PREDICAMENT  \n13. The writ of prohibition exists for precisely this sort of situation \u2014where a court is \nabout to act in a way that exceeds its authority and threatens to compound an already untenable situation. The law on this matter is as clear as a bell on a still morning:  \n M.2011 M.2011\nM.2011 M.2011 M.2011 M.2011",

      "text": "7 \n A. The Procedural Parade Must Follow Its Proper Order \n14. The Texas Family Code establishes a clear sequence for the consolidation of cases \nfrom different courts. First, a motion to transfer must be filed and granted, bringing both cases \ninto the same court. Only then may a motion to consolidate be considered. See Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7\u00a7 155.201 and 6.407. \n15. This isn't merely a matter of dotting i's and crossing t's\u2014it's the fundamental roadmap \nthat ensures cases proceed in an orderly fashion. A court cannot consolidate what it does not possess, any more than a chef can cook ingredients that haven't yet been delivered to the kitchen. \n16. The Texas Supreme Court has consistently held that courts must follow proper \nprocedural sequence. In re Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., 35 S.W.3d 602, 605 (Tex. 2000). When a court attempts to rule on a matter for which it lacks jurisdiction or authority, prohibition is the appropriate remedy . In re Lewis , 223 S.W.3d 756, 761 (Tex. App.\u2014Texarkana 2007, orig. \nproceeding). \n17. Respondent is no legal scholar with a library of case law memorized, but even he can \nsee that this principle is as plain as a full moon on a cloudless night. This Court's potential willingness to hear a motion to consolidate before a motion to transfer has been filed and granted would be like a judge sentencing a defendant before the trial has begun\u2014 a clear inversion of the \nproper order of legal proceedings. \nB. The Discretion Dilemma  \n18. The writ of prohibition as used in Texas has three functions: \u20091) preventing \ninterference with higher courts in deciding a pending appeal, 2) preventing inferior courts from \nentertaining suits that will relitigate controversies which have already been settled by issuing M.2012 M.2012\nM.2012 M.2012 M.2012 M.2012",

Johnson, 864 S.W.2d 186, 187 (Tex.App.-\nTexarkana 1993, orig. proceeding). Here, function three is directly relevant. A court cannot hear a motion to consolidate a case it does not have before it.  \nC. Opposing  Counsel's Conduct  \n19. Ms. Carter's behavior throughout this saga deserves special attention, like a character \nin a novel whose actions consistently contradict their stated intentions. \n20. She abandoned the divorce case for nearly a year, filing nothing since April 2024, \nonly to suddenly reappear when Respondent sought emergency relief for the children \u2014like a \nfirefighter who ignores a smoldering house for months, only to rush in when someone else calls \nfor help. \n21. She filed an answer in the 233rd Court, thereby submitting to its jurisdiction, only to \nthen argue that the case belongs in this Court\u2014a contradiction as glaring as claiming to be both inside and outside a room simultaneously. \n22. She used the mere possibility of a future filing to block an emergency hearing, then \nwaited six days to file  the motion \u2014a delay that speaks volumes about the true urgency of the \nmatter. \n23. She filed a motion to consolidate without first filing a motion to transfer, putting the \nprocedural cart before the horse in a manner that defies both logic and law.

She now claims to be unavailable until late April, creating further delay after using \nthe urgency of consolidation to block Respondent\u2019s emergency hearing \u2014a scheduling \ncontradiction that would be comical if not for the children caught in its web. \n25. This pattern reveals a tactical attempt to manipulate both courts' dockets to prevent \nme from obtaining timely relief. It's a shell game played with Respondent\u2019s children's welfare as \nthe prize. This Court should not allow itself to be used as an instrument in such procedural gamesmanship, particularly when children's lives hang in the balance. \nV.  MORAL  FIBER  \n26. If there's a lesson to be drawn from this procedural quagmire, it's that the law's \ncomplexity should never obscure its fundamental purpose: to provide justice, particularly for those most vulnerable. My children\u2014innocent bystanders in this adult conflict\u2014have become collateral damage in a game of procedural chess where the rules seem to change with each move.  \n27. It has been stated that the true measure of a society is found in how it treats its most \nvulnerable members. By that measure, the procedural labyrinth that has prevented the 233rd Court from hearing Respondent\u2019s emergency motion, and now threatens to compound the error by having this Court act prematurely, speaks volumes about how far we have strayed from the ideal of justice.  \n28. Respondent provide this notice not out of anger or vindictiveness, but out of that \nquiet, bewildered astonishment that settles in a person's bones when they've witnessed the law being twisted into shapes that would make a carnival contortionist blush with envy.

As Mark Twain might have observed, the difference between proper procedure and \nimproper procedure is not merely academic\u2014it's the difference between justice served and justice denied, between children protected and children neglected, between a system that works and one that merely pretends to. \nVI. CONCLUSION AND PRAYER  \n31. I respectfully request that this Court pause, reflect on the procedural peculiarity \nbefore it, and decline to hear a motion to consolidate until the proper preliminary steps have been taken. Specifically, I ask that this Court: \na. Recognize that it lacks jurisdiction to hear a motion to consolidate until a motion to transfer has been filed in the 233rd Court and granted; \nb. Take judicial notice that Petitioner submitted to the 233rd Court's jurisdiction by \nanswering the SAPCR petition; \nc. Acknowledge the improper procedural sequence attempted by Petitioner's counsel in \nfiling a motion to consolidate without first filing a motion to transfer; \nd. Consider that proceeding with a hearing on the consolidation motion would only \ncompound the procedural irregularities and further delay relief for the children; \n M.2015 M.2015\nM.2015 M.2015 M.2015 M.2015",

      "text": "13 \n ARGUMENT  \nA. Mandamus Standard \nMandamus relief is not merely appropriate but imperative  in this case \nbecause the trial court's inaction and the continued enforcement of a void order \nconstitute a clear abuse of discretion for which Relator has no adequate remedy at \nlaw. The Texas Supreme Court has consistently and unequivocally held that to obtain mandamus relief, a Relator must show (1) the trial court clearly abused its \ndiscretion or violated a duty imposed by law, and (2) there is no adequate remedy by appeal. In re Bass, 113 S.W.3d 735, 738 (Tex. 2003) (orig. proceeding); Walker \nv. Packer , 827 S.W.2d 833, 839 (Tex. 1992).  \nTexas jurisprudence firmly establishes that mandamus will lie to correct a \nvoid order, even without a traditional showing of inadequate appellate remedy. As \nthe Supreme Court of Texas definitively stated in Urbish v.  127th Judicial Dist. \nCourt , 708 S.W.2d 429, 431 (Tex. 1986) (orig. proceeding), mandamus will issue \nto correct a void order, i.e., an order the trial court had no power or jurisdiction to render. The Court has further emphasized in In re Sw. Bell Tel. Co. , 35 S.W.3d 602, \n605 (Tex. 2000) (orig. proceeding) that if an order is void, the Relator need not \nshow he lacks an adequate appellate remedy, and mandamus relief is appropriate. \nThis principle was recently reaffirmed in In re J.R. , No. 02 -21-00060- CV , 2021 \nWL 1421440 (Tex. App. \u2014Fort Worth Apr. 15, 2021, orig. proceeding), where the M.2038 M.2038\nM.2038 M.2038 M.2038 M.2038",

      "text": "14 \n court explicitly stated: \"A trial court abuses its discretion if it enters a void order, \nand mandamus will issue to remedy the void order regardless of whether the relator \nhas an adequate remedy by appeal.\"  \nB. The temporary orders rendered on March 14, 2024, are void ab initio  \nA fundamental and inviolable principle in Texas jurisprudence is that a \njudgment based on a settlement requires the consent of both parties at the time it is \nrendered by the court. The Texas Supreme Court's seminal decision in Burnaman v. Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 (1951) established the bedrock principle that a party \nis free to withdraw their consent to a settlement at any time before the judgment is rendered. The Court's language was unambiguous and leaves no room for \ninterpretation: \"A valid consent judgment cannot be rendered by a court when \nconsent of one of the parties thereto is wanting. It is not sufficient that a party's \nconsent may at one time have been given; consent must exist at the very moment \nthe court undertakes to make the agreement the judgment of the court.\" Id.  This \nprinciple has been consistently reaffirmed, as in Carter v. Carter, 535 S.W.2d 215 \n(Tex. Civ. App. 1976), which emphasized that \"the law seems to be clear that a consent judgment cannot be rendered by a trial court when consent of one of the parties is lacking, even though that consent may have been previously given.\"  \nIn the present case, the only orders rendered by any court were rendered as \nconsent judgments but lack the signatures of all parties.

APP 2.38 . The Court must \nrecognize that the absence of the Relator\u2019s  signature is not a mere technical \ndeficiency but a fatal jurisdictional flaw that renders the orders void ab initio. Because his signature was required to effectuate consent, and the orders themselves \nacknowledge this requirement, the orders are unquestionably void.  \nC. Outright refusing to hear the emergency TRO is a clear abuse of discretion  \nIt is well- settled and beyond legitimate dispute that a trial court has a \nministerial duty to consider and rule on motions that have been properly filed and \nbrought to the court's attention. The Texas Court of Appeals has emphatically \nstated, \"When a motio n is properly filed and pending before the trial court, the act \nof giving consideration to and ruling upon that motion is a ministerial act, and \nmandamus may issue to compel the trial judge to act.\" Safety -Kleen Corp. v. \nGarcia , 945 S.W.2d 268, 269 (Tex. A pp.- San Antonio 1997, orig. proceeding). To \nestablish an abuse of discretion for refusal to rule, the relator must show: (1) the trial court had a legal duty to perform a nondiscretionary act, (2) the relator \nrequested performance of that act, and (3) the  trial court failed or refused to do so.

It is undisputed that the 322nd Court never rendered any final order \nregarding the children.  Without a final order, the 322nd Court never acquired \ncontinuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the children.

Ms. Carter wasn\u2019t even present in the courtroom, yet \nher words carried more weight than Petitioner\u2019s physical presence,  his properly \nfiled papers, and most importantly, the urgent needs of his children. She stopped the proceedings with nothing more than word of mouth for the incorrect motion. A true showcasing of disregard for the process, and the children. \n6. On April 2, 2025, Petitioner  filed a Pre -Objection to Motion to \nConsolidate in the 322\nnd District Court. Ms. Carter\u2019s motion to consolidate wasn\u2019t \nfiled with the 322nd District Court until April 3, 2025 \u2014six days after she used its \nmere possibility to  prevent this Court from hearing Petitioner\u2019s  emergency \nmotion.

On April 4, 2025, unable to acquire a ruling due to Petitioner\u2019s \nobjection, Ms. Carter attempted to set the motion for a hearing before the 322nd District Court. That same day, Petitioner  filed a Pre-Objection to Motion to \nTransfer in this Court, given that  a motion to transfer must come before any \nattempt at consolidation.  Ms. Carter, who had been so urgently concerned about \nconsolidation when it served to block Petitioner\u2019s  emergency hearing, suddenly \nclaimed to be unavailable until late April\u2014causing significant delays that could have been avoided had this Court simply heard the motion before it on March 28, 2025.

They have \nbeen  removed from Petitioner\u2019s  care and placed with elderly great -grandparents \non a daily basis, and are being gaslighted into a false belief that the  divorce is \nfinalized. Petitioner\u2019s  eldest child\u2019s academic performance has plummeted,  and \nboth children have become emotionally estranged from both parents. Petitioner  \nhas suffered approximately $110,500 in verifiable financial damages due to being \nlocked out of his home and business, and it grows each day. But the financial toll \npales in comparison to the emotional cost of watching Petitioner\u2019s  children  suffer \nwhile the courts exchange procedurally incorrect  volleys over his head.  \nIII. ARGUMENT  \nA. The Court's Ministerial Duty  \n9. It is well- established Texas law that a trial court has a ministerial \nduty\u2014not a discretionary duty\u2014to consider and rule upon motions properly filed and pending before it. In re Sheppard, 193 S.W.3d 181, 183 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2006, orig. proceeding); In re Chavez, 62 S.W.3d 225, 228 (Tex. App.\u2014Amarillo 2001, orig. proceeding). The Texas Supreme Court has consistently held that while a court has discretion in how it rules on a motion, it has no discretion to refuse to rule at all. In re Blakeney, 254 S.W.3d 659, 661 (Tex. App.\u2014Texarkana 2008, orig. proceeding) (\"When a motion is properly filed and pending before a trial court, the act of considering and ruling upon that M.2072 M.2072\nM.2072 M.2072 M.2072 M.2072",

      "text": "8 \n motion is a ministerial act, and mandamus may issue to compel the trial judge to \nact.\").  \n10. This principle is not merely a procedural nicety but a fundamental \ncornerstone of our judicial system. When a court refuses to hear a properly filed motion, it effectively denies access to justice itself. As the Texas courts have repeatedly emphasized,  \"A trial court's refusal to rule on a pending motion within \na reasonable amount of time constitutes a clear abuse of discretion.\" In re Bonds, 57 S.W.3d 456, 457 (Tex. App.\u2014San Antonio 2001, orig. proceeding). This abuse is magnified exponentially when the motion concerns the welfare of children and seeks emergency relief.  \n11. The Court's refusal to hear Petitioner's properly filed emergency TRO \non March 28, 2025, constitutes a clear failure to perform a ministerial duty. This failure is particularly concerning  given that: \na) The motion was properly filed and noticed for hearing and the parties agreed on a date and time set for April 10\nth, 2025; \nb) Petitioner communicated with court staff, physically appeared at the courthouse ready to present the motion and was told he could present his motion ; \n    c) The motion concerned the immediate welfare of children; and  \n    d) The refusal was based solely on representations about a future filing in another court that had not yet occurred.

In re Prudential Ins. Co. of \nAm., 148 S.W.3d 124, 135-36 (Tex. 2004); Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, \n840 (Tex. 1992) . An abuse if discretion is clearly established from point one \nbelow, and supported by points two through eight: \ni. First, it refused to perform its ministerial duty to hear and \nrule on a properly filed motion based solely on representations \nabout a future filing in another court. It\u2019s as if a doctor refused to \ntreat a bleeding patient because another doctor  might, at some \nfuture date, claim the patient should be treated at a different  \nhospital. \nii. Second, it failed to recognize that by answering the \nSAPCR petition in  this Court, Respondent submitted to this \nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction and should have instead filed a motion to abate \nor should have moved to transfer the case. The law doesn\u2019t allow \nfor half-measures of jurisdiction. \niii. Third, it failed to recognize that this Court maintained \njurisdiction until any  transfer was completed pursuant to Texas \nFamily Code \u00a7 155.005(d) as no final order has been rendered in \nthe 322nd District Court.

However, this \npresumption can be overcome by showing that the first suit was initiated in bad faith or for the purpose of delay. Texas courts, following the rule established in Wyatt v.

General Principles  \nUnder Texas law, the doctrine of dominant jurisdiction provides that when two suits are \npending in courts of concurrent jurisdiction involving the same parties and subject matter, the \ncourt in which the suit was first filed acquires dominant jurisdiction to the exclusion of the other court. This doctrine is established in the seminal case of Curtis v. Gibbs , 511 S.W.2d 263 (Tex. \n1974), where the Texas Supreme Court held that any subsequent suit involving the same parties and controversy must be dismissed if a party to that suit calls the second court's attention to the pendency of the prior suit. \nB. Bad Faith Exception \nHowever, Texas courts recognize an important exception to the dominant jurisdiction \ndoctrine: when the first-filed suit was brought in bad faith or for the purpose of delay. As \nestablished in Wyatt v. Shaw Plumbing Co., 760 S.W.2d 245, 248 (Tex. 1988), the first court's \ndominant jurisdiction can be defeated by showing that the first suit was filed: \n1. As a mere pretext to establish priority; \n2. In anticipation of the second suit; \n3. For the purpose of delay; or \n4. In bad faith. \nWhen this exception applies, the second court may proceed with its case despite the pendency of the first- filed suit.  M.2090 M.2090\nM.2090 M.2090 M.2090 M.2090",

Strategic Approach for Rehearing Motion\nIn the motion for rehearing, the bad faith analysis should be presented as an independent, \nalternative ground for mandamus relief: \n1.Primary Argument : The consolidation order should be vacated due to procedural defects\n(lack of notice, hearing, proper transfer).\n2.Alternative Argument : Even if procedurally proper, consolidation was improper\nbecause the first -filed suit's dominant jurisdiction was defeated by bad faith.\n3.Relief Requested : The court should:\n\u2022Vacate the consolidation order\n\u2022Recognize the 233rd District Court's authority to proceed independently with theSAPCR\n\u2022Order the trial court to hear Charles's emergency TRO on its merits\nV . Conclusion\nThe doctrine of dominant jurisdiction is not an absolute rule but a principle of judicial \nefficiency that yields when its application would reward bad faith or procedural gamesmanship. The extensive evidence of coordination before filing, false statements in court documents, and systematic non -prosecution after securing favorable orders demonstrates that the initial divorce \nfiling was made in bad faith.

(MR 2.7) \nThis frenzy of frivolous lawsuits was designed to acquire an advantage \nin the divorce proceedings, which ultimately succeeded on January 16, 2024.

Spinning a narrative of the need for protection, Real Party leveraged \nthis initial award to her advantage and was able to delay the proceedings \nfurther on January 22 by acquiring her legal representative three minutes prior \nto the hearing. (MR 7), eventually leading to settlement and a non- suit of her \nallegations (MR 8.3), which became the orders of the court on March 14, \n2024, and were rendered as an agreement without M r. Myers \u2019 consent. (MR. \n17.38) The r emainder of the litigation amounted to a one -sided effort by the \nundersigned to seek relief while the opposing party sat in silence and \nabandoned their case. ( MR 1) \nAfter eleven months of silence, the Real Party became active again \nonly after the SAPCR was opened by Mr. Myers, who was prevented from \npresenting his emergency TRO at the 11th hour, resulting in no order, and \nthe emergency still ongoing.\nShortly after the initial mandamus was filed on April 10, \n2025, the Honorable Kenneth Newell sua sponte consolidated the \ncases without notice by granting Real Party\u2019s motion in the face of \nan objection, and without a hearing to discuss the pertinent issues. \nThe undersigned is prepared to litigate these matters, and the necessity \nto stay these proceedings is essential to preserve the rights of the parties and \nprevent f urther i rreparable harm from occurring in the interim.

These matters can \nbe concurrently resolved through stepwise legal analysis. The first and most \ncritical question is whether the current temporary orders\u2014issued as an \nagreed judgement without the consent of all parties\u2014can stand (MR 17.1, \nMR 17.38).

Fam. Code \u00a7 155.001. In \nthat event, the SAPCR filed in the 233rd District Court by the undersigned should stand as a procedurally proper original suit, and mandamus should \nissue to administer a hearing regarding the emergency TRO refused on \nMarch 28, 2025,  without producing any valid order to challenge . \nAt that juncture, should the Real Party argue dominant jurisdiction, the \ncourt must weigh the well -recognized exceptions under Texas law, including \nbad faith, unjustified delay, and strategic pretext \u2014all of which are clearly \ndemonstrated and conclusively established in the mandamus record filed \nconcurrently with this matter.  \nV.

This \ndoctrine is established in the seminal case of Curtis v. Gibbs , 511 S.W.2d 263 \n(Tex. 1974), where the Texas Supreme Court held that any subsequent suit \ninvolving the same parties and controversy must be dismissed if a party to that \nsuit calls the second court's  attention to the pendency of the prior suit.  \nNormally, if the SAPCR matter were to try and set a matter for hearing, \nthe Real Party could argue for dominant jurisdiction, as the divorce matter M.2114 M.2114\nM.2114 M.2114 M.2114 M.2114",

Bad Faith Exception\nHowever, Texas courts recognize an important exception to the \ndominant jurisdiction doctrine: when the first -filed suit was brought in bad \nfaith or for the purpose of dela y. As established in Wyatt v. Shaw Plumbing \nCo., 760 S. W.2d 245, 248 ( Tex. 1988), the first court's dominant jurisdiction \ncan be defeated by showing that the first suit was filed:  \n1. As a mere pretext to establish priority;\n2. In anticipation of the second suit;\n3. For the purpose of delay; or\n4. In bad faith.\nE. Three of four  exceptions to dominant jurisdiction apply here\nHere, three out of four of these exceptions apply. The suit was a mere \npretext to establish priority, as Real Party went out of her way to file multiple \nfrivolous lawsuits alleging family violence (MR 2.7, MR 3) only to then drop \nher claims after securing the children and home and abandon the case.

On her original petition for divorce, on \npage 7, Real Party makes it known that she attempted to seek an emergency \nex-parte order of protection on December 14, 2023. (MR 2.7) So the logical \nquestion to ask would be: why did Real Party need an emergency ex- parte \norder of protection if she already had an active order of protection? Better \nyet, why did mother seek a third protective order on December 22, 2023, if an \nactive protective  order was already in place? (MR 3)  More importantly, why \nwould she claim an active order of protection existed when she knew that \nwasn\u2019t the case? (MR 2.7 ) This is a clear establishment of bad faith litigation, \nwhich also precluded her advantage  by labeling the undersigned as an abuser  \nprior to adjudication, satisfying two of four exceptions to dominant \njurisdiction.  \nFinally, after acquiring the children and home  at the outset (MR. 6.1) \nand through the series of orders leading up to March 14, 2024 , Real Party \nthen abandoned her case and  left the undersigned seeking relief throughout \nthe Texas judiciary without opposition or participation . The only item found \non the docket from the opposing side since then is a motion for pre -trial \nconference on April 24, 2024.

      "text": "19 C. ABUSE OF DISCRETION\nImmediately after submitting his first mandamus petition, Mr. Myers was \nserved with an ORDER GRANTING CONSOLIDATION. (MR 15)  This motion, \nwhich was used as a barrier to relief, was granted sua sponte by the same court \nwho just declined to hear an emergency TRO  before it . \nThe record leaves no doubt that Respondent\u2019s decision to consolidate the \ncases without notice or a hearing was a gross departure from the fair administration \nof justice . It is difficult to imagine a more textbook abuse of discretion: a contested  \nmotion was granted sua sponte , with no opportunity for the opposing party to be \nheard. This is not a close call or a minor procedural wrinkle. The facts speak for themselves \u2013 equity, due process, and basic procedural fairness were all denied in \none fell swoop.  The only question is whether they will continue to be ignored.  \nTexas courts have held that a trial court clearly abuses its discretion by \ngranting a contested motion sua sponte without providing notice or a hearing. In \nD.A. Buckner Constr., Inc. v. Hobson, for example, the trial judge entered an order\n(imposing sanctions) even though the affected party had no notice or opportunity to \nbe heard. The court of appeals declared that order void  and emphatically stated: \n\u201cRespondent\u2019s order was without notice or hearing. Under these circumstances, the \ntrial court\u2019s order is void, and mandamus will lie to vacate such an order.\u201d  Such is \nthe case here. Therefore, the law should apply equally.

Perry v. Del Rio , 66 S.W.3d 239, 257 (Tex.2001) (orig.proceeding). As \nrepeatedly stated throughout these proceedings, Relator has been deprived of the \nmost fundamental rights one can have: the right to possess and protect his home, \nand the right to care for, maintain contact with, and make decisions regarding his minor children. These rights are not abstract \u2014 they are protected by the U.S. \nConstitution, the Texas Constitution, and longstanding precedent . \nE. ONGOING AND IRREPARABLE HARM  \nThe Texas Supreme Court has repeatedly reaffirmed that \u201ca parent\u2019s rights to \nthe care, custody, and control of their children are constitutional in nature and must be afforded heightened protection.\u201d In re C.J.C. , 603 S.W.3d 804, 809 (Tex. 2020).  \nLikewise, property rights \u2014 including the right to remain in and possess one\u2019s \nhome \u2014 are protected under Article I, Section 19 of the Texas Constitution and the \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

For all reasons incorporated herein, the  \ncourt should uphold Texas precedent, and issue mandamus relief to restore justice \nto these proceedings.  \nCONCLUSION  \nWith a prima facie showing of systemic abuse laid bare across the trilogy of \nmandamus petitions now before this Court, it is no longer credible to characterize \nthe lower court\u2019s conduct as isolated error. Two of the three heads of this \nprocedural dragon\u2014embodied by the 233rd, the 322nd, and this very Court\u2014have \nalready rendered per curiam denials, offering no explanation in the face of \ndocumented, unrebutted misconduct.

      "text": "6 STATEMENT  OF FACTS  \nOn March 19, 2025, Relator filed a SAPCR as an original proceeding in the \n233rd District Court of Tarrant County which was subsequently answered by \ncounsel for Real Party in Interest  the following day . (MR 3).  An emergency TRO \nwas later filed on March 24, 2025, in the 233rd District Court of Tarrant County. \n(MR 7, MR 7.26) The trial court was asked to perform a ministerial duty when a \ndate and time was secured to present the motion. (SUPP 2.11, SUPP 2.24, SUPP \n2.26) . The undersigned appeared on March 28, 2025, and it is undeniable that the \nfull hearing was set for April 10, 2025, at 9:30a.m. The judge refused to hear the  \nmotion . Accordingly, no appealable order was issued.   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT  \nIt is clear that the trial court below had a ministerial duty to act and refused \nto do so. When a trial court fails to rule on a motion that is properly filed and \nbrought to its attention, the abuse of discretion is established as a matter of law. This aligns with longstanding mandamus jurisprudence , which requires only three \nelements  to establish a clear abuse of discretion : the existence of a legal duty to \nact, a clear request for that action, and the court\u2019s failure or refusal to do so.  In re \nShredder C o., L.L.C., 225 S.W.3d 676, 679 (Tex. App. - El Paso 2006, orig.  \nproceeding); Stoner v. Massey , 586 S.W.2d 843, 846 (Tex. 1979).  All three \nelements are present here.

Although disfavored in routine matters, en banc reconsideration is\nappropriate  where the legal standard is met, as it is here.\nEn banc  reconsideration is reserved for the rare case that satisfies one or \nboth of the \u201chard- to-satisfy requirements\u201d set forth in Texas Rule of Appellate \nProcedure 41.2(c): ensuring uniformity in the court\u2019s decisions or addressing \nextraordinary circumstances. The Texas Supreme Court has endorsed this narrow \nstandard, cautioning against overuse to preserve judicial efficiency and ensure that \n\u201cthe appellate trains... run on time.\u201d See In re Marriage of Harrison , 507 S.W.3d \n259, 260 \u201361 (Tex. App. \u2014[14th Dist.] 2016) (Frost, J., dissenting).   \nHere, this  is precisely the kind of novel case that warrants en banc  \nreconsideration. T he panel\u2019s decision threatens a  fundamental departure  from \nsettled Texas law \u2014made more urgent by the fact that the emergency relief sought \nis on behalf of two minor children  and remains unopposed by any party at the time \nof filing this motion.  \nFurther, the subject matter of this case \u2014three concurrently pending \nmandamus proceedings, all arising from distinct but interconnected abuses of discretion \u2014constitutes an extraordinary circumstance. Each petition was denied \nper curiam  by the same panel  despite a clearly established record of procedural \nviolations and judicial inaction. The en banc  court should examine and correct the M.2162 M.2162\nM.2162 M.2162 M.2162 M.2162",

The panel\u2019s per curiam  denial conflicts with controlling authority and\noverlooks critical facts established in the mandamus and\nsupplemental mandamus records .\n\"When a motion is properly filed and pending before the trial court, the act \nof givi ng consideration to and ruling upon that motion is a ministerial act, and \nmandamus may issue to compel the trial judge to act.\"  Safety -Kleen Corp. v. \nGarcia , 945 S.W.2d 268, 269 (Tex. App. - San Antonio 1997, orig. proceeding).  \nHowever, the Relator  must demonstrate  that the trial court abused its discretion by \nfailing or refusing to perform  a ministerial act.  \nA.The trial court abused its discretion by failing to rule on a properly filed\nmotion after being asked to act.\nTo establish an abuse of discretion, the Relator must show that the trial court \nreceived a properly filed motion, was made aware of it, and was asked to rule \u2014\nwhether through direct correspondence or other documents drawing the court\u2019s \nattention to the matt er. See In re Villarreal, 96 S.W.3d 708, 710 (Tex.

When a motion has \nbeen properly filed and brought to the attention of the trial court, the act of considering and ruling upon the motion is ministerial in nature, and mandamus \nmay issue to compel the trial court to act.

      "text": "I. INTRODUCTION AND ISSUE PRESENTED  \nA. Overview of the Case  \nThis report examines whether the Temporary Orders signed on March 26, 2024, \nin Cause No. 322-744263- 23 (322nd District Court, Tarrant County) are facially void or \nlegally invalid. Evidence indicates serious procedural irregularities in how the Associate \nJudge's Reports from February 1, 2024, and March 14, 2024, were handled.  \nThe case involves a family law matter between Morgan Myers (Petitioner) and \nCharles Myers (Respondent). The procedural history reveals a concerning pattern of deviations from standard legal practice and explicit judicial directives. Of particular concern are the following newly uncovered facts:  \nThe February 1, 2024,  Associate Judge's Report required a typed Temporary \nOrders conforming to the report to be prepared by attorney Dan Bacalis within 20 days, approved by both attorneys within 5 days, and set for entry (\"motion to sign\") within 30 days if no agreement.  \nThe order filed  (March 26, 2024 Temporary Orders) was prepared well past the \n20-day/30-day deadlines \u2013 in fact about 44 days later \u2013 and by Cooper L. Carter \n(opposing counsel) instead of Dan Bacalis. It was not reviewed or approved by Charles's attorney (Bacalis had ceased representing Charles by then), and Charles was pressured to \nsign it immediately on March 26, 2024, under threat of adverse action, rather than being \ngiven the 5- day review period the Associate Judge had ordered  and the parties actually \nhad agreed to.  \nThe March 14, 2024,  Associate Judge's Report contains handwritten directives \nwritten by opposing counsel, not the judge, including a coercive ultimatum that final orders must be presented by 1:30 PM that same day. The report notes that Charles objected to the form of the proposed order and refused to approve Paragraph 3 \u2013 \nevidencing that no true agreement on all terms existed.  \nB.

      "text": "This research paper addresses the following central question: Do these procedural \nfailures \u2013 including non-compliance with the Associate Judge's instructions, lack of \nrequired signatures/approvals, and coerced \"consent\" \u2013 render the February 1 and March \n14 reports never properly converted into a valid court order, and thus make the March 26, \n2024,  Temporary Orders facially void or otherwise invalid?  \nThe analysis will address the governing law (Texas Family Code provisions, \nTexas Rules of Civil Procedure, and case law) and analyze potential due process \nviolations. The paper will also discuss remedies, including whether mandamus relief or other direct attacks are appropriate to vacate the orders.  \nII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nA. February 1, 2024 \u2013 Associate Judge's Hearing and Report  \nOn February 1, 2024, an Associate Judge never heard Petitioner Morgan Myers's \nmotion for temporary orders.  The purpose of the setting was for Petitioner to produce \nevidence of her family violence claims. According to the Associate Judge's Report for \nTemporary Orders signed that day, both parties appeared with counsel. The report recites \nthat Petitioner (Morgan) and Respondent (Charles) \"signed an Associate Judge's Report \nregarding Agreed Temporary Orders. \" In other words, the Associate Judge\u2019s Report for \nTemporary Orders was represented as an agreed order. \nNotably, however, the February 1 report itself was not a final typed order; it was a \nhandwritten form that Dan Bacalis, not the Associate Judge, completed. Crucially, at the \nend of the hearing the Associate Judge did not enter a final written order but instead set out a procedure to finalize one:  \n1. A typed Temporary Order conforming to the Associate Judge's Report was to be prepared within 20 days of February 1, 2024. The report explicitly says: \"A typed written Order conforming to this Report will follow within 20 days from the date \nthis Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be prepared by [Dan Bacalis].\"  M.2178 M.2178\nM.2178 M.2178 M.2178 M.2178",

      "text": "2. Each attorney was to approve the order, with 5 days for review. The report states: \n\"Each attorney should approve the Order. The parties do not need to approve the Order. The attorney reviewing the proposed Order shall have five (5) days to do \nso.\" Thus, both Morgan's and Charles's attorneys were required to sign off as to \nform; the parties' signatures on the final typed version were not strictly required \nby this instruction (since it says parties \"do not need to approve\"), but the initial report it self cont emplated an agreed order and included signature lines for the \nparties as evidence of their agreement. In practice, for an agreed family order it is standard that both parties and counsel sign \"Approved as to Form and Substance.\"  \n3. If the attorneys could not agree on the form of order, a \"Motion to Sign\" hearing was to be set within 30 days of February 1. The report directs: \"If an agreement is not reached, a Motion to Sign shall be filed and set within thirty (30) days from the signing of this Report.\" This meant by approximately March 2, 2024, any \ndispute about the order's wording or contents should be brought to the court for \nresolution.  \nFinally, the February 1 Associate Judge's Report has an \"AGREED AS TO FORM \nAND SUBSTANCE\" signature block for the parties and attorneys.  \nThe Associate Judge did sign the report on February 1, making the report effective as \nan interim order of the court. Under Texas Family Code \u00a7 201.013, a signed Associate \nJudge's proposed order is in full force and effect pending any request for a de novo \nhearing by the referring court. No request for a de novo hearing was filed by either party \nwithin the 3 -working-day window (Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 201.015(a)). Therefore, the \nAssociate Judge's rulings of February 1 became the governing temporary orders in effect  \n\u2013 but only in the form of the handwritten report, pending entry of the formal typed order.  \nB. March 14, 2024 \u2013 Attempt to Finalize Order and Second AJ's Report  \nBy early March 2024, no agreed typed order had been submitted or signed. Dan \nBacalis (Charles's attorney) did not prepare the order within 20 days, nor was a Motion to M.2179 M.2179\nM.2179 M.2179 M.2179 M.2179",

In fact, during this period Charles's counsel was terminated  \nfrom representation just four days after the associate judge\u2019s report was signed on \nFebruary 1. To address the basis for any agreement being fraudulent, Charles promptly \nfiled an emergency motion to reconsider evidence and vacate any agreement, which was eventually set for March 14 due to Cooper Carter\u2019s availability.  \nAt the March 14 proceeding, instead of simply holding an entry hearing, the \ncourt and counsel engaged in off -the-record discussions to get the order finalized. \nOpposing counsel (Cooper Carter) took it upon herself  to hand-write the directives on a \nnew Associate Judge's Report form. These handwritten notes (penned by Carter, not the judge) included a coercive instruction that Charles must sign the final order by 1:30 PM \nthat same day (March 14).  \nEssentially, Charles was given an ultimatum to immediately acquiesce to the \nwritten order's terms. The March 14 report also documented that Charles objected to the form of the order and specifically did not approve Paragraph 3 (a provision in the draft \norder). In other words, as of March 14 there was not a full meeting of the minds \u2013 Charles \nhad an unresolved objection to at least one substantive term. Despite this, the pressure was on to finalize the order that day , and the purpose of being there was for a n entire \ndifferent purpose.  \nImportantly, the handwritten March 14 notes were not written by the judge and \nwere not traditional judicial findings or rulings \u2013 they were more in the nature of \ninstructions and a deadline apparently dictated by opposing counsel. There is no \nindication th e Associate Judge held an evidentiary hearing on March 14 or made \nindependent findings; instead, it appears the goal was simply to force execution of the \npreviously \"agreed\" temporary order that had essentially been nullified by Dan Bacalis\u2019 departure from  the case.  \nC. March 26, 2024 \u2013 Filing of the Temporary Orders and Circumstances of Signing \nOn March 26, 2024, a typed \"Temporary Orders\" document was finally filed with the \nDistrict Clerk.

It was drafted by Cooper L. Carter, counsel for Morgan (as evidenced by the signature block indicating Carter's authorship and by the fact that Bacalis was no longer involved). This violated the Associate Judge's explicit instruction that Dan Bacalis would  prepare the order. In effect, opposing counsel unilaterally drafted \nthe order.  \n2. It was prepared and filed well after the 20 -day deadline set by the February 1 \nreport. Nearly two months had elapsed (far beyond the expected February 21 \ndeadline for drafting and March 2 deadline for a motion to sign). No extension or \nmodification of the Associate Judge's timeline was on record. Thus, the order was \nuntimely under the terms of the February 1 directive.  \n3. Critically, the order was not reviewed or approved by Charles Myers's attorney. By the time the order was drafted in late March, Charles had no attorney of record (Bacalis did not sign the order and had withdrawn). The February 1 report's procedure \u2013 requi ring each attorney to approve within 5 days \u2013 became \nimpossible to follow, since Charles had no counsel to review the draft. Carter did not seek approval from any attorney on Charles's side. In fact, the signature block shows Dan Bacalis's signature line b lank (he did not sign off because he wasn't \neven on the case).  \n4. The March 26 order was presented to Charles for his signature on extremely short notice (apparently on the same day). Charles did not sign the order. He was essentially confronted with the final order and told to sign immediately (recall the March 14 \"1:30 PM deadline\" threat) or face adverse consequences (the \nimplication being the judge would sign it without his consent or possibly hold him in contempt or consider him uncooperative). Feeling coerced and with no counsel to advise him, Charles signed \"Approved and Consented to as to Form and Substance\" on March 26, 2024 \u2013 but this signature was not truly voluntary. It \nwas done under protest to avoid an even worse outcome. It is telling that Charles M.2181 M.2181\nM.2181 M.2181 M.2181 M.2181",

The recitals in the March 26 Temporary Orders are misleading. The order opens by reciting that both parties appeared on February 1 and \"signed an Associate Judge's Report regarding Agreed Temporary Orders\", and that \"The parties have \nagreed to the terms of this order as evidenced by the signatures below.\"  While \nMorgan and her counsel indeed signed the report, Charles's signature was not on \nthat report, so that recital is factually inaccurate. Thus, the very foundation \u2013 that \nthe order is an agreed order \u2013 i s incorrect. \nIn summary, the March 26, 2024,  Temporary Orders were entered following a \nprocess in which the Associate Judge's explicit procedures were not observed, one party's counsel was no longer involved to approve the order, and the other party's consent was \neffectively forced. \nIII. LEGAL FRAMEWORK  \nA. Authority of Associate Judges and Requirements for Temporary Orders  \nAssociate Judge's Orders and Reports (Texas Family Code Ch. 201)  \nIn Texas family law cases, an associate judge may hear temporary orders matters \nand issue a report or even render an order, but certain procedures apply. Under Tex. \nFamily Code \u00a7 201.011, an associate judge's report must be in writing and in the form directed by the referring court. The associate judge can include a proposed order in the \nreport. After the hearing, notice of the substance of the report must be given to the parties \n(which can be done in open court, as happened on February 1).  \nCrucially, parties have a right to request a de novo hearing before the referring \nDistrict Judge within a short window (generally 3 working days for temporary orders in SAPCR cases) after receiving notice of the associate judge's report. See Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 \n201.015(a). If no timely de novo hearing is requested, the associate judge's proposed M.2182 M.2182\nM.2182 M.2182 M.2182 M.2182",

      "text": "order may be adopted and enforced as an order of the district court. In fact, pending any \nde novo request, the associate judge's proposed order is in full effect as an order of the court (Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 201.013(a)). This legal mechanism is intended to gi ve \nimmediate effect to temporary rulings, while allowing a quick review by the district judge if a party is dissatisfied.  \nAn associate judge has authority to \"render and sign... a temporary order\" in a \nSAPCR or divorce case. Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 201.007(a)(14)(C) expressly so provides. The associate judge can also sign a final order if it is agreed in writing by all parties as to  both \nform and substance. In other words, the statute recognizes that a true agreed order (with all parties signing off) can be signed by the associate judge and will carry the same \nweight as if the district judge signed it. For contested matters, typically the associate \njudge issues a report and proposed order for the district judge to sign, unless no party objects (in which case the associate judge's order often effectively becomes final after the de novo period).  \nRequirements for Temporary Orders (Tex. Family Code \u00a7 105.001)  \nSection 105.001 of the Family Code governs temporary orders in suits affecting \nthe parent -child relationship. It broadly allows a court to make temporary orders for the \nsafety and welfare of the child (e.g., conservatorship, support, restraining certain behavior, etc.). However, it also imposes certain procedural safeguards. For example, except in emergencies, temporary orders (like those appointing conservators or ordering support) can only be issued after notice and a hearing.  \nNotably, a temporary order that excludes a parent from possession of or access to \na child (as happened here, since Charles was forced out of the home and effectively had limited access) cannot be rendered without a verified pleading or affidavit showing the \nrequisite facts (essentially a showing of immediate danger to the child). This is to ensure \na parent is not denied access without due process and evidentiary support. In our case, the initial February 1 hearing was tied to a protective order application,  so there likely were \naffidavits/pleadings on file \u2013 but whether evidence was presented is disputed. Regardless, \nthe overarching principle is that due process must be afforded in temporary orders.  M.2183 M.2183\nM.2183 M.2183 M.2183 M.2183",

      "text": "B. Agreed Orders and Rule 11  \nTexas strongly favors parties resolving issues by agreement, but any agreement \ntouching a pending lawsuit must satisfy Rule 11, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure to be \nenforceable. Rule 11 requires agreements to be either (1) in writing, signed by the parties or their attorneys, and filed with the court, or (2) made on the record in open court. An \"Agreed Temporary Order\" is essentially a Rule 11 agreement on the interim issues, \nincorporated into a court order. If one party does not actually consent or withdra ws \nconsent before the court renders the order, then there is no valid agreement to support an \nagreed order.  \nTexas case law is clear that a court cannot render a valid agreed judgment or \norder without the genuine consent of both parties at the time of rendition. If a party revokes consent or never consented in the first place, the agreed judgment is improper. As the Texas Supreme Court has held in Burnaman v. Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288 (Tex. 1951), a \njudgment purporting to be a consent judgment, but actually rendered without consent, is \nvoid. Similarly, in S&A Restaurant Corp. v. Leal , 892 S.W.2d 855, 857 (Tex. 1995),  the \ncourt confirmed that a party may revoke consent any time before judgment is rendered.  \nC.

ANALYSIS OF PROCEDURAL IRREGULARITIES  \nA. Failure to Follow Associate Judge's Explicit Procedures  \nThe February 1, 2024 Associate Judge's Report established a clear procedure for \nfinalizing the Temporary Orders. This procedure was not followed in several critical \nrespects:  \n1. Preparation by Wrong Attorney : The Associate Judge explicitly directed that \nDan Bacalis (Charles's attorney) would prepare the typed order within 20 days. Instead, Cooper L. Carter (Morgan's attorney) prepared the order. This is a direct \ncontravention of the court's instruction. The c ourt's designation of a specific \nattorney to draft the order was not a mere suggestion but a directive. When a court specifies which attorney will draft an order, it is typically to ensure fairness and balance in the drafting process. By having opposing counsel draft the order \ninstead, the court's intent was undermined, and the resulting document may \nreflect a bias toward Morgan's interests.  \n2. Missed Deadlines : The Associate Judge set clear deadlines: 20 days for \npreparation of the typed order (approximately February 21, 2024) and 30 days for a Motion to Sign if agreement could not be reached (approximately March 2, 2024). The final order was not prepared until  March 26, 2024 \u2013 approximately 54 \ndays after the February 1 hearing. This delay of nearly two months exceeds both \ndeadlines by a substantial margin. No extension of these deadlines appears in the \nrecord. The court's timeline was not merely  advisory; it was a binding directive \nthat established the parameters for finalizing the order. The failure to adhere to these deadlines constitutes a procedural irregularity that calls into question the validity of the resulting order.  M.2186 M.2186\nM.2186 M.2186 M.2186 M.2186",

      "text": "3. No Attorney Approval : The Associate Judge directed that each attorney should \napprove the order, with a 5 -day review period. By the time the order was \nprepared, Charles no longer had counsel of record. Dan Bacalis had withdrawn \nfrom representation and did not sign the final or der. This means the order was \nnever reviewed or approved by an attorney representing Charles's interests, as \nexplicitly required by the Associate Judge. The requirement for attorney approval serves an important purpose: ensuring that the written order accurately reflects \nwhat was agreed or ordered at the hearing. Without this safeguard, there is no \nassurance that the final document faithfully represents the court's rulings or any agreement between the parties. \n4. No Motion to Sign Hearing : The Associate Judge directed that if agreement \ncould not be reached on the form of the order, a Motion to Sign should be filed and set within 30 days. No such motion was filed, despite the fact that Charles objected to at least one provision (Paragraph 3) of the proposed order on March 14, 2024. Instead of following this procedure for resolving disagreements, \nopposing counsel and the court apparently attempted to force Charles's \nacquiescence through coercive means. The Motion to S ign procedure is designed \nto provide a formal mechanism for resolving disputes about the form of an order. By bypassing this process, the court denied Charles the opportunity to present his \nobjections in a proper procedural context.  \nThese procedural failures are not mere technicalities. They represent significant \ndeviations from the court's own directives and from standard legal practice. The Associate Judge's instructions were designed to ensure a fair and orderly process for \nfinaliz ing the Temporary Orders. By disregarding these instructions, the parties and the \ncourt undermined the integrity of the process and cast doubt on the validity of the resulting order.  \nB.

Heaton , 240 S.W.2d 288 (Tex. 1951) \u2013 a decades-old case still often cited for the \nproposition that a judge has no authority to impose an agreement on a party who has repudiated it prior to judgment). Here, Charles's actions are tantamount to having never truly c onsented or having repudiated any earlier tentative consent.  \nIn sum, the final Temporary Orders are built on a false premise of party consent. \nOn their face, they recite an agreement and show signatures, but the surrounding record shows Charles's signature and his attorney's signature is missing. This kind of discrepancy is something an appellate court or any reviewing court would look at with \ngreat concern. Facially, the order proclaims an agreement that did not actually exist \u2013 that \nis a strong indicator of invalidity. A judgment that misstates the existence of an agreement \nis at least voidable, if not void, because the court's authority to render that particular agreed judgment was never triggered by an actual agreement of the parties.  \nC. Non -Conformance to the Court's Actual Rulings \u2013 Possible Substantive Variances  \nAnother question is whether the March 26 order fails to conform to what the \nAssociate Judge ordered  on February 1. If the final written order includes provisions that \nwere never agreed to or never ruled on by the judge, it is improper. Charles's objection to Paragraph 3 suggests he believed that portion of the order was not agreed or not ordered on February 1. Indeed, reviewing the text of the Temporary Orders, Paragraph 3 (and related provisions) deals with the parents using the \"AppClose\" program for \ncommunication and sharing information. It is unclear if this specific requirement was \ndiscussed on February 1 or if it was an added term Carter inserted in the written draft. Often, such  app requirements are agreed to by parties or ordered by judges to facilitate \ncommunication. If Charles objected, perhaps he felt it was beyond what was decided at \nthe hearing.  \nFurthermore, initially, the Feb 1 report gave Charles access to the family \nresidence until March 1, 2024 and took the children out of their own home.

Perhaps most egregious, is that on March 6th, 2024, prior to this hearing \nbeing held, Mother locked Father out of the family residence.  \nSince the final order went beyond the scope of the February 1 hearing and  \nimposed new obligations not covered in the AJ's oral pronouncement, the proper course \nwould have been to litigate those terms (or at least for the judge to confirm both sides agreed). By unilaterally adding it and forcing Charles's signature, the order contains \nterms to which there was never a true assent or judicial determination. In Texas, a written \njudgment must conform to the court's oral rendition (or the parties' agreement). Whe n it \ndoes not, that portion of the judgment is subject to being set aside or reformed. Here, we lack a transcript of February 1, but given Charles's resistance and the blatant differences \nin the two reports, there is no agreement.  That means the final order, at least in part, does \nnot reflect the actual \"report\" of the judge but rather what opposing counsel wanted, \nwhich is highly prejudicial.  \nAdditionally, because the final order was delayed, by March 26 the Associate \nJudge did not personally \"render\" those orders \u2013 he had made recommendations on \nFebruary 1, but the actual signing on March 26 was by the Associate Judge. If the District \nJudge signed it believing it was agreed, when in fact it was not, then the District Judge was essentially misled. The district court has authority to enter temporary orders after an \nAJ's hearing, but if it's contested, the district court should know it's contested. Here, \nlabeling it \"Agreed\" circumvented any further hearing by the district court. That implicates due process again \u2013 Charles never had a de novo hearing because it was never \npresented as a contested matter; the \"agreed\" label short -circuited his ability to get the \nreferring court to hear his side.  \nIn conclusion on this point, the content of the March 26 order exceeds or deviates \nfrom what was legitimately agreed or ordered on the record, making those portions of the \norder unauthorized. An order that a court had no power to make (because the party di dn't \nconsent and no evidence was taken on that issue) is invalid. At the very least, it's an abuse \nof discretion to include terms not supported by the hearing. This is another reason the order is vulnerable to attack.  M.2191 M.2191\nM.2191 M.2191 M.2191 M.2191",

      "text": "D. Due Process Violations and Equity  \nBeyond the technical rule violations, the manner in which these temporary orders \nwere obtained raises serious due process concerns:  \n1. No Meaningful Opportunity to be Heard on Disputed Terms  \nCharles was not afforded a real chance to argue against Paragraph 3 or any other \ndisputed provision. The March 14 \"hearing\" was a farce in terms of due process \u2013 instead \nof an impartial judge considering his objection, he got an opposing counsel's ultimatum. \nThe next step should have been a hearing before the district judge (since the AJ process \nhad broken down into disagreement). By never allowing Charles a forum to voice why he objected (e.g.,  the changed dates, incorrect mailing address, etc. ), the court  denied him \nthe basic hearing on that issue. Temporary orders, while expedited, still require that each party can present their case on any point of contention. This did not happen.  \n \n2. Surprise and Lack of Notice  \nThe attempted  final order was pushed through on March 26 without prior notice \nto Charles of an \"entry\" setting. Typically, when an order is to be entered, especially if the \nform isn't agreed, the party is entitled to notice  when the judge will sign it and what \nversion is being submitted. Here, Charles was ambushed with a sign-now scenario. That \nis arguably a violation of local rules or at least the spirit of Rule 305, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, which contemplates notice to all parties of the presentation of a judgm ent for \nsigning if not all parties have approved it. In Page v. Sherrill , the Texas Supreme Court \nvoided a temporary custody change that was done ex parte without notice. While our case was not ex parte (Charles was physically present), the lack of formal notice and rushing is analogous to a notice failure. Due process requires notice reasonably calculated to inform the person of the action and an opportunity to respond. Charles's \"opportunity\" to respond \nwas truncated to mere minutes under threat.  \n3. Bias and Irregularity  M.2192 M.2192\nM.2192 M.2192 M.2192 M.2192",

It creates an appearance that the neutral arbiter (the judge) abdicated decision -\nmaking to one side's lawyer. The result is not a product of a court's reasoned decision or \nmutual consent, but essentially the wish list of one party imposed as an order. Courts \nhave inherent authority to sign orders, but they should draft or carefully review them \u2013 not just sign whatever one lawyer puts in front of them without the other 's approval. If the \nMarch 14 report notes were indeed by Carter, the Associate Judge should not have relied \non those as if they were the AJ's own findings. This informality undermines confidence \nthat the order was the result of a fair process.  \n \n4. Infringement on Parental Rights without Due Course  \nThe temporary orders severely restricted Charles's rights (requiring him to leave \nthe marital home, giving Mother primary custody, supervising exchanges, etc.). Such significant deprivations, even temporarily, demand scrupulous adherence to procedure. By cutting procedural corners, the court potentially violated Charles's constitutional right \nto due process. The Texas Family Code's requirement of affidavits for excluding a parent \n(Fam. Code \u00a7105.001(c)) is one manifestation of due process protection. If those \nrequirements were not strictly met or if the evidence was lacking (Charles alleges no evidence was presented on February 1 to justify kicking him out and giving mom full custody), that initial order itself was problematic. Compounding that with an improper finalization process makes it worse. Essentially, Charles and his children were subject to \na significant custody determination without the full protections of a proper adversarial \nhearing or a proper agreed resolution \u2013 a hybrid worst -of-both: no heari ng, and no \ngenuine agreement. Such a result is fundamentally unfair. When taken into consideration \nthat Charles needed the family home to operate his usual course of business, this makes \neven less sense and raises eyebrows as to how the mother was able to get away with such \nconduct.  \nEquity and good conscience would call for such an order to be set aside.

Here, the temporary orders process was tainted start \nto finish \u2013 from the lack of evidence at the outset (if Charles's earlier contentions are \ncorrect), to the failure to follow the AJ's procedures, to the coercion in  obtaining \nsignatures. There is a strong argument that Charles was denied due process, and thus the order is voidable on that independent basis. In some circumstances, a due process violation can render an order void (for example, an order issued without notice or jurisdiction is void). While Charles was present in the case (so jurisdiction over him \nexisted), the manner of depriving him of rights without a fair hearing could be deemed \nvoid as a violation of constitutional due process. This is especially true if we analogize to cases where a court had jurisdiction but acted in a way that violated a party's constitutional rights \u2013 courts have not hesitated to grant mandamus or other relief in such \nscenarios because the usual deference to trial court discretion does not extend to ignoring \nfundamental rights.  \nE. Are the March 26, 2024 Temporary Orders Facially Void?  \nConsidering all the above, we assess whether the final Temporary Orders can be \ndeemed facially void (void on their face) or at least voidable and subject to being vacated.  \nAn order is \"void\" (as opposed to merely voidable) if the court that rendered it \nlacked jurisdiction or authority or if it violates a fundamental jurisdictional requirement. Typically, errors in following procedure make an order voidable (to be corrected on direct appeal or by motion), not outright void. However, Texas law provides that agreed judgments entered without consent are void because the court had \"no power to render\" \nan agreed judgment absent an actual agreement. In this case, the 322nd District Court had \nsubject matter jurisdiction over the divorce/child case and personal jurisdiction over the parties, so jurisdiction in the traditional sense is not at issue. But did the court have authority to render the particular order it rendered? That is que stionable, because the \ncourt believed it was entering an agreed temporary order \u2013 an act that is only authorized \nif all parties truly agreed. Since Charles's consent was not valid, the court's act of signing an agreed order was beyond its lawful authority (it could have held a contested hearing or sent it back to the AJ, but it could not force an agreement).

The face of the order proclaims \nthat consent, but the supporting record contradicts it.  \nWhen determining facial voidness, courts normally look at the judgment roll or \nthe order itself and related documents. Here, the face of the order contains an internal inconsistency: it says both parties agreed and evidenced by signatures, but one attorney's signature is missing and we know one party's signature was coerced. Admittedly, \ncoercion is an extrinsic fact (not evident solely from the document). However, the \nabsence of Charles's attorney's approval is evident from the order itself \u2013 any reader can  \nsee one side's attorney did not sign. That is a facial defect in an \"agreed\" order. One could say the order is void on its face because it recites a non -existent agreement and because it \nwas entered in violation of the statute that requires all parties' written agreement for an associate judge to sign a final order. (Although a temporary order doesn't require written agreement of all parties to be signed by an AJ, in this case the order explicitly relies on supposed agreement.) \nEven if a court hesitates to label it \"void,\" it is unquestionably voidable for abuse \nof discretion and should be vacated on a direct attack. The trial court's failure to follow its own procedures and the statutory framework is a clear abuse of discretion.  Few scenarios \nfit the definition of an abuse of discretion more squarely than a judge signing an order \nthat one party's attorney never approved and that one party objected to and only signed \nunder threat.

Vacating the Temporary Orders \u2013 Mandamus Relief  \nBecause these are temporary orders in a family law case, they are not appealable by ordinary means. Texas law is clear that temporary orders in family cases cannot be challenged by interlocutory appeal. See Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 105.001(e) (\"Temporary orders rendered under this section are not subject to interlocutory appeal.\").

Clear Abuse of Discretion : As detailed above, the trial court clearly abused its \ndiscretion by:  \n\u2022 Failing to follow the Associate Judge's explicit procedures for finalizing the order  \n\u2022 Entering an \"agreed\" order without valid consent from both parties  \n\u2022 Allowing procedural irregularities that violated due process  \n\u2022 Permitting coercion to obtain a party's signature  \n2. No Adequate Remedy by Appeal : Since temporary orders are not appealable, \nCharles has no adequate remedy by appeal. He would have to wait until a final decree is entered to challenge these orders on appeal, by which time the harm from the improper temporary orders would be irreparable . The children's living \narrangements, Charles's access to them, and other important matters would be \ngoverned by invalid orders for months or even years while the case proceeds to \nfinal judgment. \nTexas courts have consistently granted mandamus relief in family law cases where \ntemporary orders were entered improperly. For example, in In re Stearns, 202 S.W.3d 414 (Tex. App. \u2013Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, orig. proceeding), the court granted mandamus \nrelief where the trial court's temporary orders effectively changed custody without proper notice or evidence. Similarly, in Page v. Sherrill , 415 S.W.2d 642 (Tex. 1967), the Texas \nSupreme Court granted mandamus relief where a temporary custody order was issu ed \nwithout notice and hearing, violating due process.  \nIf the order is truly void (as opposed to merely voidable), mandamus relief is even \nmore appropriate.

Alternative Remedies  \nIn addition to mandamus relief, Charles might consider the following alternative \nremedies:  \n1. Motion to Vacate or Set Aside : Charles could file a motion in the trial court \nasking the judge to vacate or set aside the temporary orders based on the procedural irregularities and lack of valid consent. While this approach has the \nadvantage of giving the trial court an opportunity t o correct its own error, it may \nbe less effective if the trial court is unwilling to acknowledge the problems with the order.  \n2. Motion for Reconsideration or New Trial : Charles could file a motion for \nreconsideration or new trial on the temporary orders. This would allow him to present evidence of the procedural irregularities and coercion. However, there is no guarantee that the trial court would grant such a motion, a nd the time for filing \nmay have already expired.  \n3. Motion for Further Temporary Orders: Charles could file a motion for further temporary orders, essentially asking the court to revisit the custody and \npossession arrangements. This would not directly challenge the validity of the \nexisting orders but could provide an opportunity to modify them. The disadvantage is that it would not address the underlying procedural problems.  \nOf these alternatives, mandamus relief is likely the most appropriate and effective \nremedy given the nature of the procedural irregularities and the fact that temporary orders are not appealable. A petition for writ of mandamus would allow an appellate cou rt to \nreview the process by which the temporary orders were obtained and, if appropriate, to \nvacate them and direct the trial court to conduct proper proceedings.  \nVI.

Failure to follow the Associate Judge's explicit instructions regarding who would prepare the order, the timeline for preparation, and the requirement for attorney approval;  \n2. Lack of valid consent to support an \"agreed\" order, as evidenced by Charles's missing signature on the February 1 report, his explicit objection to Paragraph 3 on March 14, the coerced nature of his signature on March 26, and the absence of \nhis attorney's approval;  \n3.

This consolidation prejudiced \nRelator by delaying urgent child custody and support resolutions, eliminating \nstrategic advantages, pre -empted appellate review, and  caused further procedural \nconfusion, violating Tex.

The panel\u2019s denial conflicts with controlling authority and overlooks \ncritical facts established in the mandamus record.  \nThe panel\u2019s denial fails to recognize the trial court\u2019s abuse of discretion and \nthe resulting prejudice, as evidenced by the mandamus record and established Texas law.  \nA. The trial court abused its discretion by consolidating without sound legal \nbasis.  \n \nTex. R. Civ. P. 174(a) permits consolidation only when cases share common \nquestions of law or fact and when it does not prejudice any party. The trial court\u2019s \nsua sponte consolidation of Relator\u2019s SAPCR with an unprosecuted divorce case \nlacks a sound legal basis and contravenes this rule. In Dal -Briar Corp. v. Baskette , \n833 S.W.2d 612, 615 (Tex. App. \u2014El Paso 1992, no writ), the court held that \nconsolidation constitutes an abuse of discretion if it prejudices a party, such as by \ndelaying urgent proceedings or creating procedural confusion.

For example, the SAPCR\u2019s unresolved \ncustody issues, critical to the children\u2019s stability, are stalled by the divorce case\u2019s procedural c omplexities, causing ongoing harm to their welfare.  \nFurthermore, in Lone Star Ford, Inc. v. McCormick , 838 S.W.2d 734, 737 \n(Tex. App. \u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 1992, writ denied), the court affirmed that while \ntrial courts have broad discretion to consolidate cases with common issues, such \ndiscretion is abused if consolidation results in prejudice to a party. In that case, the \ncourt found no abuse because the appellant failed to demonstrate prejudice, noting, \n\u201cAppellant  failed to demonstrate how it was prejudiced as a result of \nconsolidation.\u201d Id. at 738.

This delay distinguishes the present case from Lone Star Ford and \nunderscores the trial court\u2019s abuse of discretion, as the issues still remain \nunadjudicated.  \nMoreover, Womack v.

By consolidating Relator\u2019s \nSAPCR with a stalled divorce case without notice, hearing, or resolution of a \npending Rule 12 motion and objection, the court flouted due process and Texas \nFamily Code \u00a7 153.002\u2019s mandate to prioritize children\u2019s best interests.

      "text": "19 C. ABUSE OF DISCRETION\nImmediately after submitting his first mandamus petition, Mr. Myers was \nserved with an ORDER GRANTING CONSOLIDATION. (MR 15)  This motion, \nwhich was used as a barrier to relief, was granted sua sponte by the same court \nwho just declined to hear an emergency TRO  before it . \nThe record leaves no doubt that Respondent\u2019s decision to consolidate the \ncases without notice or a hearing was a gross departure from the fair administration \nof justice . It is difficult to imagine a more textbook abuse of discretion: a contested  \nmotion was granted sua sponte , with no opportunity for the opposing party to be \nheard. This is not a close call or a minor procedural wrinkle. The facts speak for themselves \u2013 equity, due process, and basic procedural fairness were all denied in \none fell swoop.  The only question is whether they will continue to be ignored.  \nTexas courts have held that a trial court clearly abuses its discretion by \ngranting a contested motion sua sponte without providing notice or a hearing. In \nD.A. Buckner Constr., Inc. v. Hobson, for example, the trial judge entered an order\n(imposing sanctions) even though the affected party had no notice or opportunity to \nbe heard. The court of appeals declared that order void  and emphatically stated: \n\u201cRespondent\u2019s order was without notice or hearing. Under these circumstances, the \ntrial court\u2019s order is void, and mandamus will lie to vacate such an order.\u201d  Such is \nthe case here. Therefore, the law should apply equally.

Am., Inc ., 244 S.W.3d \n840, 845 (Tex.2008) (orig.proceeding).  A party establishes that no adequate \nappellate remedy exists by showing it is in real danger of losing its substantial \nrights. Perry v. Del Rio , 66 S.W.3d 239, 257 (Tex.2001) (orig.proceeding). As \nrepeatedly stated throughout these proceedings, Relator has been deprived of the \nmost fundamental rights one can have: the right to possess and protect his home, \nand the right to care for, maintain contact with, and make decisions regarding his minor children. These rights are not abstract \u2014 they are protected by the U.S. \nConstitution, the Texas Constitution, and longstanding precedent . \nE. ONGOING AND IRREPARABLE HARM  \nThe Texas Supreme Court has repeatedly reaffirmed that \u201ca parent\u2019s rights to \nthe care, custody, and control of their children are constitutional in nature and must be afforded heightened protection.\u201d In re C.J.C. , 603 S.W.3d 804, 809 (Tex. 2020).  \nLikewise, property rights \u2014 including the right to remain in and possess one\u2019s \nhome \u2014 are protected under Article I, Section 19 of the Texas Constitution and the \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

For all \nreasons incorporated herein, Mandamus should be issued , as deprivation is \nongoing, and will occur until justice is rightfully served.  \nRelator has clearly established the Respondent\u2019s consolidation was both \nprocedurally improper, and prejudicial. For all reasons incorporated herein, the  \ncourt should uphold Texas precedent, and issue mandamus relief to restore justice \nto these proceedings.  \nCONCLUSION  \nWith a prima facie showing of systemic abuse laid bare across the trilogy of \nmandamus petitions now before this Court, it is no longer credible to characterize \nthe lower court\u2019s conduct as isolated error. Two of the three heads of this \nprocedural dragon\u2014embodied by the 233rd, the 322nd, and this very Court\u2014have \nalready rendered per curiam denials, offering no explanation in the face of \ndocumented, unrebutted misconduct. The record in each petition stands \nunopposed. No adversary response has been filed. No evidentiary challenge has \nbeen made. The silence against Relator\u2019s claims is not merely strategic\u2014it is \ntelling. A dangerous precedent is being forged in silence.

This SAPCR is intentionally filed as a new, separate case , rather than under the \nexisting divorce cause, due to unique procedural defects in that divorce proceeding that have left \nthe children in legal and physical limbo. Immediate intervention  is required to protect the \nchildren\u2019s best interests. Below, I outline the compelling reasons \u2013 supported by law and the record \u2013 why this SAPCR must proceed separately  and be set for an emergency hearing  at \nonce, instead of being merged into the stalled divorce case. \nA. Failure of Opposing Party to Prosecute\n1. The divorce Petitioner has wholly failed to prosecute the divorce, leaving it in\nprocedural limbo.  Over a year has passed with no meaningful activity toward a final resolution. \nNotably, after the divorce case was removed to federal court and later remanded, Petitioner \nnever filed the required certified Order of Remand or gave notice of remand  as mandated by \nTexas Rule of Civil Procedure 237a. Rule 237a obligates the removing party to promptly file the \nfederal remand order with the state clerk and notify all parties, after which any defendant has 15 \ndays to answer . Petitioner\u2019s omission  of this required step has left the state court record \nincomplete and the case procedurally suspended. Indeed, due to Petitioner\u2019s inaction (and her 322-744263-23 FILED\nTARRANT COUNTY\n4/15/2025 10:28 AM\nTHOMAS A. WILDER\nDISTRICT CLERKM.2260 M.2260\nM.2260 M.2260 M.2260 M.2260",

In addition, Petitioner has ignored the Texas Supreme Court\u2019s time standards  for\ntimely disposition of cases . A divorce case is expected to be resolved within 12 months, yet \nPetitioner has made no effort to advance it. She has not set a trial or even a status conference; she \nhas allowed critical deadlines to lapse. This lack of diligence violates the duty to prosecute one\u2019s claims and warrants dismissal for want of prosecution. In fact, Respondent has been forced to file a Motion to Dismiss for Want of Prosecution (pending before the Court) detailing Petitioner\u2019s complete failure to move the case forward. This also remains un-responded to. \nPetitioner\u2019s inaction has left the family with no active forum  to address urgent child- related \nissues. Therefore, a separate SAPCR  is necessary to provide a functioning vehicle for relief. \nThe children cannot wait  for the Petitioner\u2019s  indifference or strategic delay to abate.  \nB. Failure to Oppose Any Relief (Legal Concession)\n3. Throughout the divorce case, Petitioner has not opposed or responded to any of\nRespondent\u2019s filings , motions, or claims for relief. She and her counsel have remained silent in \nthe face of serious allegations and requests, effectively conceding the merits  of those issues \nunder Texas law. Respondent has raised grave claims of fraud, perjury, deception, and child neglect  against Petitioner in his pleadings, yet Petitioner\u2019s counsel has filed no response or \ndefense to these claims . Respondent also served discovery and Requests for Admissions which \nwent completely unanswered , resulting in deemed admissions. He even filed a motion to \ncompel discovery, which Petitioner again did not oppose , though unfortunately no hearing has \nyet been held . Moreover, when Respondent moved for other interim relief (including return to \nthe family home and expanded access to the children), Petitioner filed no opposition.

For example, in the \nsummary judgment context, if a nonmovant files no response, the court may accept the movant\u2019s \nasserted facts as uncontroverted and render judgment if entitlement is shown; issues not timely raised in a written response are waived; see Tex.

She has never disputed that Respondent should be\nallowed to return home or see his children \u2013 in fact, she has not opposed any relief requested. This silence should be treated as acquiescence. Accordingly, there is no reason to keep the children waiting in the paralytic divorce case when no one is even arguing against  the relief \nRespondent seeks in this SAPCR.

The undisputed evidence is that the children are suffering due to \nRespondent\u2019s forced absence from the home. In the months since he was excluded, the children\u2019s \nwell-being has precipitously declined: they have fallen behind in school, missed critical medi cal \nand dental appointments, and have been emotionally traumatized by the sudden and prolonged separation from their father. No party\u2014not even Petitioner\u2014has asserted that the children would be anything but better off if their father could return to care for them. No one has argued against Respondent\u2019s return to the home or his involvement in the children\u2019s daily life. It is axiomatic that the best interest of the children is the paramount concern in any case affecting the parent -\nchild relationship. See Tex. Fam.

Here, it is unquestionably in the children's best interests to have their loving father\nback in their daily lives without further delay. Texas public policy explicitly states that children should have frequent and continuing contact with parents who have demonstrated the ability to act in their best interest. See Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 153.001(a)  (declaring the public policy of \nTexas to ensure frequent contact and shared duties between parents and children following separation); Lenz , 79 S.W.3d at 14\u201315 (affirming that Texas policy favors maintaining \nfrequent and meaningful parental involvement in a child's life).  \n9. Respondent has demonstrated throughout these proceedings that he is a caring, fit\nparent whose presence provides the children with stability, support for their education and health, and emotional security. By contrast, the children\u2019s current situation\u2014living apart from Respondent for no substantiated reason\u2014is destabilizing and harmful. Texas courts recognize the urgency of child custody matters and have repeatedly underscored that \u201cjustice demands a speedy resolution of child custody and child support issues.\u201d  In re Tex. Dep\u2019t of Fam. & \nProtective Servs. , 210 S.W.3d 609, 613 (Tex. 2006) (orig. proceeding) (quoting Proffer v. \nYates , 734 S.W.2d 673, 674 (Tex. 1987)). Simply put, the children\u2019s needs cannot wait on \nprocedural formalities or a dormant divorce case. Their welfare requires this SAPCR to be heard immediately so that orders can be promptly put in place to reunite them with their father and address their academic, emotional, and medical needs. No statute or rule forbids initiating a separate SAPCR when it is necessary to protect children's best interests. Indeed, Tex. Fam.

See Lenz, 79 S.W.3d at 14\u201315 (holding courts must prioritize swift judicial actions in custody matters, protecting the best interests of children). \nD. Fraud and Perjury Render the Prior Orders Void\n10. The orders entered in the divorce case that currently keep Respondent out of the home\nand away from the children were obtained through fraud, misrepresentation, and even \nperjury . Because those orders were procured by wrongful means, they are void ab initio  and \ncannot be permitted to stand in the way of this SAPCR. Texas law does not tolerate court orders obtained by trickery or false pretenses. Notably, the temporary orders in the divorce (signed January 16, 2024 and later on March 14, 2024) were presented to the Court as \u201cagreed\u201d orders, yet Respondent never agreed to them  and never signed them. In fact, Respondent had \nexpressly opposed the relief in those orders. The \u201cagreement\u201d was a fiction created by Petitioner\u2019s counsel. The record reflects that Petitioner\u2019s counsel drafted and submitted those orders without Respondent\u2019s consent or signature , and which reference a hearing not found on \nthe docket. This is a textbook example of a fraud on the court . A judgment or order entered as \n\u201cagreed\u201d when one party actually objected is void. The Texas Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Burnaman v. Heaton is directly on point: when a trial court knows a party does not consent to a purported agreed judgment, it must refuse to sign it; any judgment rendered under such circumstances \u201cis void .\u201d Burnaman v. Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 (Tex. 1951). \n11.Here, the court was misled \u2013 it was never disclosed that Respondent vehemently\ndisagreed. Without such consent the judgment is void. The law will not give effect to a \u201cparty\u2019s consent\u201d that was never actually given. Moreover, the way  those orders were obtained M.2265 M.2265\nM.2265 M.2265 M.2265 M.2265",

For example, in her Application for \nProtective Order and supporting affidavit, Petitioner grossly misrepresented the facts, painting Respondent as a danger without evidence. She alleged incidents that never occurred or twisted mundane events into false claims of \u201cfamily violence.\u201d These misrepresentations were later exposed, and Petitioner has never attempted to prove them in any evidentiary hearing. Petitioner\u2019s intent was plainly to deceive the Court into granting her sole occupancy of the home and custody of the children. Indeed, Respondent\u2019s pending Motion to Dismiss details how Petitioner \u201cknowingly made and presented fraudulent claims to the Court regarding Respondent\u2019s property, with the intent to deprive him of his interest in his home\u201d , and how \nshe acted with intent that \u201cthese false claims be given the same legal effect as valid court orders, misleading the Court and causing Respondent to be wrongfully deprived of his home and livelihood.\u201d  \n12. These strong findings, which stand uncontroverted, show that the prior orders were\nprocured by fraud and deception. Under longstanding Texas precedent, any order obtained by \nextrinsic fraud  (fraud that effectively prevents a fair presentation of the case) is void and a \nnullity . See King Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman, 118 S.W.3d 742, 751\u201352 (Tex. 2003) (judgment \nobtained by fraud can be set aside; only extrinsic fraud \u2013 such as keeping a party away from court or concealing critical facts \u2013 justifies relief) .  \n13.Here, Petitioner\u2019s fraud was extrinsic in that it kept Respondent from participating\nfully  (the \u201cagreed\u201d order ploy) and kept the Court from learning the true facts .

They should carry no weight and pose no obstacle to granting relief in this \nnew SAPCR. This Court not only has the authority to declare such orders void, it has a duty to \ndo so in order to prevent manifest injusticec . See Burnaman, 240 S.W.2d at 291. By proceeding \nwith a fresh SAPCR, the Court can consider the issues regarding the children de novo, on truthful evidence, untainted by the false premises of the earlier orders. Equity regards as done that which ought to have been done \u2013 the Court should restore Respondent , CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, \n(Petitioner in the new cause) to his rightful place in the home and children\u2019s lives, as if the fraudulent orders had never been entered. \nE. Restoring the True Status Quo of the Family\n15.Relief in this SAPCR is also warranted to restore the status quo  that existed before\nPetitioner\u2019s improper actions. The \u201clast actual, peaceable status quo\u201d in this family was \nRespondent living in the home with the children, as a present and active father. That was the reality until late 2023, when Petitioner \u2013 through unilateral false allegations \u2013 removed Respondent from the household. Texas law holds that the purpose of temporary orders and injunctive relief is to maintain or restore the status quo pending trial. See In re Shifflet, 462 S.W.3d 528, 537 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2015, orig. proceeding) (courts aim to restore the last peaceable status quo pending final trial). \n16.Here, the true status quo ante  was the intact family unit with Respondent present.\nThe situation now \u2013 Respondent barred from the home and children \u2013 is a drastic deviation from that status quo, achieved only by contested court orders that, as shown, lack validity.

For \nexample, when one party\u2019s unilateral conduct disrupts a long-standing living arrangement, courts recognize that stability must be restored for the benefit of all, especially the children. See Smith v. McDaniel , 842 S.W.2d 7, 12 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas 1992, no writ) (courts should preserve or\nrestore the conditions that existed prior to the controversy to protect the children\u2019s routine and sense of security). Here, restoring the status quo means allowing Respondent back into his home and parenting role immediately . That was the \u201clast peaceable\u201d situation  before litigation \n\u2013 a state in which the children were thriving. Notably, the findings in the temporary ordershearing (held without Respondent) even indicate there were no findings of any imminent harm if Respondent were present; the exclusion was based solely on Petitioner\u2019s requested relief, not on proven misconduct by Respondent.  \n17. Thus, there is no safety-based reason to maintain the current deviation from the norm.\nBy contrast, there are powerful reasons to return to normalcy: the children\u2019s suffering would be alleviated, and the family\u2019s balance and stability would be reestablished. \n18. In short, equity demands that we \u201cundo\u201d  the improper disruption caused by\nPetitioner\u2019s actions. This SAPCR allows the Court to do exactly that \u2013 to realign temporary orders with reality and justice. In re Shifflet instructs that the last peaceable status quo should be restored pending trial . The last peaceable status was Respondent in the home; restoring that \nwill harm no one (again, even Petitioner did not claim any abuse or violence requiring exclusion \u2013 her application acknowledged no recent violence, only vague fears). Maintaining the currentsituation, by contrast, gravely harms the children and prejudices Respondent\u2019s relationship with them.

The Court\u2019s Duty to Act Without Delay for the Children\u2019s Welfare\n19.By accepting this SAPCR as a separate case, the Court can fulfill its paramount duty\nto protect the children\u2019s welfare without procedural delay . Courts have a sacred obligation  \nto put the interests of children above rigid procedural considerations, especially in emergencies. \nThe Texas Supreme Court has emphasized that trial courts must act immediately when children\u2019s physical or emotional well- being is at stake , even if procedural complexities exist. \nIn In re Tex. Department of Family & Protective Services , for example, the Supreme Court \nadmonished that delays in custody matters are intolerable, quoting with approval the maxim: \u201cJustice demands a speedy resolution of child custody and child support issues.\u201d  210 S.W.3d \n609, 613 (Tex. 2006). The high court in that case (a mandamus proceeding) required prompt action despite procedural entanglements, recognizing that a child\u2019s need for a stable, safe environment cannot be made to wait on protracted litigation maneuvers. \n20.Similarly, in Elizondo v. Monteleone , an appellate court noted that when a parent\nattempted procedural gambits to delay a custody determination, the court system should not allow those tactics to trump the child\u2019s immediate needs. Elizondo v. Monteleone , 96 S.W.3d 705, \n708 (Tex. App.\u2014Corpus Christi 2002, no pet.) (courts will not permit jurisdictional technicalities to delay emergency relief in a parent -child case). [( If citation is verified)] In that case, one party \ntried to remove the case to federal court and argued that the state court lacked jurisdiction to issue temporary orders during the interim. The court flatly rejected that ploy, holding that the state court must  act to protect the child and could later sort out jurisdiction, because the child\u2019s M.2269 M.2269\nM.2269 M.2269 M.2269 M.2269",

      "text": "welfare was paramount. The lesson is clear: procedural fencing cannot override the need for \nimmediate judicial action when children are suffering.  \n21.Here, Petitioner\u2019s inaction and the snares of the divorce case have already delayed\nrelief for far too long. The children have been without their father for several critical months of their development . The Court has the power \u2014and indeed the duty \u2014to cut through the \nprocedural morass  by creating a new SAPCR docket and promptly addressing the merits of \nconservatorship, possession, and access. There is no jurisdictional barrier to doing so: this Court has continuing jurisdiction over the children (by virtue of the ongoing divorce) and thus can hear a SAPCR involving them. Any concern about duplicitous litigation is mitigated by the fact that \nthe divorce case is effectively moribund; furthermore, Respondent will move to consolidate or \ndismiss the divorce once the SAPCR is in place, if appropriate. What cannot be allowed is more delay that leaves the children in a fractured situation. Our Courts are courts of equity as well as law, especially in family matters. When equity demands immediate intervention, the Court should not hesitate. As the Austin Court of Appeals observed, \u201cwhen the jurisdiction of the court has been properly invoked in matters affecting minor children, the court\u2019 s primary consideration is the best interest of the children, and the court may enter any order deemed necessary to protect and conserve the welfare of the child.\u201d  Elizondo, 96 S.W.3d at 708 (citing Tex. Fam. \nCode \u00a7\u2009105.001 on temporary orders for a child). In other words, once the Court is aware of a child in need, it must act, and act swiftly .  \n22. That is precisely the situation here. By accepting this SAPCR filing and setting an\nimmediate hearing, the Court will be performing its highest duty: safeguarding the children\u2019s wellbeing without further procedural impediment.

The Court should therefore promptly \ndocket this SAPCR as a new case and schedule an emergency hearing on temporary orders for the children. \nG. Protective- Order Application Confirms Respondent\u2019s Joint Ownership of the Home\n24. Even Petitioner\u2019s own filings acknowledge Respondent\u2019s legal right to return to the\nresidence. In her sworn Application for Protective Order (filed in September 2023), Petitioner \nexplicitly affirmed that the marital residence \u201c is jointly owned or leased by the Applicant and \nRespondent .\u201d \n25.This judicial admission is significant. It means that at the time she sought exclusive\nuse of the home, Petitioner conceded that Respondent is co -owner (or co -leaseholder) of the \nproperty. There is no dispute, therefore, that Respondent has an equal property interest and legal right to occupy the home . Petitioner cannot now contradict her own sworn statement by \nsuggesting Respondent has no such right. \n26. Why is this important? Because the prior orders granting Petitioner exclusive\npossession of the home (and excluding Respondent) stand in direct conflict with the parties\u2019 property rights and the status quo. Those orders were based not on any finding that Respondent lacked ownership or rights to the home, but presumably on a temporary  need for protection \n(which, as shown, was falsely claimed). With the exposure of Petitioner\u2019s allegations as false, there remains no lawful basis  to keep Respondent out of a home that he owns jointly. Texas M.2271 M.2271\nM.2271 M.2271 M.2271 M.2271",

Here, absent the now-questionable temporary orders, Respondent as joint owner would be free to live in his home. The Court should thus give weight to Petitioner\u2019s admission of joint ownership and recognize Respondent\u2019s unabated property right . This is yet another reason to allow the SAPCR to go \nforward: so that the issue of residency and possession of the home can be revisited in light of the true facts and rights of the parties. The protective order was leveraged into a settlement which both partie s did not agree to (as the record will show, if needed), meaning no long- term \nrestrictions were found warranted. What remains is a fit father who co -owns his home seeking to \nreturn  to his necessity to work and provide financially for the children . Petitioner\u2019s own \npleadings remove any doubt about his entitlement. Accordingly, the Clerk and Court should not hesitate to facilitate Respondent\u2019s return via new temporary orders in this SAPCR, as even Petitioner\u2019s sworn statements support Respondent\u2019s position . \nH.

      "text": "Finally, Respondent has filed a Rule 12 Motion  (Motion to Show Authority) in the divorce case, \nwhich is currently pending and further indicates why the existing case cannot properly proceed. \nIn that motion (filed September 20, 2024), Respondent challenged the authority of Petitioner\u2019s attorney of reco rd to act on her behalf.  \n28. This challenge was not made lightly \u2013 it is supported by evidence that Petitioner\u2019s\ncounsel never filed  the pleadings , is not authorized to practice in this matter under her current \nregistration, and may not even have a valid engagement with Petitioner. Notably, since that motion was filed, Petitioner\u2019s counsel has failed to respond to it or otherwise prove her authority . Rule 12 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provides that an attorney challenged by \nsuch a motion must appear and show authority to act  for the client, or else be struck from the \ncase. Petitioner\u2019s counsel has not met this burden. Instead, irregularities have abounded: at a recent hearing (on Respondent\u2019s motion to recuse), Petitioner\u2019s counsel appeared without \nhaving answered the Rule 12 motion , and the Court allowed her to argue on a motion she did \nnot respond to , but her authority remains in question.. Moreover, it came to light that Petitioner\u2019s \ncounsel has been unable to e -file pleadings on her client\u2019s behalf  because her electronic filing \naccount is in disarray (registered under a former employer\u2019s email at Cantey Hanger yet is signing pleadings for Marx, Altman, & Johnson) . In fact, the few documents \u201cfiled\u201d in the \ndivorce case on Petitioner\u2019s side were filed  by Roderick Marx, not by the attorney herself . And \ntellingly, Petitioner\u2019s counsel failed to file the Notice of Remand  after the federal court sent the \ncase back, leaving the case hanging indefinitely. All of this demonstrates that Petitioner\u2019s counsel is effectively not acting with proper authority or competence  in the divorce matter.  \n29.This is critical because if Petitioner\u2019s attorney lacks authority, then Petitioner is\nessentially unrepresented  in the divorce. Her pleadings (including the Original Petition for M.2273 M.2273\nM.2273 M.2273 M.2273 M.2273",

The entire divorce \nproceeding would be a nullity without an authorized petitioner or counsel \u2013 which is another reason it has stagnated. It would be unjust to make the childre n wait for months while this issue \nis sorted out. By contrast, in a new SAPCR, Petitioner can secure proper counsel or proceed pro se, but the Rule 12 quagmire in the divorce case can be sidestepped for now to get the children relief. The pending Rule 12 motion underscores that the divorce case is on unstable footing. It is procedurally snarled by questions of representation. On the other hand, Respondent is ready to proceed in the SAPCR immediately  \u2013 he, as the petitioner in the SAPCR, obviously has \nauthority to bring it, and he will serve Petitioner directly. If Petitioner\u2019s prior counsel truly has no authority, Petitioner will have to either hire new counsel or represent herself in responding to t he \nSAPCR, but at least the case will move forward . The Rule 12 fiasco in the divorce should not be \nallowed to delay relief for the children. Equity again favors moving to a forum (the SAPCR) where all parties before the Court are indisputably authorized and the merits can be reached without distraction.  \n30. In summary on this point, Respondent\u2019s Rule 12 motion (which remains unanswered)\nindicates that the opposing attorney \u201chas no authority to act for the party\u201d \u2013 a situation which, by rule, would mandate striking her pleadings and possibly dismissing the divorce. Rather than let the case devolve into that chaos (to the children\u2019s detriment), the Court should start fresh with this SAPCR. The integrity of the proceedings  will be ensured here, because all parties will be \nproperly before the Court. Respondent is confident that once this SAPCR is active, Petitioner will either appear on her own or with legitimate counsel and the issues can finally be adjudicated on the merit s. Until then, the divorce case cannot be trusted as a vehicle for relief due to the M.2274 M.2274\nM.2274 M.2274 M.2274 M.2274",

This factor strongly supports accepting the SAPCR as a \nstandalone action and granting the requested hearing and relief without delay. \nI.Conclusion\n31.For all the foregoing reasons \u2013 lack of prosecution in the divorce, Petitioner\u2019s waiver\nof opposition, the children\u2019s urgent needs, the void nature of prior orders, the necessity of \nrestoring the status quo, and procedural snares in the divorce case \u2013 Respondent respectfully urges the Clerk to file the enclosed SAPCR as a new cause of action, and requests that the Court set an immediate EX -PARTE hearing on temporary orders  in this SAPCR  to issue \ninjunctive relief immediately allowing acc ess back into the residency and children \u2019s lives. \nThe Court has abundant legal justification and equitable grounds to do so. Most importantly, the children\u2019s welfare compels immediate action , and the Petitioner will not be adversely \naffected by this decision , and has immediate housing options nearby available to her, \ncontrary to the undersigned.  Every factor discussed above converges on one truth: these \nchildren need their father back and need a stable, working court order to govern their custody and care \u2013 and they need it now, not months from now. By allowing this SAPCR to proceed separately, t he Court will cut the Gordian knot that the divorce case has become and will be able \nto issue orders truly serving the children\u2019s best interests forthwith . \n32. Respondent is prepared to appear for an emergency hearing on any date and time  the\nCourt can accommodate \u2013 preferably today. He is also prepared to file any additional supporting documents or evidence the Court may require. All necessary filing fees for this SAPCR are being paid, and service of process will be promptly effected on the opposing party.

If evidence or circumstances cast doubt on the attorney\u2019s authority, the presumption gives \nway and the attorney must prove actual authority. For example, an attorney who conducted a trial is presumed authorized to pursue an appeal, but that presumption can be rebutted with contrary evidence. Here, the  unusual facts surrounding Ms. Carter\u2019s involvement thoroughly rebut any \npresumption of her authority to represent the Respondent named in this matter, Morgan Michelle Myers, as detailed below .

A party in a suit or proceeding pending in a court of this state may, by sworn written\nmotion stating that he believes the suit or proceeding is being prosecuted or defended without \nauthority, cause the attorney to be cited to appear before the court and show his authority to act. \nThe notice of the motion shall be served upon the challenged attorney at least ten days before the hearing on the motion. At the hearing on the motion, the burden of proof shall be upon the challenged attorney to show sufficient authority to prosecute or defend the suit on behalf of the other party. Tex. R. Civ. P. \n3. Multiple red flags call into question whether Carter is authorized \u2013 or even genuinely\nacting \u2013 as Ms. Myers\u2019s counsel, justifying relief under Rule 12. Petitioner respectfully requests \nthat the court requires  RODERICK D. MARX and COOPER L. CARTER to appear and show \ntheir authority to represent MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS in this matter to clear up the ambiguity surrounding their representation. \nB. Pleadings Filed by Proxy\n4.Every filing attributed to Carter in this case was filed through another attorney, Roderick\nMarx, rather than by Carter herself. Mr. Marx is the founding partner of the MAJ firm Carter \nformerly worked for, and he submitted documents \u201con her behalf \u201d through the electronic filing \nmanager.  In effect, Carter has not personally prosecuted or defended anything \u2013 someone else is \nhandling the filings. This raises serious doubts about whether Carter is acting  as counsel or whether \nMrs. Myers\u2019s case is being carried (or neglected) by others without a clear designation. An attorney \nof record should be the one signing filings or at least directly supervising and endorsing them; if M.2292 M.2292\nM.2292 M.2292 M.2292 M.2292",

Such proxy filings strongly indicate that Carter may lack authority or engagement \u2013if she had authority, one would expect her direct parti cipation. Rule 12 is meant to prevent exactly\nthis sort of scenario where a suit might be conducted by someone without clear authorization. \nC. Employment/Firm Misrepresentation\n5. Carter\u2019s own public statements conflict with the representations made to the court about\nher role. While her pleadings continued to identify her as \u201cCooper Carter, Marx Altman & \nJohnson\u201d (with a MAJ email address), her initial response in the instant cas e was filed by Roderick \nD Marx, signed by Cooper Carter with the Marx, Altman & Johnson letterhead, and then claimed that Cooper L. Carter was retained in her individual capacity. Further:  \ni. Carter\u2019s public Facebook profile claims that she is no longer employed with Marx,Altman , & Johnson. \nii. Carter\u2019s public LinkedIn profile claims that she is no longer employed with Marx,Altman, & Johnson, and that she currently is employed at Cantey and Hanger, LLP. \niii. Carter\u2019s Electronic Filing Manager is registered under ccarter@canteyhangar.com .\nThis level of ambiguity is unnecessary and could be deliberate. In fact, Texas law requires attorneys \nto keep their State Bar profile updated with current employment information (Tex. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 81.115), which currently reflects her employment with Marx, Altman & Johnson.  So the\nquestion remains: why would Carter u pdate her Texas State Bar profile to reflect her current \nemployer but leave her social media and LinkedIn outdated?  \nD.

An attorney who is truly acting with a client\u2019s authorization \nis expected to pursue the client\u2019s interests diligently \u2013 e.g. respond to motions, appear at hearings, move the case forward. Carter, however, has been conspicuously silent. She has not plead any defense for her client, has not participated in any discovery.  \n7.Carter\u2019s abrupt appearance in this suit \u2014after months of silence in the divorce case \u2014\nmirrors the same confusion and procedural uncertainty that plagued the divorce action. This re -\nemergence appears tactical, not substantive, and should not obstruct the SAPCR\u2019s merits -based \nprogression. She has not mentioned anything about the children, their status, or how the current  \nsituation is what \u2019s best for them.  \n8. Carter\u2019s only notable action in the last six months related to her client has been to seek\nconsolidation of the SAPCR with the dormant divorce \u2013 essentially tethering the active custody \nmatter to a paralyzed divorce case which would further prejudice the children and delay the relief sought. \nII.Conflicts of Interest and Duty of Candor\n9.Misrepresenting one\u2019s role or affiliation can also create conflicts of interest  and\nbreaches of the duty of candor. If an attorney signs pleadings stating it was \u201cnecessary to retain their legal services\u201d while filing under a firm\u2019s name, it muddles who was retained  \u2013 the individual \nlawyer or the firm. This ambiguity can prejudice the client\u2019s interests and the opposing party\u2019s understanding of the representation. \n10. For example, in the case at hand the answer explicitly stated,  \u201cIt was necessary for\nMorgan [Michelle] Myers to secure the services of COOPER L.

Carter was operating  as a solo practitioner at that \npoint, the pleading arguably misled the court about who had been hired. This kind of \nmisrepresentation may violate the lawyer\u2019s candor toward the tribunal  (e.g. Tex. Disc. R. 3.03 \nor its equivalents) since it obscures a material fact \u2013 the lawyer\u2019s true status. Courts have held that \nlawyers must not omit facts necessary to keep statements from being misle ading. Failing to clarify \nthat the attorney is no longer with the named firm, it  could be seen as an omission that makes the \nfiling as a whole misleading.  \nIII. Unauthorized Filings and \u201cGhost\u201d Representation\n12. Having documents filed by another attorney who has not formally appeared is another\nproblematic practice. In proper procedure, every pleading or motion must be signed by an attorney of record \u2013 i.e. a lawyer who has made an appearance in the case.  Texas is clear: \u201cEvery \npleading of a party represented by an attorney shall be signed by at least one attorney of record in his individual name.\u201d  If Attorney A is counsel of record, it is improper for Attorney B (who \nhas not appeared in the case) to file documents on A\u2019s behalf without disclosure or court permission.  \n13. In the example above, the e- filing system\u2019s certificate shows \u201cRoderick Marx on\nbehalf of Cooper Carter\u201d as the filer , neither of which have formally appeared. This kind of \n\u201cghost filing\u201d blurs who is responsible for the document. Courts frown upon undisclosed involvement of attorneys  because it can circumvent accountability and confuse the record. At \nbest, it is an irregular practice; at worst, it could be seen as misrepresentation to the court. Here, given the same circumstances exist in the divorce case which has been abandoned, Pet itioner \nbelieves the situation leans more towards misrepresentation.

      "text": "6 14. Procedurally, if an attorney who is not counsel of record submits a filing, the court\nmay treat that filing as nullity  or require it to be redone. No appearance means no authority to \nact. From an ethical standpoint, using another lawyer to file pleadings without notice may \nimplicate rules against aiding in rule violations. Lawyers are forbidden from assisting or \ninducing others to violate the rules  (see Tex. Disc. R. 8.04(a)(1) . If Attorney A knows they \nshould appear officially but instead has Attorney B file a document to evade a procedural requirement, both attorneys tread on thin ice. They could be seen as trying to circumvent the rules of the tribunal. At a minimum, this lack of transparency undermines trust. The proper course would have been for the second attorney to file a notice of appearance (if joining the case) or for the original attorney to personally sign and file the pleading. Having someone \u201ccover\u201d a filing without formal acknowledgment is not a recognized practice. In short, any attorney involved in a case needs to either be of record or stay behind the scenes entirely . But if an \nattorney actually files or signs on behalf of the attorney of record, that person effectively steps into the role of counsel without the court\u2019s knowledge , which is improper. It is better to err on \nthe side of disclosure \u2013 either by formal association of that attorney or by avoiding involvement in filing . \n15. A s pointed out, the Petitioner believes that this is occurring because Carter\u2019 s EFM\naccount is setup under her prior employer\u2019s email address. So why not change it to reflect the correct address and file your own pleadings? Lastly, these same issues have been present in the divorce matter, and although Carter was served with a Rule 12 motion in that case on September 20, 2024, she has yet to clear up t his issue.  \nIV .

In the prior proceedings (Cause Nos. 322-744263-23 in the 322nd District Court), an associate judge signed a \"temporary\" order on March 14, 2024 that purported to be an agreement between the parties.

No amount of monetary compensation or later \nvisitation can make up for the lost time, missed milestones, and emotional bonding that has been denied for over a year. Courts have recognized that interference with custodial or visitation rights constitutes irreparable harm, as time lost with one's child is gone forever. The children are likewise losing the benefit of a father's love, guidance, and daily care \u2013 a harm that is unquestionably irreparable. If this wrongful separation continues, the risk increases that the parent -child bond could be permanently damaged. Reunification \nbecomes harder as more time passes; thus the urgency is extreme.  \n66. The children have been suffering confusion, instability, and emotional distress\ndue to the sudden absence of Petitioner and the drastic changes imposed by Respondent. They went from having both parents in their daily life to seeing only one parent, with no satisfactory explanation. Respondents' insertion of a new father- figure (Mr. Kazlauskas) \nhas exacerbated their confusion and anxiety. This kind of emotional turmoil in young children can lead to long-term psychological issues \u2013 a classic irreparable injury, as the court cannot later repair the trauma inflicted on a child's sense of security. Restoring Petitioner's presence is needed now to begin healing the damage and to reassure the children that their father has not abandoned them. The more time that passes, the deeper the potential harm to the children's mental health.  \n67. Petitioner's fundamental right to maintain his familial relationship with his\nchildren (protected by the U.S. and Texas Constitutions) is being violated. Such a violation is inherently irreparable. Deprivation of one's home \u2013 being ousted without cause \u2013 is also a profound personal harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law. M.2313 M.2313\nM.2313 M.2313 M.2313 M.2313",

If the Court does not act, the Petitioner  will continue to suffer intangible \nharms such as loss of income, anguish, and the erosion of his role as a father, none of which can be quantified or compensated later.  \nIV. THE RESPONDENT'S MISCONDUCT\nPerjury and Aggravated Perjury (Tex. Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 37.02\u2013.03) \n68. Texas law makes it a crime to make false statements under oath. Perjury\noccurs when a person, with intent to deceive, makes a false statement under oath in a proceeding where an oath is required. \n69. If the false statement is made in connection with an \"official proceeding\" and\nis material, it becomes Aggravated Perjury, a third -degree felony. In civil cases, \nknowingly submitting false affidavits or testimony can also constitute perjury and be treated as a fraud upon the court. Courts have recognized that false sworn statements in family law matters are serious misconduct, undermining the judicial process and potentially warranting sanctions or even criminal referral (e.g., Skepnek v. Mynatt, 8 S.W.3d 377, 381 (Tex. App. \u2013 El Paso 1999) (attorney sanctioned $30,000 for filing false affidavit).  \n70. Here, Respondent swore to multiple false statements under oath, meeting all\nelements of perjury and aggravated perjury.

      "text": "71. On December 18, 2023, Respondent filed a sworn \"Affidavit of Inability to\nPay\" court costs, claiming she had only $20 in her bank account. This statement was \nknowingly false. Just two days prior, Respondent had transferred $1,576.00 in marital funds to herself, as confirmed by text messages with her relative (Dan Branthoover) on December 16. She then appeared in court swearing she was penniless and could not afford the $400 filing fee. In that same affidavit, Respondent also lied that she alone paid certain expenses (two car loans and $800 rent plus utilities), when in fact Petitioner had been paying those bills; he continued to pay for the vehicles Respondent claimed to finance on her own. Bank statements and financial records will clearly establish this fact on the merits. Respondent's counsel has never refuted these facts. Thus, Respondent made multiple false statements under oath, meeting Penal Code \u00a7 37.02. Because these affidavits were filed in court proceedings and were material to the case (securing a fee waiver and influencing the court's actions), they also qualify as aggravated perjury under \u00a7 37.03. Each false statement was material to issues before the court (Respondent'sfinancial status and credibility), satisfying the materiality requirement.  \nFalse Statements in Protective Order Filings  \n72. Respondent submitted false sworn statements in her applications for\nprotective orders. Texas Family Code \u00a7 82.009 requires that an application for a temporary ex parte protective order \"contain a detailed description of the facts\" of alleged family violence and be sworn as true by the applicant. Respondent sought an ex parte protective order on or about Dec. 14, 2023, claiming abuse, yet on Dec. 22, 2023, she was photographed laughing and playing with the children alongside Petitioner \u2013 conduct wholly inconsistent with someone in fear of imminent harm.

The timing of these filings \u2014immediately after the discovery of Respondent's extramarital \nrelationship with Mr. Kazlauskas\u2014reveals their true purpose: not to protect against genuine violence, but to preemptively silence Petitioner and prevent him from exposing Respondent's infidelity and financial misconduct. By falsely claiming fear while simultaneously engaging in normal family activities with Petitioner, Respondent demonstrated the fabricated nature of her allegations.  \n75.

This coordinated sequence of events shows a \npremeditated plan to use the legal system as a weapon against Petitioner rather than as the shield of protection it was designed to be. \nControlling Law \n76. False testimony or affidavits in a civil proceeding can warrant severe\nconsequences. While the proper remedy for \"intrinsic\" fraud (false statements on issues litigated at trial) is often a new trial or sanctions rather than voiding a judgment, courts do not hesitate to act on clear perjury. Texas courts have inherent authority to address fraud on the court, and criminal prosecution for aggravated perjury is a possibility for egregious \nlies under oath. Indeed, aggravated perjury in court proceedings is a felony punishable by \n2\u201310 years' imprisonment (Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 37.03(b)). \n77. That is precisely what has occurred in this case, and Respondent should face\nsome consequences for her actions, but Petitioner believes that prolonged incarceration would not be in the best interests of his children, but that some form of legal repercussion is necessary to deter similar behavior in the future. She has made no effort to defend these claims, no effort to prosecute her case, and the Petitioner prays that this court realize the severity of this situation on those effected most: the children.  \nV.

Respondent's conduct constitutes a blatant violation of the \"best interest\"\nstandard mandated by Texas Family Code \u00a7\u00a7 153.001 and 153.002. Texas law declares it the public policy of this state to assure that children have frequent and continuing contact with parents who act in the child's best interest, to provide a safe and stable environment for the child, and to encourage both parents to share in raising the child. Moreover, the best interest of the child must always be the court's primary consideration in matters of conservatorship and access. Respondent has flagrantly defied these principles by prioritizing her extramarital relationship with Mr. Damen Kazlauskas over the emotional, psychological, and familial stability of her own children. \nOrchestrated Campaign of Deception at the Family's Expense \n82. The evidence reveals a disturbing pattern: Respondent orchestrated a\ncomprehensive campaign of deception that sacrificed her children's emotional well-being and family stability to pursue her extramarital relationship.

This behavior sends the children a disturbing message: that their father's role in their lives is interchangeable or unimportant.

It\ncontradicts the lodestone of the Family Code which is in the best interests of the children. \nThis is the more logical solution. If we pursued this route in the beginning, we'd already be divorced and the children's\nfinancial stability wouldn't have been sacrificed. There is no risk of danger. There is no risk of harm to the children. There\nis only the possibility of recovery. That is in their best interests.\nThere is no legal reason your client has to want me out of the house other than just that. She cannot unilaterally decide\nthat I agree to everything and then do as she pleases with my personal belongings and neglect the children in multiple\nareas.\nYour argument that I agreed to the orders in place falls flat on its face for many reasons which will not be repeated here.\nI am providing this notice strictly to comply with Local Rule 11(e) . I will proceed to present the application to the Court\nwithout further delay  due to the nature of the harm and urgency involved.\nIf you wish to discuss these matters, I'm happy to do so - otherwise I will inform the court that you do not agree to the\norders upon submission.\nThis situation cannot continue, and the alternatives that are available must be pursued to uphold the best interests of the\nchildren before any further damage to their well-being is sustained.\nRespectfully,\nCharles Dustin Myers4/12/25, 1:06 PM Gmail - Notice of Temporary EX-Parte TRO\nhttps://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ik=13839461f7&view=pt&search=all&permthid=thread-a:r5821386652075575501&simpl=msg-a:r579825187415709\u2026 1/4M.2334 M.2334\nM.2334 M.2334 M.2334 M.2334M Gmail \n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \u2022",

      "text": "FUDSTOP <chuckdustin12@gmail.com> Sat, Mar 22, 2025 at 3:17 PM\nTo: Cooper Carter <coopercarter@majadmin.com>, Morgan Wilson <morganmw02@gmail.com>\nCooper,\nPetitioner (your client) filed the original divorce petition in December 2023 in the 322nd District Court (Cause No. 322-\n744263-23). In that petition, she alleged false claims of family violence and sought a waiver of the 60-day waiting\nperiod for divorce, ostensibly to expedite temporary relief by labeling me as an abuser and claiming she had an active\norder of protection against me at the time of filing . \nOn February 1, 2024, a temporary orders hearing was held before an Associate Judge . The parties (through counsel)\nannounced an apparent agreement on temporary custody and other matters. The associate judge signed an \u201cAssociate\nJudge\u2019 s Report for T emporary Orders\u201d , titled as \u201cAgreed Temporary Orders.\u201d Importantly, this report did not itself\nconstitute a signed court order; instead, it outlined the agreed terms and directed further action before any order would\nbe final. Specifically, the report stated that Respondent's attorney (Dan Bacalis) would prepare a formal temporary\norders document, which would be prepared from 20 days from the date of signing, which would have been February\n22nd, 2024. It also required that both attorneys were to approve it to form within 5 days (have 5 days to approve\nthe order), and that if no agreement on form was reached, a motion to sign would need to be filed within 30 days .\nThe report noted that the parties\u2019 personal approval was not required for entry of the order, implying the attorneys\u2019 sign-off\nor a court motion would suffice. No district judge signed an order at that time \u2013 the associate judge\u2019s report was\nessentially a recommendation  to be formalized in a written order.  \nImmediately after the Feb 1 hearing, Respondent lost confidence in his attorney\u2019 s actions and fired his attorney.\nBelieving that the \u201cagreement\u201d did not reflect the child\u2019 s best interests or was entered under false pretenses (due to\nPetitioner \u2019s unfounded allegations), Respondent promptly withdrew his consent  to the announced terms. On February\n5, 2024, before any temporary order was signed by the court,  Respondent (now pro se) filed an Emergency Motion to\nReconsider and Vacate Temporary Orders . This motion put the court on notice that Respondent no longer consented  to\nthe supposed agreed terms and that he objected to any temporary order being entered as announced.  \nDespite this, the reconsideration was denied and no findings were ever entered. In fact, the order explicitly ordered\nRespondent to sign the orders to which he did not agree in violation of his own directives.\nTexas law is clear that an associate judge\u2019 s report or proposed order is not a final, enforceable court order\nunless and until it is adopted and signed by the referring court.  Under the Family Code, an associate judge may\nconduct hearings and recommend orders, but those recommendations remain subject to approval by the district court\njudge.  Section 201.011 of the Texas Family Code provides that an associate judge\u2019s report \u201cmay contain the associate\njudge\u2019s findings, conclusions, or recommendations and may be in the form of a proposed order\u201d. In other words, the\nassociate judge\u2019s report (even if titled \u201cTemporary Orders\u201d) is essentially a draft or advisory decision; it does not itself\ncarry the force of a court order until the proper procedures are completed.  \nFamily Code \u00a7 201.013 unambiguously outlines how and when an associate judge\u2019s proposal becomes an order of the\ncourt. If a party timely requests a de novo hearing by the referring judge, the associate judge\u2019 s proposed order may be\nenforced in the interim (except for certain matters) pending that hearing. However , if no timely request for a de novo\nhearing is filed, the statute states that \u201cthe proposed order or judgment of the associate judge becomes the\norder or judgment of the referring court only on the referring court\u2019 s signing  the proposed order or judgment.\u201d\nThus, absent a de novo appeal, an associate judge\u2019 s recommendation must be signed by the district judge  to have any\nlegal effect. Until the judge signs it, it is merely a proposed  order , not an actual court order.  \nBecause the February 1, 2024 temporary orders were never signed or adopted by the court, Respondent was (and is)\nunder no legal obligation to follow them, and neither party could properly enforce those terms through contempt or other\nremedies. A party cannot be held in contempt for violating a non-existent court order . Here, the \u201cAgreed Temporary\nOrders\u201d are, at most, an agreement between the parties that was not entered as a judgment. When Respondent withdrew\nhis agreement (as discussed below), even that contractual underpinning fell apart.  The Family Code\u2019s requirements were\nnot met, and thus the purported temporary orders are void ab initio  due to lack of rendition or entry by the referring\ncourt.  \nThe stage is thus set for this Court to intervene, because as of now , there is no operative temporary order governing\nthe child\u2019 s conservatorship or possession.   \nThe Purported Temporary Orders Are Void and Subject to Collateral Attack in This\nSAPCR 4/12/25, 1:06 PM Gmail - Notice of Temporary EX-Parte TRO\nhttps://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ik=13839461f7&view=pt&search=all&permthid=thread-a:r5821386652075575501&simpl=msg-a:r579825187415709\u2026 2/4M.2335 M.2335\nM.2335 M.2335 M.2335 M.2335",

      "text": "Because the February 1, 2024 temporary orders were never properly entered as a court order (and would have been\ninvalid if entered without consent - which is clearly the case here), they are void and can be attacked in this proceeding.\nGenerally, once a court renders a final judgment, parties are constrained to challenge that judgment on direct appeal or in\nthe original case; collateral attacks  on final judgments are disfavored. However, only a void judgment is subject to\ncollateral attack in a separate proceeding. Browning v. Prostok, 165 S.W.3d 336, 346 (Tex. 2005)  (\u201cBrowning v.\nPlacke , 698 S.W.2d 362, 363  (Tex. 1985)\u201d)\nIn this SAPCR, Respondent is effectively collaterally attacking  the temporary orders from the divorce case by asserting\ntheir invalidity . Such a collateral challenge is permissible here because those orders are void. As the Texas Supreme\nCourt has explained, \u201cOnly a void judgment may be collaterally attacked.\u201d Id.\nAccordingly, Respondent asks this Court to formally declare  that the March 26, 2024 \u201cAgreed Temporary Orders\u201d (and\nany interlocutory rulings associated with them) in Cause No. 322-744263-23 are void, of no effect, and not binding  on\nthe parties. This declaration will remove any doubt or argument by Petitioner that those terms still govern the parties\u2019\nrights. It will also foreclose any attempt to enforce or rely on those non-orders (for example, in claims of violation or in\narguing res judicata). The Court has the authority in equity and under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (T ex. Civ.\nPrac. & Rem. Code chapter 37) to declare the rights and status of the parties vis-\u00e0-vis that prior proceeding \u2013 particularly\ngiven that the SAPCR directly concerns the child who was also at issue in the divorce temporary orders. Granting such\nrelief is appropriate to prevent confusion and multiplicative litigation. Once the prior \u201corders\u201d are declared void, this Court\ncan proceed to issue fresh temporary orders for the child without any conflict or cloud from the divorce case.  \nIn sum, the prior temporary orders are a legal nullity and this Court should treat them as such. The Court\u2019s order declaring\nthem void will simply recognize the reality that, due to the procedural faults and lack of consent, those orders never had\nlegal existence. This clarification is critical to move forward in protecting the child\u2019 s welfare, as discussed next.   \nImmediate Emergency Relief Is Necessary to Protect the Child\u2019s Best Interest \nEvery day that passes without a valid temporary order is a day of potential harm or uncertainty for the child.  The\ncurrent situation \u2013 a divorce case stuck in limbo with no operative orders, and parents in dispute \u2013 is untenable for a\nchild\u2019s well-being. The child has effectively been living under an informal or contested arrangement since February 2024.\nPetitioner has acted as though she has primary custody under the (void) temporary orders, while Respondent has been\nsidelined and denied the normal possession or decision-making that a proper order (or a true agreement) would have\nprovided him. This dynamic, fueled by Petitioner\u2019s unproven allegations of family violence, has caused significant stress\nand instability for the child. Respondent fears that Petitioner is leveraging the appearance of an order to restrict his\ncontact with the child and to make unilateral decisions that are not in the child\u2019 s best interest. Meanwhile, the divorce\nproceeding has not moved forward to a final resolution \u2013 over 12 months  have elapsed since the March hearing, with no\ntrial setting in sight. This stalemate directly af fects the child: there is no clear court-sanctioned framework for\nconservatorship, visitation, or support, and your client has only introduced chaos into their lives.\nThis Court, now handling the SAPCR, has both the authority and the duty to step in and provide stability . Under T ex. Fam.\nCode \u00a7  105.001, \u201cthe court may make a temporary order, including the modification of a prior temporary order, for\nthe safety and welfare of the child,\u201d including orders for temporary conservatorship and possession.\nThe Family Code specifically empowers courts to act expeditiously to protect a child: if there is immediate danger to the\nchild\u2019 s physical or emotional health, the court can even issue temporary orders without notice (such as a temporary\nrestraining order) to address the emergency. Here, Respondent asserts that the child\u2019s emotional welfare is indeed in\njeopardy . The lack of a valid order has enabled Petitioner to marginalize Respondent\u2019s role in the child\u2019s life, purportedly\nunder the guise of the void temporary orders. Petitioner\u2019s false accusations of violence \u2013 never tested or proven in court \u2013\nhave created a pretext for her to limit Respondent\u2019s access. Consequently, the child is being unjustly deprived of time and\na relationship with Respondent, who has been a loving father with no history of abuse. This scenario is precisely what\nemergency temporary orders are designed to prevent. The Court should not allow a procedural quagmire to result in a\nchild effectively losing a parent or receiving inferior care.  \nMost importantly, the \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d is the paramount consideration in any conservatorship or\npossession decision. See 153.002 TEX. F AM. CODE.\nAll Texas courts must ensure that their orders first and foremost serve the child\u2019s best interest. By that standard,\ncontinuing under the shadow of void orders and parental discord is plainly not in this child\u2019 s best interest. Instead, the\nchild\u2019s best interest calls for fresh, valid temporary orders that set forth clear, fair, and safe arrangements for custody and\nvisitation while the parents\u2019  disputes are resolved. The Court should craft these orders based on current evidence and the\nchild\u2019s needs \u2013 not based on an outdated and unconsented plan from February.

      "text": "violence (made to gain a litigation advantage) should not dictate the child\u2019 s reality any longer, especially since those\nclaims have not been substantiated in any court hearing.  \nWhy your consolidation motion and response are insufficient, and will fail, or be\nmet with mandamus if granted (after reconsideration)\n Normally, even without continuing exclusive  jurisdiction, a prior pending  suit would require the new suit to be consolidated\nor abated (as discussed above with \u00a7\u2009 6.407 and dominant jurisdiction). The mother (divorce petitioner) could argue that\nthe original court \u201chas jurisdiction\u201d over the children by virtue of the pending divorce, so the SAPCR should not proceed\nseparately. However, the void nature of the prior temporary orders is a game-changer. If those orders are void, then\nthe original case has not effectively adjudicated anything regarding the children\u2019s current custody or support. The SAPCR\npetitioner can contend that because the prior orders are null, there is no valid existing order or active management of the\nchildren\u2019s case, and the new court is free to act in the children\u2019s best interests. This is the EXACT argument made . In\neffect, the argument is that the divorce case\u2019s jurisdiction over the children lapsed into dormancy or \u201cdormant jurisdiction\u201d\ndue to your failure to prosecute the case.\nIt\u2019s important to distinguish jurisdiction  from orders . The continuing jurisdiction doctrine  would typically prevent a\ndifferent court from issuing orders if a final order existed or if another court was actively handling the case. But here the\nSAPCR is filed in the same county as the divorce. There is no risk of two different counties competing; it\u2019s an internal\nissue. The SAPCR ef fectively asks the  court to take up a new cause number and to recognize that the old cause has\nstalled and its orders are void.  \nEVEN IF the void argument fails, there is another nuance to this area of law . Despite the lack of a final order, the\npending divorce still technically invokes the court\u2019 s jurisdiction over the children. Typically, the proper course is to revive or\ndismiss  the dormant divorce, rather than maintain a wholly separate SAPCR on the side. Texas courts adhere to the\nprinciple that the first suit filed (here, the divorce) should dominate; a later-filed suit concerning the same subject (the\nchildren) can be abated to prevent conflicting rulings. In fact, in  In re Shifflet , for example, a party attempted parallel\nlitigation regarding child custody, and the court emphasized that modifications must be filed in the court with jurisdiction\nover the original case\nThe only exception  to the one-court rule is narrow. Texas law does allow a court to lose dominant jurisdiction if the\nparty with the first suit proceeded in bad faith or the suit is not actively pursued. Both apply here. The first suit was\nunquestionably brought in bad faith, as the declaration of an active protective order being in ef fect against the\nRespondent was an intentional fabrication designed to provide your client with an advantage. Despite this, the\nTexas legislature should have prevented the first hearing from ever happening, because 6.405b of the T exas Family\nCode required your client to present the alleged order to the court BEFORE ANY HEARING. \nCONCLUSION \nThus, the SAPCR is appropriately before the court, and the only argument you made in your Response fails. The court\ndenied my attempt to open this separate suit, requiring me to file a 17 page argument as to why the case should be\naccepted, and then it was.\nSo your response effectively mirrors the first denial from the court,  which amounts to no response being filed at all.\nIt is clear you are not representing your client in a manner to uphold the law or the best interests of the children, but to\nonly appear when needed to obstruct the much needed justice that the children need and deserve.\nThis is my position.\nCharles Dustin Myers4/12/25, 1:06 PM Gmail - Notice of Temporary EX-Parte TRO\nhttps://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ik=13839461f7&view=pt&search=all&permthid=thread-a:r5821386652075575501&simpl=msg-a:r579825187415709\u2026 4/4M.2337 M.2337\nM.2337 M.2337 M.2337 M.2337",

I'm simply looking to do what's best for the kids and start working together\nto finish this so we can all move on with our lives.\nIf you have any suggestions, modifications, or alternative solutions, please feel free to reach out and let me know , or\nschedule a time and place to meet in person that best meets your schedule.\nRespectfully,4/12/25, 1:04 PM Gmail - Notice\nhttps://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ik=13839461f7&view=pt&search=all&permthid=thread-a:r2750686800934231680&simpl=msg-a:r825366924926110\u2026 1/2M.2348 M.2348\nM.2348 M.2348 M.2348 M.2348M Gmail",

The following reasons support this\nstatement:\n1. An objection to consolidation is already on file and remains unopposed. It cites controlling Texas precedent. Any\nsuggestion that consolidation is agreed upon or inevitable is misleading. Instead, she should properly file with the court\nwhy the consolidation is improper or at the very least argue against Petitioner's position.\n2. Ms. Carter has not fulfilled her obligation under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 237a to file a Notice of Remand. Until\nshe does, she is prohibited from proceeding or filing anything in the 322nd District Court as they currently do not have\njurisdiction over this matter until this obligation is fulfilled.\n3. Her authority to represent the Respondent remains under challenge pursuant to a Rule 12 motion filed September 20,\n2024. No hearing has been held, no written statement of authority has been filed, and no ruling has been made. Until\nresolved, Rule 12 bars her from participating in either proceeding.\n4.Ms. Carter has not prosecuted the case in the 322nd District Court in over eight months. This inaction has prejudiced\nthe Petitioner and delayed resolution of urgent matters af fecting the children.\n5. She has failed to file any objections, responsive pleadings, or legal arguments opposing the relief requested\u2014including\nthe Emergency TRO now pending.\n6. Rather than reaching out to Petitioner to resolve any scheduling conflict, Ms. Carter improperly attempted to influence\nthe court by email. This violates the spirit of cooperation required by the rules, particularly where her participation is\nprocedurally barred.\n7. Ms. Carter\u2019s conduct appears designed to delay relief and subvert the best interest of the children, despite her failure to\noppose the requested relief in any meaningful way.\n8. She has been provided with full notice of the Emergency TRO, the proposed order, supporting exhibits, and the time\nand location of presentment. She has no legal basis to subvert Petitioner's due process rights.\nIn summary, Ms. Carter has not provided anything of substance in either Court, has not prosecuted the case, has not\nargued on behalf of her client, or followed proper procedure.\nSimply labeling the opposition as pro se and claiming that the consolidation will be filed without disclosing the above facts\nis dishonest and should not be permitted as it will only cause further unnecessary delays to the relief being sought without\nany substance being provided.\nAgain, all of these points have been argued in both courts, and it is her duty as counsel to handle these matters in\naccordance with Texas Law.\nThese matters should be handled between the parties - not attempt to influence court staf f after hours.\nThe reason we are here in the first place is due to the above unanswered facts. Ms. Carter has had ample time to file an\nobjection, response, or counter argument, but has chosen not to do so.\nIt would've been far more appropriate for Ms. Carter to have reached out to me directly to discuss scheduling conflicts.\nPrior to the latest email, there was no indication Ms. Carter intended to participate at all despite being provided with all\nrelevant materials.3/29/25, 12:09 PM Gmail - ITIO MORGAN CHILDREN, CAUSE NO. 233-765358-25 CL-12105\nhttps://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ik=13839461f7&view=pt&search=all&permthid=thread-f:1827791302409332626&simpl=msg-f:182779130240933262\u2026 2/7M.2353 M.2353\nM.2353 M.2353 M.2353 M.2353",
