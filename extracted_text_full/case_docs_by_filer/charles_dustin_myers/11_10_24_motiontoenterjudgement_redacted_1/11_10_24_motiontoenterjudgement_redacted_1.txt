 I. TEXAS PRESCEDENT  REGARDING RECUSAL 
      1. In Texas, courts operate under a foundational presumption of impartiality. 
However, this presumption can be overcome if a movant presents compelling evidence of 
bias that fundamentally threatens due process. The Texas Court of Appeals has emphasized this requirement: bias must be so severe that it denies the movant a fair and impartial hearing. In Interest of E.R.C., 496 S.W.3d 270, 280 (Tex. App. —Texarkana 2016, pet. 
denied); Ex parte Ellis , 275 S.W.3d 109, 117 (Tex. App. —Austin 2008, no pet.). Simply 
put, due process mandates that all parties are heard by a neutral, detached judge. Brumit v. 
State , 206 S.W.3d 639, 644 -45 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006). This is not just a procedural   
necessity ; it’s enshrined in both the U.S. Constitution and the Texas Constitution.  
2. Texas courts use the "reasonable person" test to determine whether recusal is 
appropriate: Would a well- informed, impartial observer reasonably question the judge's 
impartiality based on the known facts? Hansen v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. , 346 S.W.3d 
769, 776 (Tex. App. —Dallas 2011, no pet.) (quoting Sears v. Olivarez , 28 S.W.3d 611, 615 
(Tex. App. -Corpus Christi 2000, order) (en banc) (internal quotations and citations 
omitted). If the answer is yes, recusal is warranted. In this case, numerous procedural 
missteps and decisions have seriously jeopardized the perception of fairness. Texas precedent, therefore, supports a careful review to uphold the judicial integrity required by law. 
4. Without evidence admitted in this matter, and without any findings on behalf of 
the tribunal,  the court chose to sever the parent- child relationship for one parent due to 
false claims made by another prior to being afforded an opportunity to present his case.

2 II. ARGUMENT  
This case exemplifies a serious violation of core due process principles, particularly 
in the failure of the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County as a whole  to substantiate its 
rulings with factual findings or evidentiary support. Such ungrounded decisions have 
resulted in substantial harm, indicating a concerning bias that jeopardizes a fair resolution. 
This bias has disrupted the parent -child relationship b y unjustly favoring one parent, 
despite indications that this party has prioritized personal interests over the children’s welfare, while penalizing the other without lawful basis. 
Without any factual or legal justification for these decisions, the only reasonable 
inference is an underlying bias, likely fueled by either fraudulent pleadings submitted by the Petitioner or an extrajudicial influence not in the record. These circumstances call for 
recusal to restore impartiality and procedural integrity. The judges’ actions contravene their duties under the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct, disregarding fundamental protections enshrined in both the U.S. Constitution and Texas law. Given these considerations, 
Respondent CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS respectfully requests that the Court grant the Joint Motion to Recuse and, in the interest of judicial economy, issue judgment without a hearing  if the opposing party does not respond by a designated date  deemed appropriate by 
the court. The Respondent further seeks pre -admission of uncontested evidence relevant to 
this motion to assist the Court’s determination.  
Given the questionable handling of the case, the original Joint Motion to Recuse has 
been concurrently attached as a separate lead document, fully hyperlinked for convenience .

3 III. Performing the Duties of Judicial Office Impartially and 
Diligently  
1. There are three prongs present within Canon 3 of the Texas Rules of Judicial 
Conduct. All three prongs, in general, “take precedence over all the judge's other 
activities ”, and each set forth standards to be followed in during the performance of such 
duties.1 The issue is whether District Judge James Munford and Associate Judge Jeffrey 
Kaitcer should be recused. The rules and analysis  of how they were applied in this case 
can only lead a reasonable fact finder to conclude that their recusal is warranted.  
A. PRONG 1 – ADJUDICATIVE DUTIES  
2. The first prong is the adjudicative standard outlined in Canon 3(B) of the Texas 
Code of Judicial Conduct. Paragraph 2 requires that “[a] judge should be faithful to the 
law and shall maintain professional competence in it,” and specifies that “[a] judge s hall 
not be swayed by partisan interests, public clamor, or fear of criticism.” Additionally, 
Paragraph 5 mandates that a judge “perform judicial duties without bias or prejudice,” 
while Paragraph 8 ensures that “[a] judge shall accord to every person who has a legal interest in a proceeding, or that person's lawyer, the right to be heard according to law.” 
Further, Paragraph 9 sets the standard that “[a] judge should dispose of all judicial 
matters promptly, efficiently and fairly.”  All of these paragraphs are directly relevant and 
can be applied in  the determination of recusal.  
 
1 Tex. Code Jud. Conduct Canon 3(A)

4 B. PRONG 2 – ADMINISTRATIVE  DUTIES 
 3. Standards for a judge’s administrative responsibilities are outlined under Canon 
3(C) of the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct. Paragraph 1 requires that “[a] judge should 
diligently and promptly discharge the judge's administrative responsibilities without b ias 
or prejudice, maintain professional competence in judicial administration, and cooperate 
with other judges and court officials in the administration of court business.” 
Additionally, paragraph 2 mandates that a judge must ensure that “staff, court offi cials, 
and others subject to the judge's direction and control observe the standards of fidelity 
and diligence that apply to the judge and refrain from manifesting bias or prejudice in the 
performance of their official duties.”  These standards are critical to the recusal motion 
because they underscore the judge's obligation not only to maintain impartiality in 
personal actions but also to actively prevent bias or prejudice in all court operations under their oversight.  
C. PRONG 3 – DISCIPLINARY  DUTIES  
4. Canon 3(D) of the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct outlines a judge's 
disciplinary responsibilities, which directly relate to maintaining the ethical integrity of the judicial process. Paragraph 1 requires that if a judge has clear information that 
another judge has violated the Code, they must take appropriate action. When the violation raises substantial concerns about the other judge's fitness for office, the judge is 
obligated to inform the State Commission on Judicial Conduct or take other suitable 
measures. Similarly, Paragraph 2 mandates that a judge who learns of a lawyer’s serious

5 breach of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct —especially one that 
questions the lawyer’s honesty, trustworthiness, or overall fitness —must report the 
violation to the Office of the General Counsel of the State Bar of Texas or take other 
appropriate action. These disciplinary obligations are highly relevant to the recusal 
motion. The standards reinforce a judge’s duty to uphold ethical conduct across all roles in the judicial system, ensuring that neither judicial nor legal misconduct goes 
unaddressed. In cases where bias, impropriety, or ethical breaches by a presiding judge 
are evident, the principles in Canon 3(D) underscore the necessity of recusal to protect 
the integrity of the proceedings and maintain the judiciary's credibility in the  eyes of the 
public. 
5. Notwithstanding the reasons set forth in the joint motion to recuse, the 
additional facts explained below show an intentional effort to deprive the Respondent access to justice after he has exhausted all other State remedies , and one needs to look no 
further than how the joint recusal motion was handled to highlight this effort  showcasing 
the appearance of impartiality, which warrants recusal.  
D. THE TEXAS RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE  
6.   Pursuant to the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 18(a)( f), the Respondent judges 
have two options  once a motion to recuse is filed. 1) the judge  can file with the clerk an 
order of recusal or disqualification, or 2) the judge  can sign and file with the clerk an 
order referring the motion to the regional presiding judge.

6 7. Rather than filing the orders of referral with the clerk of the court, they were
forwarded from the court coordinator via email, Lindsey Baker, with out the required 
certificate of service and remain inaccessible through the Texas Supreme Court approved 
electronic filing manager, re:Search Texas .  
8. The original motion was altered and did not contain the affidavit or exhibits
vital to the motion. This fact was promptly pointed out  in Exhibit 1 , where the file size 
difference can be seen from the email attachments. Click for reference. 
9.Lindsey Baker then confirmed that the exhibits and affidavits had been
forwarded. The file size difference was then pointed out  in the last correspondence  chain  
found within Exhibit 1 , to which an amended order of referral followed, and the reasons 
given for the modification of the original motion changed due to the motion’s length , 
thereby justifying the modification of the original motion into three parts. See Exhibit 2 . 
Click for reference.  
10.Given that the very purpose of re:Search Texas is to streamline the process of
service and case management, it raises the question as to why the court would choose to 
utilize the platform up until the joint motion to recuse was filed. Further, the Frequently 
Asked Questions found within the District Clerk’s website for electronic filing 
specifically reiterate that e xhibits should be merged into one document with the lead 
document , and that the file size limit is 35mb. Given that the Respondent’s original joint 
motion to recuse was well under the maximum size of 35mb, and the joint motion was filed as one document as the clerk prefers – why was it modified  and served outside of

7 the requirements of Rule 21a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure ? These facts were 
highlighted in the Respondent’s formal objection filed and served on all parties through 
the EFM on October 10, 2024, and is attached hereto as Exhibit 3 , and  remains 
undocketed  at the time of filing this motion . Click for reference.  
11. Finally, contradicting everything above, Judge Jeff Kaitcer’s order of referral 
was properly served through the EFM as one document, with the affidavit and all exhibits 
attached as one motio n, but is albeit missing from the electronic case docket. 
12. All undocketed filings that have been accepted by the court  but remain missing 
from the re:Search Texas platform or  that have been served to the respondent  and are 
missing from the re:Search Texas platform have been  attached hereto as Exhibit 4.  Click 
for reference. 
E. APPLICATION OF CANON 3 AND REMEDIAL ACTION  
13. The actions of Judges Munford and Judge Kaitcer demonstrate a clear 
de
parture from the standards of impartiality and integrity mandated by Canon 3 of the 
Texas Code of Judicial Conduct . The facts before this court reveal a pattern of procedural 
inconsistencies and biased decision -making that stem, in large part, from the Petitioner’s 
misleading tactics —an influence that these judges have inadvertently allowed to impact 
their rulings. Even though such information may have been obtained during the 
proceed ings, that information was kept private and never disclosed or entered into the 
record, leaving an appearance of impartiality, which is enough to warrant recusal. See 
Rogers v. Bradley , 909 S.W.2d 872, 873 (Tex.1995) (“Declaration of Recusal” by

8 Gammage, J.) (noting that issue is one of perception). “[B]eyond the demand that a judge 
be impartial is the requirement that judge appear to be impartial so that no doubts or 
suspicions exist as to the fairness or integrity of the court.”; see also Sears v. Olivarez , 28 
S.W.3d 611, 613– 14 (Tex.App. -Corpus Christi 2000, no pet.). The facts outlined above 
raise serious doubts to these requirements. 
14. Under C anon 3(B) , j udges are required to adjudicate based on impartiality and 
factual accuracy. However, the judges’ failure to critically assess the Petitioner’s narrative 
of hardship, coupled with improper handling of filings, has resulted in decisions that lack 
factual support and undermine the Respondent's rights to a fair hearing. This court now 
has the opportunity to address this lapse by recusing the judges and ensuring the case is 
overseen with genuine impartiality. 
15. Canon 3(C)  underscores the judges' responsibility to administer the court’s 
operations consistently and transparently. The irregular handling of critical filings —
orders forwarded without proper certificates of service, mismanagement within the EFM system, and discrepancies in access —demonstrate a failure in maintaining the procedural 
integrity essential to a fair process. These administrative oversights have obstructed the 
Respondent’s access to justice, and this court now has both the facts and the authority to 
remedy this. 
16. Finally, Canon 3(D)  obligates this court to take appropriate action if it is 
established that a violation has occurred within the code. The Respondent believes  that 
the violation is merely a  product of relying on fraudulent pleadings  by the Petitioner

9 mixed  with permitting a  likely unauthorized attorney to prosecute the case and  does not 
reflect on either Judge Munford or Judge Kaitcer’s overall fitness for office.  
F. A CLOSER LOOK AT CANON 3(D)(2)  
17. A judge who receives information clearly establishing that a lawyer has 
committed a violation of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct should 
take appropriate action. 
18. To assist in this determination, notwithstanding the current challenge to Ms. 
Carter’s authority, one needs to look no further than the current temporary orders in 
place , which is attached as Exhibit I in the original joint motion to recuse filed  on 
October 7, 2024 . 
19. On page 1, the orders read: “ On February 1, 2024, the Court heard Petitioner's 
motion for temporary orders.” A review of the record will show that no motion for 
temporary orders has been served to the Respondent in this matter, no notice of hearing 
was served to the parties regarding such a motion, and no hearing ever occurred 
regarding this motion.  
20. The orders move on to state that both parties “appeared by counsel and 
announced ready”  and “signed an agreed associate judge’s report”  when in fact, both 
parties appeared, but were rushed into a settlement agreement by the Respondent’s prior counsel due to his unwillingness to remain in the courthouse all day, leading to his 
termination. Steve Myers, a witness, was present in the conference room during this 
exchange. Neither party went before the judge on February 1
st, 2024. See Exhibit  6.

10 21. The agreement, which can be found in Exhibit E in the original joint motion to
recuse, had the following provisions at the bottom of page 5 of the agreement:  
“A typed written Order conforming to this Report will follow within 20 days from 
the date this Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be prepared by Dan Bacalis. 
Each attorney should approve the Order. The parties do not need to approve the Order. The attorney reviewing the proposed Order shall have five (5) days to do so. There are  no 
ten (10) day letters. If an agreement is not reached, a Motion to Sign shall be filed and set within thirty (30) days from the signing of this Report.” 
22.Given that an agreement was clearly not reached, the orders were reduced to
writing well beyond the 20 day requirement, the orders were not prepared by Dan Bacalis, no motion to sign was filed, and the Respondent was not given 5 days to review 
the orders , it calls into question as to how they were permitted to be rendered despite 
lacking the Respondent’s signature  and despite being served to him immediately prior to 
a hearing scheduled to challenge their legal foundation.  
23. Notwithstanding the above, the mere fact that the orders state “[t]he parties
have agreed to the terms of this order as evidenced by the signatures below.” and no 
signature from the Respondent is present showcases a pre -determined outcome, and a 
one-sided favoritism that warrants recusal.  
24. Finally, and most concerning, is the fact that Judge Jeff Kaitcer affixed his
signature to this document which states that “[t]he Court, after examining the record and the agreement of the parties and hearing the evidence and argument of counsel, finds that

11 all necessary p rerequisites o f the l aw h ave been l egally  satisfied a nd that the Court h a s 
jurisdiction o f this c ase a nd of all t he parties. ” 
25. The foregoing  statement can’t possibly be true fo r two reasons. 1) No evidence 
has b
een admitted into this case,  and no argument from counsel was presented  – only 
objections without foundation. 2) The associate judge could not h ave possibly examined 
the
 record, because it is apparent that consent was not present at the time of rendition, and 
the
 directives he ordered  within the agreement were not followed.  
26. Expandi ng on point 2 above, t he associate j udge c ould not p os sibly have 
examined t he re cord because i n the original answer to t he protective o rder filed b y th e 
Respondent, he c laimed d uress a s an a ffirmative d efense alongside fra ud and illegalit y. 
See E xhibit 7 .  
27. There c a n b e no claim o f duress u nless t he fo llowing e lements a re  present: (1 ) 
a
 threat o r action t aken w ithout l egal j ustification; (2 ) t he threat o r action w a s o f such a 
character as to  destroy t he other party's fre e ag ency; (3 ) the t hreat o r action o vercame t he 
opposing p arty's fre e will, causing t hem t o do something t hey would n ot otherwise h ave 
done a nd w ere n ot legally b ound t o  do; (4) the re straint w as imminent; a nd (5 ) the 
opposing p arty h ad no p re sent m eans o f protection (McMahan v. Greenwood , 108 S. W.3d 
467,
 482 (Tex.App.- Houston [1 4 th Dist.] 2003, pet. denied)).

12 28. The Petitioner ’ s actions —including s eeking a n emergency e x parte o rder, 
initiating an eviction, filing for divorce, and pursuing an additional protective order—
occurred within an 8-d ay s pan, representing actions taken without legal justification.  
(Exhibits A & B in the original Joint Motion to Recuse, and Exhibit 8 herein. 
Click for 
reference.
29. These actions threatened the Respondent’s livelihood by removing him from  
the residence 
he needed to provide for his children, as well as from the home where his 
children had 
been raised with their father. This threat materialized on January 16, 2024, 
when the 
Respondent was ordered to vacate the residence without justification. (Exhibit 
C in the original Joint Motion to Recuse)
30. These a ctions forced the Respondent to  sign an agreement he would not have 
otherwise a
ccepted. This agreement allowed him to return  to the residence but involved 
conditions t
hat removed his children from their home an d was under no legal obligation 
to s
ettle given th e circumstances of the case and the b aseless nature of the claims made 
against h
im. 
31. If the Respondent d id not sign, he would have faced no a lternative other than  
continued  exclusion from his residence and further impairment of his ability to provide 
for his c
hildren. This threat was imminent. 
  
  32. The R espondent’s counsel advised him to sign the agreement instead of  
proceeding to a hearing, leaving h im without a viable means of protection at that time. 
33. All
 elements of duress were present when the Respondent signed the
agreement. Judge Kaitcer and Ms. Carter were aware that consent was not p resent when

13 the orders were rendered yet  were entered  regardless. This disregard for procedural 
fairness and apparent partiality underscores the need for recusal.  
34. Finally, Ms. Carter signed a pleading containing false statements, in violation 
of Rule 4.01(a) of the Texas Rules of Disciplinary Conduct. She claimed that the 
Respondent agreed to the orders, that they were based on a hearing that never occurred, 
and referenced a motion never served t o the Respondent.  This court should address these 
actions in accordance with Canon 3(D)(2) of the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct.  
G. FINAL THOUGHTS  
 35. According to Tex. R. Civ. P. 21(d)(a)(1), a "court proceeding" includes any 
appearance before the court, such as a hearing or trial. Per Tex. R. Civ. P. 21(a), every 
pleading, plea, motion, or application to the court for an order—whether presented as a motion, plea, or other request —must be filed with the court clerk in writing, state the 
grounds, and be noted on the docket unless presented during a hearing or trial. 
 36. Should this matter proceed to a hearing, the court must adhere to the Texas 
Rules of Civil Procedure, including docketing all missing items listed in Exhibit 4 and 
following the service requirements in Rule 21a when scheduling the hearing. Informal 
notices via email only obscure the opportunity for an appeal and fail to comply with Texas Civil Procedure. The court cannot continue to overlook its duty to correct these 
oversights, nor can it ignore state laws to uphold decisions lacking any legal justification.

14 37. It is deeply troubling that the Respondent, a self -represented litigant, must 
underscore basic procedural requirements to ensure adherence to standard rules, while the 
Petitioner’s attorney has repeatedly disregarded these processes by raising baseless 
objections in proceedings yet remaining silent in the record. This absence of 
accountability raises questions about the attorney’s commitment to ethical standards and procedural integrity, and it is perplexing that any reviewing judge could ignore the 
severit y of the issues documented in this brief. 
38. It remains unanswered how a citizen of this state can be removed from his 
home and stripped of custody of his children based solely on unproven accusations by the 
other parent, without the opportunity to defend himself. Our society—and especially our 
children —should not be subjected to this level of disregard by elected officials.  
39. When such actions come from a vindictive parent willing to falsify the ir 
financial status and weave a false narrative for protection, the court should take 
appropriate action to prevent such deceptive actions from occurring in the future, and 
should surely be a factor in determining their fitness as a parent. 
IV . CONCLUSION  
Recusing Judges Munford and Kaitcer is the first step  to restore the Respondent’s 
rights as all other state remedies have been exhausted. These are essential first steps this 
court can now take. These actions will not only uphold Canon 3(D)’s  standards but will 
also correct procedural injustices, ensuring that the case can proceed in alignment with

15 the highest principles of fairness and impartiality. Such principals in this instance 
demand that new judges be assigned to this case to examine the clear and intentional 
deception on which it was founded—deception initiated in bad faith during the week of 
Christmas by MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS.
T
he court’s decision to stop docketing pleadings at the time the recusal motion 
w
as filed along with its handling of the matter occurring outside of e stablished legal 
standards
 wou ld lead any reasonable member of the public to question whether the 
judges were acting impartially in this matter. 
Such impartiality has rewarded a mother that has fabricated not only her financial 
status
 to this court, but has also fabricated a  false need fo r protection to her own benefit. 
Such action should not be tolerated, and should bear a heavy consequence.
 
The ongoing denial of a parent's constitutionally protected rights to his children 
and residence, despite multiple opportunities to address the situation, reflects a 
concerning lack of adequate legal justification by the current judges.
Without a factual basis or explanation for the court’s decisions after ten months, 
they
 must be recused so  that the truth of the matter may be addressed. The court must not 
t
olerate the levels of deception and fraud committed  by the Petitioner, and the 
R
espondent reiterates that despite the egregious acts taken  against him in totality, he 
holds no ill will toward any p articipant in  this matter, and solely seeks a just and swift 
resolution for the sake of his children and to uphold the law to the best of his ability.

18 AFFIDAVIT OF CHARLES MYERS  
STAT
E OF TEXAS  
COUNTY OF TARRANT  
BEFORE ME, the undersigned authority, on this day personally appeared Charles Dustin 
Myers , who, after being duly sworn, did depose and state as follows:  
1.Introduction and BackgroundMy name is Charles Dustin Myers, and I am the Respondent in the case No. 322-744263 -23 & No. 322- 744538 -23, In the Matter of the Marriage of Morgan
Michelle Myers & Charles Dustin Myers and in the Interest of M.E.M. & C.R.M.,Minor Children, currently pending in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County,Texas. I am above 18 years of age, competent to make this affidavit, and have
personal knowledge of the facts stated herein, which are true and correct.
2.Procedural Violations and Due Process Concerns
Since the initiation of this case, I have encountered numerous proceduralirregularities that have obstructed my right to a fair hearing. I was removed from
my residence and separated from my children on January 16, 2024, based solely
on allegations made by the Petitioner, without any evidentiary findings or anopportunity to defend myself in a formal hearing. This deprivation of my rights
was executed without adherence to the foundational principles of due process.
3.Duress in Signing the February 1, 2024, Agreement
On February 1, 2024, I was compelled to sign an agreement that I did not fully

19 understand nor agree w ith. This a greement a llowed m e limited a ccess b ack i nto 
my re sidence b ut resulted i n the re m oval o f m y c hildren fro m their home. My 
decision to sign was made under duress, as I was ad vised by my attorney to accept 
these terms rather than proceed to a hearing . Due to the potential of further 
exclusion
 from my home and livelihood, I felt I had no other viable option to 
s
afeguard my a bility t o continue p ro viding f o r my c hildren. 
4.Bi
as and Lack of Impartiality
I have serious concerns regarding the impartiality of Judges Munford and Kaitcer,
as the procedural management of this case has shown a consistent disregard for
my rights. My filings and objections have been met with resistance and have often
been undocket ed or handled irregularly, while the Petitioner’s pleadings have
proceeded unchecked, despite containing misleading and unsubstantiated claims.This pattern of favoritism and procedural leniency towards the Petitioner has
compromised the integrity of these proceedings.
5.Misrepresentation and Lack of Consent in Orders
The current orders on record falsely state that both parties appeared before the
court on February 1, 2024, announced readiness, and signed an agreed associate
judge’s report. In reality, there was no formal hearing or review of evidence onthat date, and I did not give my consent to the terms as recorded. Furthermore, the
orders assert that necessary legal prerequisites were met, when, in fact, no such
procedural steps were observed. These inaccuracies directly impact my rights andthe fairness of these p roceedings.

20 6. Unethical Conduct and Professional Misconduct  
The Petitioner’s counsel, Ms. Carter, signed and submitted pleadings containing 
false statements, misrepresenting my consent to the orders and claiming that a 
hearing had occurred when it had not. This conduct violates Rule 4.01(a) of the Texas Rules of Disciplinary Conduct and Canon 3(D)(2) of the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct. Such behavior not only misleads the court but also deprives me 
of a fair and just resolution. 
7. Need for Recusal  
Given these procedural irregularities, false representations, and lack of impartiality demonstrated by Judges Munford and Kaitcer, I respectfully request their recusal 
from this case. Their actions and the management of this case have created an appearance  of partiality, depriving me of my right to due process and casting 
doubt on the integrity of these proceedings . 
8. Request for Judicial Review and Corrective Action  
I request that this court take immediate action to address the procedural oversights, docket missing filings as per Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and ensure an 
impartial review of the facts in this case. I seek a fair hearing, free from bias, 
where the truth can be assessed without obstruction. In the interest of justice, I also urge the court to examine the Petitioner’s documented misrepresentations and their 
impact on the well -being of my children, M.E.M. and C.R.M.

21 9. Conclusion 
This affidavit is submitted with sincere intent to restore fairness and procedural 
integrity to these proceedings, not out of malice or animosity toward any 
individual involved. My only goal is to reach a resolution that genuinely considers the best interests of my children and respects my constitutional rights as a parent. 
I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

THOMAS A. WILDER
DISTRICT CLERK

NO. 322 -744263 -23 
IN THE 322ND DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY , TEXAS  
OBJECTION AND REQUEST 
TO D
OCKET   
Respondent  respec t
fully objects to the handling of the case documents regarding 
the joint motion to recuse filed on October 7th, 2024  for the foregoing reasons:  
I.FAILURE TO DOCKET
1. Respo ndent’ s motion to recuse has not been docketed on the research Texas
platform. Metadata from the efile Texas platform shows the last docketed pleading to be 
the Respondent ’s Proposed Order on Rule 12  Motion  (id # 
7f9852d3f4205e0083d02b0536696131 ) See attache d Exhibit A. 
2. The correspondence to Regional Judge David Evans from  District Judge  James
Munford has not been docketed . 
3. The amended order of referral signed on October 9th, 2024 , by District Judge
James Munford  has not been docketed . IN THE MATTER  
OF THE MARRIAGE OF  
MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS  
AND CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS  
AND IN THE INTEREST OF M  
M  AND C  M , 
CHILDREN

4 . The correspondence  and order of referral  to Regional Judge David Evans from 
Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer signed October 10th, 2024, has not been docketed. 
II. RELEV ANT COURT RULES  
5. According to Rule 25  and Rule 26  of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, the 
clerk is required to maintain a file docket and a court docket that record all filings, 
motions, orders, and proceedings in a case. The failure to properly docket these 
documents violates these rules and further compromises the integrity of the case record. 
III. INCONSISTENT RESPONSES AND FAILURE TO FOLLOW PROTOCOL 
6. The Respondent was initially informed via email that the exhibits and affidavits  
had been filed. However, after the Respondent pointed out discrepancies in file size, the 
explanation changed to the document being too large. This inconsistency raises concerns 
about transparency and procedural fairness.  Exhibit B  
7. As outlined in the Tarrant County FAQ , Respondent's original submission of 20 
MB was well within the 36 MB limit, and the Respondent followed all proper e -filing 
procedures. Despite this, the filing was forwarded to the regional judge without the 
exhibits and affidavits and later split into three sections due to the supposed size limit —
yet the documents were never subsequently docketed.  
IV . THE ONLY RECEIPT CONTAINS THE INCORRECT PLEADNIGS

8. Despite the emails sent to the Respondent from the court coordinator Lindsey 
Baker, there is no official receipt that the correct motion, as filed, was delivered to the 
regional judge  from either respondent.  
 9. The motion as originally filed was mo dified for reasons that  did not remain 
persistent. The reasoning given related to file size contradicts the FAQ from the Tarrant 
County District Clerk. If a separate system is used to forward these files to the Re gional 
Judge, the Respondent respectfully requests that this be clarified given the severity of the 
situation.  
CONCLU SION  AND  REQUEST 
Given the persistent inconsistencies, failure to properly docket the Respondent's 
filings, and the lack of transparency surrounding the handling of crucial case documents, 
Respondent Charles Dustin Myers  formally objects to the actions of the 322nd District 
Court and requests immediate correction of the docketing failures. Furthermore, 
Respondent requests validation that the correct motions and accompanying exhibits were 
forwarded to the regional judge  as originally filed . The files officially served to the 
Respondent via eFile do not contain the original joint motion . In light of these ongoing 
procedural issues, Respondent reserves the right to seek further remedies unless proper procedural requirements are followed to ensure equal protection under the United States 
Constitution.

EXHIBIT 5
Respondent's unopposed First Amended Motion for 
Temporary Orders - filed 09/27/24.

NO. 322- 744263- 23 
IN THE 322ND DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS  
FOREWORD  
On January 16th, 2024, amid inclement weather, the Respondent was 
ordered to vacate the residency at a show cause hearing for an order of protection 
where a continuance was granted, and cause number 322-744263-2 3 was 
consolidated with cause number 322-744538- 23 on the court’s own motion, and 
the case was reset to January 22nd, 2024, and then again for February 1st, 2024, 
where a settlement agreement was quickly drafted and Respondent was advised to sign it by his former counsel.  
This led to the subsequent termination of counsel, leaving Respondent to 
request an emergency hearing to vacate the associate judge’s report for temporary orders, which was the only hearing to date in this case after eight months.  
The unusual circumstances surrounding the initiation of this case warrant 
the court's reconsideration of the Respondent's original answer and subsequent briefs
1 filed before the initial setting. Given the evolving facts and the clear 
foresight demonstrated in these earlier submissions, Respondent respectfully urges the court to revisit these filings in the interest of ensuring a just resolution.   IN THE MATTER OF THE

6 4. Extraordinary relief
E. Given the extraordinary circumstances of this case, Respondent,
CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, requests that the court order his return to the 
residency , where he will resume rent payments and begin transitioning and recovering from the ongoing deprivation that has lasted throughout the 
case. The Respondent has attached a proposed parenting plan which was 
overlooked on January 16
th, 2024, when this court decided to order him to 
vacate the residency which he requires to financially support the Children 
during the pendency of the case.  
F . Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS further requests that the
court vacate the orders currently in place sua sponte replacing them with 
the current orders, which will allow him to withdraw his Motion for Rehearing in the Supreme Court of Texas. Cause no. 24 -0395.  
G. The Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS prays the Court will
take swift action and intends to demonstrate through his actions how these orders suit the best interests of the children in this case.  
H. The Respondent respectfully requests expedited action on this
motion by October 1
st, 2024, as he will be forced to temporarily relocate to 
Denton, Texas pending relief, which will further exacerbate the situation and will further separate him from his children.

7 CONCLUSION 
i. The Petitioner appeared before this 
Court on December 14, 2023,
requesting an ex-p arte temporary order of protection, and subsequently filed a 
protective order on December 22, 2023. The Respondent contends that the 
Petitioner's narrative is
 an attempt to avoid accountability for her extramarital 
affairs which was discovered
 just prior to the initiation of her pleadings. 
ii.While the Petitioner engaged in activities outside the marriage, the
Respondent remained at home caring for the children. During the time the 
Petitioner pursued legal actions shortly before Christmas, the Respondent was 
preparing for the children's holiday. Since taking residence in the family home, 
the Petitioner has 
reportedly moved in her sister, reduced her employment to 
three hours per da
y, failed to complete the court-o rdered parenting course, and is 
not contributing rent to her grandmother. The Respondent asserts that there is 
sufficient evidence on record to substantiate these claims, and predicted this exact 
outcome within his 
first pleadings within the clerk’s record, attached hereto. 
iii.The Respondent believes that this case has been conducted in the best
interest of the Petitioner rather than the children, a concern that has been 
repeatedly raised without response.
 The current orders in place are lack lawful 
foundation, and there has b
een minimal meaningful engagement from the 
Petitioner's attorney. The Respondent is concerned about the ongoing financial

8 erosion a ffecting t he children's w ell-being a nd sees n o logical basis t o consider t he 
existing arrangements as serving their best interests. 
iv.Granting this motion 
would initiate a long-o verdue healing process. The
Petitioner s hould be r equired t o explain h er actions a nd be h eld a ccountable. T he 
Respondent e mphasizes t he cr itical n eed f or access t o the r esidence t o provide f or 
the children w hile seeking a lternative accommodations n earby. This n eed i s 
argued to t ake precedence over t he Petitioner's d esire to p rotect h erself f rom the 
consequences of her own actions. 
v.The Respondent respectfully urges the Court to intervene and m ake a
decision that genuinely serves the best interests of the children. 
vi.If anything else – the orders currently in place show the truth. Mother
can’t pay rent, h
asn’t completed her responsibilities for the Children, and has 
reduced h er employment. Father has followed all aspects of the orders that he is 
able to given the circumstances.  
vii.So long as the Children are in Father’s care and he is given a fair
amount of time to transition from the residency to ensure that he may still provide 
for his Children financially while the case is pending, the status quo will be 
maintained. 
viii. Father has overwhelming evidence to support all claims herein, already
served to Petitioner, and without response, and already on the record. 
Respondent prays that this Court will consider the totality of the case, and grant 
this motion to rightfully restore the status quo.

9 PRAYER FOR EXPEDITED RELIEF  
Respondent  requests the following expedited relief:  
1. Vacate the current orders, which were entered in violation of
the Respondent's right to due process and a fair hearing. These 
orders were rendered as "agreed" without the Respondent's 
consent and are unsupported by any motion that was properly served on him. 
2. Grant the Respondent's motion for temporary orders without
notice or hearing to the Petitioner, restoring the status quo for the children and enabling the Respondent to meet his financial obligations  related to the Children  and allow healing to begin.  
3. Provide a provision allowing the Respondent to return to the
residence at where he was 
wrongfully removed  including the option for Petitioner to reside 
there as well if she so chooses.  
4.Strike all pleadings from the Respondent other than the Rule 12motion to show authority and the summary judgement motion in
the interest of judicial economy .
5. Grant any further relief that this Court finds equitable, just,
and appropriate  so that we may finally get this case headed 
in the right direction and in alignment with the Children’s 
best interest.
