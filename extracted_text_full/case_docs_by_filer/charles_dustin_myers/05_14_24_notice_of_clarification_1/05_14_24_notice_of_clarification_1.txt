Copy from re:SearchTX

The Petitioner respectfully submits this notice to the Clerk of the Court, Debra 
Spisak, in response to the case notice provided in respect to the above numbered cause, 
electronically served at approximately 6:06 P. M.  
This notice is submitted in good faith, and is brought before this Honorable Court 
in the interest of judicial efficiency for the following reasons:  
1. Two Judges Presiding – three temporary orders issued . 
a. On January 16th, 2024, the Petitioner was ordered to show cause for a  
protective order filed by Morgan Michelle Myers, which was served to him 
on January 27th, 2024.  
Copy from re:SearchTX

b. Due to the inclement weather,  it was learned upon arrival that District 
Judge, Hon. James Munford,  was the only available judge in the courtroom 
at the time.  
c. Judge Munford presided over the initial show cause hearing, where he 
consolidated the case with the concurrent divorce suit filed by Morgan 
Michelle Myers, Respondent herein,  on December 18th, 2023 , granted a 
continuance, and ruled on all major issues temporarily. A certified copy of 
the initial rendition issued 01.16.2024 is attached to this notice.  
d. On January 22nd, Jeffrey Kaitcer presided over the case  and would remain 
the presiding judge for the remainder of the proceedings. The Petitioner 
was represented by Dan Bacalis, and the Respondent retained Cooper L. 
Carter minutes before the scheduled hearing, which caused further delay 
until February 1st, 2024, and which temporary orders were issued by Judge 
Kaitcer. A certified copy of this  order has been attached to this notice.  
e. On February 1st, 2024, the legal representatives entered into a settlement 
agreement, which was later withdrawn and challenged on reconsideration 
before Hon. Jeffrey Kaitcer on March 14th, 2024,  which was denied.  A 
certified copy of the agreement has been attached to this notice along with 
the denial of the Petitioner ’s motion to vacate.  
2. The relief being sought aims to vacate temporary orders issued by Jeffrey 
N. Kaitcer.

f. On March 26th, 2024, the Agreed Associate Judge’ s report was reduced to 
writing and filed with the court, becoming the temporary orders the 
Petitioner seeks to vacate that remains in effect until the final decree of 
divorce is signed. A certified copy of this order has been attached to this 
notice.  
3. Issues in the Second Court of Appeals 
g. On April 8th, 2024, a notice was filed with the Second Court of Appeals 
regarding the Petitioner ’s writ of mandamus,  which was addressed to both 
Honorable judges mentioned herein, however, for the purposes of the appellate record, was only addressed to Hon. James Munford, a copy of 
which has been attached to this notice.  
h. The Petitioner ’s subsequent motions for rehearing and rehearing en banc 
pointed out this clerical issue,  but it remains on the record.  
 
4. Issues in the Supreme Court 
i. The Petitioner filed a petition for review yesterday , May 13
th, 2024, 
captioned identically to this notice. However, upon receipt of the notice, the 
same issues remain, which the Petitioner seeks to have rectified for judicial 
efficiency given the seriousness of the case, and ensure that the Court is 
able to perform a proper review of the case void of these errors.  
Additionally, the notice incorrectly designates the petition for review as a writ of mandamus, where the standard of review differs.

5. Conclusion 
j. The Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court take judicial notice of the 
following: 
i. Two judges presided over the case, Hon. James Munford and Hon. Jeffrey Kaitcer from the 322
nd District Court of Tarrant 
County.  
ii. The Petitioner seeks de novo review of his case from the 
Supreme Court on petition for review . 
iii. The Petitioner understands that the court has the discretion to re-classify the brief as a mandamus if the issues raised and 
relief sought align more closely to the Court’ s jurisdiction, or 
for judicial efficiency . 
iv. The Petitioner files this notice to ensure the court is fully 
aware of the involvement of two Judges, thereby aiding in a fair and efficient judicial review .
