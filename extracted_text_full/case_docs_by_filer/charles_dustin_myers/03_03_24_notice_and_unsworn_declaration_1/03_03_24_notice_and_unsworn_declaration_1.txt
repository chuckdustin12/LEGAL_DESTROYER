Petitioner,   
  
v.  
 NOTICE AND UNSWORN DECLARATION  
  
Charles Dustin Myers,   
  
Respondent   
  
March 3, 2024   
 
Dear Clerk of the Court,  
This letter is submitted on behalf of the Respondent in the above -referenced case to 
provide the court with an update on the Respondent's efforts to uphold the well -being of 
the children under the current agreed arrangements pending review and to navigate the 
complexities of this case . The following reasons  why i t is impo ssible for the Respondent 
to vacate the family home under the current agreement pending review  are a s follows : 
1. Since the inception of the case, the Respondent's primary focus has been to reset 
the status quo ante for the benefit of the children, ensuring their lives remain as 
normal and uninterrupted as possible during this transitory period  after it was 
significantly disrupted beginning on January 16th, 2024 . Despite the challenges 
posed by the non -suited protective order and the dropped allegations of family 
violence  which were the foundations of all decisions made within this case , the 
Respondent has  respected the orders pending review, and has  strived to provide a 
stable and supportive environment for his children during his designated time , all 
while planning a transition that best suits his children.  
 
2. During the short amount of time the Respondent has been re -instated to his home, 
the Petitioner has, on multiple occasions, entered the residence unannounced and 
without prior consent, actions which stand in stark contrast to her prior requests 
for protection  which have governed this case .
