The following reasons  why i t is impo ssible for the Respondent \nto vacate the family home under the current agreement pending review  are a s follows : \n1. Since the inception of the case, the Respondent's primary focus has been to reset \nthe status quo ante for the benefit of the children, ensuring their lives remain as \nnormal and uninterrupted as possible during this transitory period  after it was \nsignificantly disrupted beginning on January 16th, 2024 . Despite the challenges \nposed by the non -suited protective order and the dropped allegations of family \nviolence  which were the foundations of all decisions made within this case , the \nRespondent has  respected the orders pending review, and has  strived to provide a \nstable and supportive environment for his children during his designated time , all \nwhile planning a transition that best suits his children.  \n \n2. During the short amount of time the Respondent has been re -instated to his home, \nthe Petitioner has, on multiple occasions, entered the residence unannounced and \nwithout prior consent, actions which stand in stark contrast to her prior requests \nfor protection  which have governed this case . \n 322-744263-23 FILED\nTARRANT COUNTY\n3/4/2024 12:00 AM\nTHOMAS A.
