 NO. 233- 765358- 25 
 
IN THE 233RD DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY , TEXAS  
 
 
TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT:  
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
 
There comes a time in the journey of life when a man finds himself standing 
in the same muddy footprints he left as a child, gazing up at the same towering 
courthouse steps, and feeling that same sinking sensation in his chest. It’s a peculiar 
thing, this cycle of disappointment —to have lived it once as a bewildered child and 
then again as a rule- abiding adult. The faces change, the dates on the calendar 
adva nce, but the feeling remains as familiar as an old, worn book. 
Petitioner comes before this Court not with anger burning in his chest, nor 
with vindictiveness poisoning his pen, but rather with that quiet, heavy disappointment that settles in a person’s bones when they’ve done everything by

 the book only to find the book itself has been shelved away, forgotten by those 
sworn to read from it.  
Petitioner followed the rules. He honored the procedures. He placed his faith 
in a system that promised justice would flow like water, clear and unobstructed, to those who seek it properly. He lived under the façade of facially void orders, and sustained e xtraordinary damages that were all caused intentionally by one person: 
the Respondent , who has sat in complete silence as this breakdown has continued 
to occur.  
Yet here stands Petitioner, a father twice removed —once from his home 
and once from his children—knocking on the courthouse door with papers properly filed, only to be told that the door shall remain closed because someone else might, at some future date, file papers at another door entirely. If this strikes the Court as a curious interpretation of justice, then we find ourselves in rare agreement.  
Mark Twain once observed that “the difference between the almost right word and the right word is really a large matter —it’s the difference between the lightning bug 
and the lightning.” In matters of law and children’s welfare, the difference between almos t justice and actual justice is equally vast—it’s the difference between 
children thriving and children suffering, between a father’s presence and his absence, between following the law and merely gesturing toward it.  
The Petitioner is now in an extraordinary circumstance. On one hand, he 
must seek mandamus relief respectfully compelling this Court to fulfill its

3 
 ministerial duty to hear and rule on Petitioner’s properly file d emergency TRO , 
which this Court refused to hear on March 28, 2025. The refusal came not from any 
defect in the filing itself, but solely from representations made by opposing counsel 
regarding a future filing in another  court which she abandoned—a procedural 
sleight of hand that has left children in distress and a father without an adequate 
remedy for an appeal.  
On the other hand, the Petitioner must prohibit the 322nd District Court from 
setting a matter for a hearing that cannot bear a valid result through a concurrent 
Writ of Prohibition. The proper procedure wasn’t followed, and cannot be 
overlooked in the face of an emergency.  
 In essence, a procedurally improper forward- looking consolidation motion 
to be filed in a different court was used to block a properly filed emergency TRO 
before this court. The court cannot rule on a case not before it, and mandamus is 
the proper remedy here if this court refuses to act. Given the extraordinary circumstances of this matter, and given there has been no response or opposition to 
the relief being requested, the court should grant the emergency TRO 
immediately through a written order delivered to all the parties via the 
electronic filing manager, set the matter for a hearing 14 days from the signing of 
the order, and require a written response from the opposing party no later than 7 
days prior to the hearing.

4 
  Despite the circumstances of this case, Petitioner feels that settlement will 
and could be a possibility in the future, but the priority remains to rebuild the status 
quo of the children that has been destroyed and regain the ability to provide for his children financially while damages are assessed and attended to. Petitioner is at the  very least entitled to this immediate relief .  He is not asking this court for anything 
more than what it has the discretion to do and what the law demands  that it must do  
given the circumstances . This intent to file mandamus is filed out of respect and 
serves as a notice to all parties of record of my position on this matter.  
Such absurdity should end with an order from this court in Petitioner’s 
favor, and in support thereof, he shows the following unopposed facts:  
II. STATEMENT OF FACTS  
1. On January 24, 2025, after more than 11 months of inaction, Petitioner  
filed a Motion to  Dismiss for Want of Prosecution. The divorce case no 
substantive action from Respondent  since April 2024, a legal ghost ship drifting 
without direction or purpose. That motion wasn’t attempted to be set for hearing until September of 2024, only after the Petitioner exhausted all efforts seeking relief throughout the Texas Judiciary without any participation from the opposing side. 
2. On March 19, 2025, driven by mounting concerns about the  children’s 
welfare and learning that the 322
nd District Court did not have continuous, 
exclusive jurisdiction over the children in this matter , Petitioner  filed a new

5 
 SAPCR in this Court (Cause No. 233- 765358- 25) seeking emergency  relief for 
the children. The very next day, March 20, 2025, Ms. Carter suddenly reappeared 
like a character presumed missing  in the second act, filing an answer  to the 
SAPCR petition in this Court and thereby submitting to this Court’s  jurisdiction 
by filing a response rather than a motion to abate.  
3. On March 21, 2025, Petitioner  filed a verified Rule 12 motion 
challenging Ms. Carter’s  authority to represent Respondent in this matter —the 
second such challenge,  met with the same resounding silence as the first.  
4. On March 25, 2025, Petitioner  filed an Objection to Consolidation and 
an Ex -Parte Emergency Motion for TRO. Two days later, on March 27, 2025, 
Petitioner contacted the court coordinator, requested a date and time to present the 
motion, and served the documents to the opposing party with the intent to present on March 28, 2025, at 9:00 A.M. before the Associate Judge of this Court.  On that 
fateful morning of March 28, 2025, Petitioner  drove to the courthouse, paid for  
parking, met with the coordinator, communicated with opposing counsel, and secured a hearing date of April 10, 2025. Petitioner  then proceeded to the 
Associate Judge’s courtroom to present the TRO.  
5. Before Petitioner  could present his  case—before he  could speak a single 
word about  his children’s welfare—he  was told that Ms. Carter would be filing a 
motion to  consolidate in the 322nd District Court, that his  motion was improperly 
before  the court, and that the Associate Judge refused to hear the motion. It was a

6 
 curious thing, this refusal. Ms. Carter wasn’t even present in the  courtroom, yet 
her words carried more weight than Petitioner’s physical presence,  his properly 
filed papers, and most importantly, the urgent needs of his  children. She stopped 
the proceedings  with nothing more than word of mouth for the incorrect motion. 
A true showcasing of disregard for the process, and the children.  
6. On April 2, 2025, Petitioner  filed a Pre -Objection to Motion to 
Consolidate in the 322nd District Court. Ms. Carter’s motion to consolidate wasn’t 
filed with the 322nd District Court until April 3, 2025 —six days after she used its 
mere possibility to  prevent this Court from hearing Petitioner’s  emergency 
motion. Her motion disregarded  Petitioner’s  pre-objection entirely, as if it were 
invisible ink on the page. 
7. On April 4, 2025, unable to acquire a ruling due to Petitioner’s 
objection, Ms. Carter  attempted to set the motion for a hearing before the 322nd 
District Court. That same day, Petitioner  filed a Pre- Objection to Motion to 
Transfer in this Court, given that  a motion to transfer must come before any 
attempt at consolidation.  Ms. Carter, who had been so urgently concerned about 
consolidation when it  served to block Petitioner’s  emergency hearing, suddenly 
claimed to be unavailable until late April—causing significant delays that could 
have been avoided had this  Court simply heard the motion before it on March 28, 
2025.

7 
 8. Throughout this period of procedural maneuvering, the  children have 
been  subjected to psychological manipulation and medical neglect. They have 
been  removed from Petitioner’s  care and placed with elderly great -grandparents  
on a daily basis , and are being gaslighted into a false belief that the  divorce is 
finalized. Petitioner’s  eldest child’s academic performance has plummeted,  and 
both children have become emotionally estranged from both parents. Petitioner  
has suffered approximately $110,500 in verifiable financial damages due to being 
locked out of his  home  and business, and it grows each day. But the  financial toll 
pales in comparison to the emotional cost of watching Petitioner’s  children  suffer 
while the courts exchange procedural ly incorrect  volleys over his head.  
III. ARGUMENT  
A. The Court's Ministerial Duty  
9. It is well- established Texas law that a trial court has a ministerial 
duty—not a discretionary duty—to consider and rule upon motions properly filed 
and pending before it. In re Sheppard, 193 S.W.3d 181, 183 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2006, orig. pr oceeding); In re Chavez, 62 S.W.3d 225, 228 (Tex. 
App.—Amarillo 2001, orig. proceeding). The Texas Supreme Court has consistently held that while a court has discretion in how it rules on a motion, it has no discretion to refuse to rule at all. In re Blake ney, 254 S.W.3d 659, 661 
(Tex. App.—Texarkana 2008, orig. proceeding) ("When a motion is properly filed and pending before a trial court, the act of considering and ruling upon that

8 
 motion is a ministerial act, and mandamus may issue to compel the trial judge to 
act.").  
10. This principle is not merely a procedural nicety but a fundamental 
cornerstone of our judicial system. When a court refuses to hear a properly filed motion, it effectively denies access to justice itself. As the Texas courts have repeatedly emphasized,  "A trial court's refusal to rule on a pending motion within 
a reasonable amount of time constitutes a clear abuse of discretion." In re Bonds, 
57 S.W.3d 456, 457 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2001, orig. proceeding). This abuse is magnified exponentially when the motion concerns the welfare of children and seeks emergency relief.  
11. The Court's refusal to hear Petitioner's properly filed emergency TRO 
on March 28, 2025, constitutes a clear failure to perform a ministerial duty. This failure is particularly concerning  given that:  
a) The motion was properly filed and noticed for hearing and the parties agreed on a date and time set for April 10
th, 2025;  
b) Petitioner communicated with court staff, physically appeared at the courthouse ready to present the motion and was told he could present his motion ; 
    c) The motion concerned the immediate welfare of children; and  
    d) The refusal was based solely on representations about a future filing in another court that had not yet occurred.

9 
 B. Clear Abuse of Discretion  
12. A writ of mandamus is appropriate when a trial court clearly abuses its 
discretion  and there is no adequate remedy by appeal . In re Prudential Ins. Co. of 
Am., 148 S.W.3d 124, 135- 36 (Tex. 2004); Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 
840 (Tex. 1992) . An abuse if discretion is clearly established from point one 
below, and supported by points two through eight:  
i. First, it refused to perform its ministerial duty to hear and 
rule on a properly filed motion based solely on representations 
about a future filing in another court. It’s as if a doctor refused to 
treat a bleeding patient because another doctor  might, at some 
future date, claim the patient should be treated at a different  
hospital. 
ii. Second, it failed to recognize that by answering the 
SAPCR petition in  this Court, Respondent submitted to this 
Court’s jurisdiction and should have instead filed a motion to abate 
or should have moved to transfer the case. The law doesn’t allow 
for half- measures of jurisdiction. 
iii. Third, it failed to recognize that this Court maintained 
jurisdiction until any  transfer was completed pursuant to Texas 
Family Code § 155.005( d) as no final order has been rendered in 
the 322nd District Court. Jurisdiction  isn’t a hot potato to be

10 
 dropped at the first mention of another court —it’s a  solemn 
responsibility that remains until properly transferred.  
iv. Fourth, it failed to recognize that the proper procedure 
for consolidation of cases  in different courts requires a motion to 
transfer to be filed and granted before any motion to consolidate 
can be considered, pursuant to Texas Family Code §§ 155.201 and 
6.407. The law provides a sequence, a proper order of operations, 
that cannot be reversed or circumvented without creating 
procedural delay, which is what the emergency TRO sought to 
prevent from occurring. 
v. Fifth, it allowed opposing counsel to circumvent proper 
legal procedure by  influencing this Court’s decision without being 
present and without having filed any response to the emergency 
TRO  properly before  this Court. It’s as if the referee in a football 
game made a call  based on what someone in the parking lot said 
might happen in the fourth quarter  when she had the rules of the 
game mixed up.  
vi. Sixth, it failed to consider that the purported “agreed” 
orders in the divorce case  are void for lack of consent under 
Burnaman v. Heaton, 240 S.W.2d 288, 291 (Tex. 1951). A void 
order is no order at all —it’s a legal nullity, as insubstantial as a

11 
 shadow on the wall. No court has continuous, exclusive 
jurisdiction over the children in this matter.  
vii. Seventh, it failed to recognize that the Associate 
Judge’s orders in the divorce  case were never properly adopted by 
the referring District Court as required  by Texas Family Code § 
201.013(b). An unadopted order is like an unsigned check —it may 
look official, but it carries no legal weight , yet it has been used to 
bar the Petitioner from his residence, business, and children, and 
impose a disruptive and chaotic schedule upon the children.  
viii. Eighth, and perhaps most troublingly, it disregarded 
the children’s best interests  in favor of procedural considerations, 
contrary to Texas Family Code § 153.002 and has languished for 
over a year due to the opposition’s failure to prosecute . 
 
12. The law is clear that in matters involving children, their welfare must 
be the  court’s primary consideration—not procedural niceties, not docket 
management,  and certainly not the convenience of opposing counsel. 
C. No Adequate Remedy by Appeal  
13. When Justice Delayed Is Justice Denied  Petitioner has no adequate 
remedy by appeal for reasons that should stir the  conscience of any court:  The 
emergency nature of the injunctive relief sought requires immediate action, as

12 
 Petitioner’s children are suffering immediate and ongoing harm while procedural 
issues remain unresolved . In re Texas Dep’t of Family & Protective Servs. , 255 
S.W.3d 613, 615 (Tex. 2008) (granting emergency relief where children’s welfare was at immediate risk).  Petitioner’s children are being alienated from him,  
causing long-term psychological damage that cannot be undone by a favorable ruling months or years in the future. In re Scheller , 325 S.W.3d 640, 643 (Tex. 
2010) (recognizing that interference with the parent -child relationship can 
constitute irreparable harm).  
14. The improper procedural maneuvers by opposing counsel are causing 
significant delays that cannot be remedied through the normal appellate process. Each  day that passes is another day the children suffer, another day their academic  
performance declines, another day they become more emotionally estranged  in a 
situation that the law should’ve prevented from existing to begin with. 
15. Temporary orders in family law cases are generally not appealable, 
leaving  Petitioner in a procedural trap with no exit. Waiting for a final judgment 
to appeal would allow the improper procedural tactics to succeed, causing irreparable harm to Petitioner and his children. 
16. Void orders are being enforced against Petitioner, causing ongoing 
harm that cannot be adequately remedied by appeal. In re Sw. Bell Tel. Co., 35 
S.W.3d 602, 605 (Tex. 2000). Petitioner is caught in a procedural echo 
chamber

13 
 with no effective remedy, as both courts  have effectively denied him access to the 
judicial system. In re Team Rocket,  L.P. , 256 S.W.3d 257, 262 (Tex. 2008).  
D. Opposing Counsel’s Contradictory Behavior  
17. Cooper L. Carter’s contradictory behavior warrants particular 
attention, like a  character in a novel whose actions never quite align with their 
words:  She zealously defended her client by filing an answer to the SAPCR in this 
Court, thereby submitting to this Court’s jurisdiction, only to then influence this 
Court  to refuse to hear Petitioner’s  properly filed motion by representing that she 
would file a  motion to consolidate in the 322nd Court , which would be moot by 
statute.  
18. She had abandoned the divorce case for nearly a year, filing nothing 
since April  24, 2024, only to suddenly reappear precisely when I sought 
emergency relief for  the children —like a firefighter who ignores a smoldering 
house for months, only to rush in when someone else calls for help. She failed to respond to a Rule 12 motion challenging her authority to represent  
the Respondent, her silence speaking volumes about the nature of her  
representation.  She subsequently filed an improper motion to consolidate in the 
322nd Court  without first filing the required motion to transfer, putting the  
procedural cart  before the horse.  She is now claiming unavailability until late 
April in the 322nd Court, creating unnecessary delay after using the urgency of consolidation to block Petitioner’s  emergency  hearing.

14 
 19. This pattern demonstrates a tactical attempt to manipulate both courts’ 
dockets  to prevent me from obtaining a timely hearing on Petitioner’s  properly 
filed emergency  motion. It’s a shell game played with the  children’s welfare as 
the prize.  This Court should not allow itself to be used as an instrument in such 
procedural  gamesmanship, particularly when it involves a failure to perform a 
ministerial duty required by law and when children’s welfare is at stake.  
IV. CONCLUSION 
 
This Court’s refusal to hear Petitioner’s properly filed motion constitutes a  
failure to perform a ministerial duty for which there is no adequate remedy  
by appeal. The proper legal procedure requires a motion to transfer to be  
filed and granted before any motion to consolidate can be considered, and by 
answering the SAPCR petition in this Court, Respondent submitted to this  
Court’s jurisdiction. 
The children who are the subject of this proceeding are suffering 
immediate and  ongoing harm while procedural issues remain unresolved. Each 
day that passes  without addressing the emergency concerns raised in Petitioner’s 
TRO is a day  of certain  damage to the children’s psychological well -being and 
development.  
Petitioner once heard it said that the true measure of a society is found in 
how it  treats its most vulnerable members. By that measure, the procedural 
labyrinth that has prevented this Court from hearing Petitioner’s emergency

15 
 motion speaks  volumes about how far we have strayed from the ideal of justice. 
The children — innocent, vulnerable, and deserving of the Court’s protection—
have instead  become collateral damage in a game of procedural chess.  
Petitioner provides this petition not out of anger or vindictiveness, but out 
of that quiet, heavy disappointment that settles in a person’s bones when they’ve  
done everything by the book only to find the book itself has been shelved away.  
Petitioner followed the rules. He reiterates that h e honored the procedures . He 
placed his faith in  a system that promised justice would flow like water, clear a nd 
unobstructed, to those who seek it properly.  
Petitioner asks this Court to remember that behind every case number, 
behind every filing, behind every procedural rule, there are  often  real children 
with real lives  that continue whether the courts act or not. Time doesn’t stop for 
them while  adults sort out procedural disagreements. They grow, they hurt, they 
form  memories and impressions that will shape them for a lifetime.  
As Mark Twain might have observed, the difference between justice 
served and  justice delayed is the difference between a father’s presence and his 
absence,  between children thriving and children suffering, between following the 
law and  merely gesturing toward it.  
V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF  
 
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED , Petitioner respectfully 
requests that this Court correct its error sua sponte, recognize the seriousness of

16 
 this situation, and grant relief without delay given the extraordinary circumstances 
of this case. Petitioner specifically  requests that this Court:  
i. Immediately grant the  attached proposed order requesting an 
emergency TRO preventing the Respondent from barring Petitioner’s access to the matrimonial home located at 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148 pursuant to Texas Family Code § 105.001(b) and serve the order on all parties of record through the EFM pursuant to rule 21a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure ;  
ii. Have the parties confer with the court coordinator to set this matter 
for a hearing within 14 days from the signing of the order, and require Respondent’s written response no later than 7 days before the hearing;  
iii. Take judicial notice that  this Court has personal jurisdiction over 
the respondent  to issue a TRO  given her response to the original 
SAPCR;   
iv. Take judicial notice  that no opposition to the  requested  relief 
appears on record;  
v. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and necessary to protect the best interests of the children, under § 153.002 and aid the parties in satisfy ing Texas  State policy under § 
153.001.

17 
  Petitioner emphasizes that this request is urgent and narrowly 
tailored to avoid further procedural delay that places the children at risk.
