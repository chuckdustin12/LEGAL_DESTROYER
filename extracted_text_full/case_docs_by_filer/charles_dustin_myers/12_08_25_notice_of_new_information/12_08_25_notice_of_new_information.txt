To the H onor able J ustices of t he Supreme C ourt, 
I am writing to s ubmit new a nd critical information p ertinent to  my pe tition 
for review in the above -refere nced case. On June 2nd, 2024 at 3: 51 P. M. , I received 
a phone call from Margie Wilson, the grandmother of my wife and the landlord 
of our residence at 6641 Anne Court. Mrs. Wilson provided the following 
criti
cal information: 
1.Mrs. Wilson confirmed that my wife, Morgan Michelle Myers, has 
not been paying the rent for our residence for the past few months, 
despite being required to do so by the temporary court orders.
2.Mr
s. Wilson expressed concerns about the health and wellbeing of my  
children, specifically Mara, as Morgan has not obtained the required  
insurance for them and has not tak en them to see a doctor.
3.Mr
s. Wilson mentioned that Morgan has b een acting “n ot like herself”, 
raising concerns about her ability to provide proper care for our 
childr
en.
Additionally, I must inform the court that I will be without a residence 
starting July 1st, 2024. I have been staying temporarily at my grandmother’s house, 
but she has sold the home, and they will close on July 1st, which is when I will be required to leave. My inability to provide for my children without a stable home

furth er exacerb ates the situation, m aking it criti cal for the court t o reconsid er the 
current ord ers. 
I am unable to obtain a formal affidavit from Mrs. Wilson due to her 
request for confidentiality. However, I believe it is imperative that the court is 
made aware of these developments as they are directly relevant to the issues 
under review, particularly the enforcement and fairness of the family court 
orders. 
I respectfully request that this new information be considered in the 
review of my case. If needed, I am willing to testify under oath regarding this 
conversatio n and provide any further information the court may req uire. 
This situ ation is exactly what I h ad feared as outlined within th e pleadin gs 
on record. 
Despite our differen ces, the grandparents and I have always maintain ed an 
amicab le relationship, and the call receiv ed displays our join t concern over the 
Children in this case. 
Thank you for your attention to this urgen t matter.
