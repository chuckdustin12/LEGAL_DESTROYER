No#:   322-744263-23  
I.INTRODUCTION
1.A Year  of Unjust Exile
On January 16, 2024, this Court authorized the removal of Respondent from his own 
home—a decision that, to this day (January 1 3, 2025), remains unexplained. Despite 
Respondent’s diligent pursuit of relief from multiple courts and encountering numerous judicial 
officers ( including the Second Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court of Texas, the Honorable 8th 
Administrative  Regional Judge, t he H onorable Justice Lee Gabriel, the  Northern D istrict of  
Texas, and now the Western District of Oklahoma), not one venue has addressed the glaring 
inconsistencies and fraud unde rpinning the orders that separated a father from his children 
without justification.   
2.Complete Lack of Opposition or Defense
No one—neither the Petitioner, M organ M ichell e Myers , nor her counsel—has bothered 
to dispute Respondent’s sworn allegations or offer any substantive defense . They have failed to 
participate in discover y, neglected to provide legitimate service , and have offered no rebuttal to 
the detailed f actual r ecord es tablishing fra ud. This utter silence speaks volumes, particularly 
given the life-altering stakes for Respondent and the children who have lost a parent’s day-to-day 
presence in contrast to this State’s policy. See Tex. Fam. Code sec. 153.001. M.1467 M.1467
M.1467 M.1467 M.1467 M.1467

3 3.Unprec edented and Ongoing Harm
Respondent has lost his family, his home, and his means of earning a livelihood. He has 
also lost precious, irreplaceable time in his children’s lives. This Court’s removal order 
effectively r ewarded P etitioner’s de ceptive pleadings —pleadings  that all evide nce shows w ere 
purpose-built to conceal her own misconduct and to deny Respondent even a semblance of due 
process or  a say in the dissolution of his eight- year marriage. 
4.Urgent Appeal for Corrective Action
Respondent implores this Honorable Court—a nd any judicial authority reading this 
record—t o immediately rectify this travesty. The legal system’s core responsibility is to 
protect children’s best interests and uphold fairness  in family disputes . Here, neither principle 
has been honored. This matter demands an urgent remedy. See  Tex. Fam. Code sec. 153.002 
II.DECEPTION UPON THE CO URT
5.Four Filings in Rapi d Succession
The Petitioner, MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS, approached the 322nd District Court of  
Tarrant County a total of three times between December 14th, 2023, and December 22nd, 2023, 
where she requested an e x-parte order of protection, f iled an affidavit of inability to pay court 
costs, an original petition for divorce , and a n application for a standard protective order. A true 
and accurate copy of these documents has been attached for reference. True and accurate copies 
of these documents have been attached hereto. 
6.Covert Preparations and Assistance
Immediately a fter the  first filing  (December 14, 20 23), Petitioner opened a new bank 
account. She then traveled t o Yukon, Oklahoma , where her relative, D an Branthoover , admitte dly 
assisted her in prepari ng subsequent filings designed to achieve the very result we see today—M.1468 M.1468
M.1468 M.1468 M.1468 M.1468

4 Respondent’s abrupt removal from his home. Mr. Branthoover is now facing a suit  in the Western 
District of Oklahoma for his pivotal role in perpetuating the fraud that has so grievously harmed 
Respondent and the children and wit h clear malicious intent.  
F ALSE REPRESENTATION OF THE CASE BEING UN -CONTESTED  
7.Illusion of Agreement from the Start
The first knowingly false document presented came in the form of a request for an 
attorney to revi ew the Petitioner’ s paperwork where she claimed that the case was uncontested. 
This only came after an emergency protective order request, calling into question her credibility from the start.  
AFFIDAVIT OF INABILITY TO P AY COURT COSTS  
8.Sworn Misrepresentations
The Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers , declared under penalty of perjury that she 
could not afford the $400 filing fee for divorce and that the children “relied solely on her income.” Yet the record conclusively shows that Respondent  was the primary provider. Further, 
Petitioner’s own texts confirm she had far more than enough funds at the time of filing. Specifically:   
1.On December 16, 2023, Petitioner and her relative, Dan Branthoover, both openly
admitted via text message that Petitioner moved marital funds into her personal
account. This is corroborated by statements from both Branthoover and Petitioner
acknowledging the transfer via text message.
2.Petitioner then proceeded to lie on the December 18, 2023, Affidavit of Inability to
Pay, claiming she had “only $20” in her bank account.
9.The Conversion of $1,576.00 and Additional DeceptionsM.1469 M.1469
M.1469 M.1469 M.1469 M.1469

5 Supported by bank statements and text message evidence, there is no doubt Petitioner had 
more than sufficient resources to cover court costs at the time she claimed indigency. These facts 
have been pleaded numerous times without any rebuttal from Petitioner. As such, the case should be dismissed under § 13.001 of the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code , because her affidavit 
was indisputably falsified. 10. Fictitious Expenses
In her affidavit, Petitioner also represented to the Court that she personally paid for both 
car payments —a 2023 Mazda CX-5 and a 2020 Mazda3 as well as $800 in monthly rent plus 
utilities . These statements are demonstrably untrue. Bank records prove that Respondent, not 
Petitioner, was the primary financial manager covering these obligations. Moreover, Respondent is currently paying for these same vehicles that Petitioner claimed she alone was financing , one 
of which has been damaged by the Petitioner. Not only was Petitioner never solely responsible for these payments, but her own text messages show that on December 16, 2023, she withdrew or transferred significant funds to herself and then declared under oath—just two days later —that 
she was penniless and could not afford the $400 court costs. 
Taken together, these glaring contradictions demolish the veracity of Petitioner’s 
“indigency” claim  and warrant dismissal.  
THE ORIGINAL PETITION FOR DIVORCE  
11.Petitioner’ s Contradictory Statements
The divorce petition, filed on December 18, 2023, contained allegations that a protective 
order had been requested on December 14 but remained undecided, while simultaneously asserting that an “active” protective order existed finding family violence, thus justifying a 60-day waiver. These allegations are inconsistent and should have alerted the Court to Petitioner’s M.1470 M.1470
M.1470 M.1470 M.1470 M.1470

6 lack of credibility. Moreover, Texas Family Code § 6.405(b) requires attaching any protective 
order referenced in a divorce petition, which Petitioner failed to do. 6.405(b)’ s protections were 
overlooked by the court, as no hearing should have ever taken place on January 16th, 2024, given 
this claimed order of protection was never could not ever have been presented to the court because it has never existed.  
12.Critical Misstep by the Court
Had the Court recognized these glaring inconsistencies—or merely reviewed the 
supporting documents—it would have avoided its own January 16, 2024, order expelling Respondent from the marital residence.  
THE APPLICATION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER 
13.The Second, Frivolous R equest
On December 22, 2023, Petitioner pursued yet another protective order, despite having 
just claimed —four days earlier —that she already had one in effect. This confounding behavior 
shows that Petitioner was bent on amassing multiple orders to ensure Respondent’s removal, despite no demonstrable threat or legitimate need  to do so. 
14.Contradictory Conduct That Undermines Credibility
 Text messages and photographs from December 22, 2023, depict Petitioner laughing and 
playing with the children in the marital home alongside Respondent—the very person she allegedly “feared.” No credible evidence has ever been presented to support her allegations of family violence. Instead, the protective- order filings clearly appear more  like strategic 
maneuvers to lock in “temporary orders,” later, which is exactly wha t occurred . Perhaps most 
alarming is that the current orders are purported to be agreed , just as the case was first purported 
to be uncontested. The level of injustice  here must be addressed.  M.1471 M.1471
M.1471 M.1471 M.1471 M.1471

7 THE CURRENT TEMPORARY ORDERS  
15.Mischaracterized “Agreed” Orders
These temporary orders cite a motion never served on Respondent and a hearing that 
never occurred. The orders erroneously state Respondent “agreed,” yet only Petitioner’s 
signature appears. This deficiency alone robs the orders of procedural validity. 16.Lack of Substantive Participation by Petitioner’ s Counsel
Petitioner’s counsel filed no substantive pleadings and participated minimally in court—
mainly through baseless objections blocking Respondent’s right to cross- examine Petitioner. 
Unsurprisingly, these “temporary” orders contain multiple factual inaccuraci es and remain 
uncontested only because Petitioner and her counsel have refused to litigate the matter on the merits.   
17.An Engineered Narrative to Justify Removing Respondent
Respondent’s evidence—bank statements, text logs, phone records—reveals Petitioner’s 
true motive: to conceal her misconduct, secure the marital residence, and isolate Respondent from the children during the holidays, all while ignoring basic rules of discovery and honesty to live out a fantasy that had been culminating for over a year. 
III. PETITIONER’S MOTIVE
DEBBIE PRICE AND DAMEN KAZLAUSKAS  
18.Why Go to Such Extremes?
Why woul d a spouse fabricate claims of needing protection, systematically lie under oath 
about her finances, and manipulate the judicial system? The answer emerged on December 12 , 
2023, when Respondent discovered over 16,500 text messages between Petitioner and two individuals outside the marriage, Debbie Price and Damen Kazlauskas . Faced with the imminent M.1472 M.1472
M.1472 M.1472 M.1472 M.1472

8 
 exposure of her extramarital relationships—and the looming scrutiny of the courts—Petitioner 
embarked on a frantic quest to lock Respondent out of the marital home and silence any questions about her own wrongdoing. 19. Sudden Divorce Announcement  
On December 1, 2023, Petitioner abruptly told Respondent she intended to divorce him, 
without any prior discussion or warning. Initially, she claimed her dissatisfaction stemmed solely from how he “talked” to her, only to expand her grievances to the entire marriage—including family vacations once touted as joyful. This immediate about- face suggests Petitioner was 
already laying the groundwork for her broader scheme. 20. The Phone Records and AT&T Data  
 
By December 12, 2023, Respondent delved into the couple’s joint AT&T account, 
recalling Petitioner’s previous infidelity  to seek answers  given her unwillingness to 
communicate . The phone and text logs—registered under Petitioner’s grandmother’s name at the 
time—confirmed an enormous volume of messages with Price and Kazlauskas, rendering 
Petitioner’s evolving divorce rationales unconvincing. 
 
TEXT RECORD S (VOLUME)  
 
The data from the text records are presented from a volume standpoint alone and  does not 
contain the context of the m essages. Given the sheer amount of communication that has taken 
place between the Petitioner, Price, an d Kazlauskas – the context of the messages is 
overshadowed by the massive level of communication between these parties.  
21. The Text Dataset Structure  
The structure of the text data is presented in the following format found in the table 
below. Petitioner is aware o f this dis covery, an d has been presented the charts below. M.1473 M.1473

ANALYZING THE TEXT RECORDS  
22.Respondent’ s Data Expertise
Respondent’s professional background in data solutions allowed him to compile these 
logs into visually compelling evidence—demonstrating Petitioner’s exponentially increasing communications with Price and Kazlauskas from late 2022 onward. 
Each line tracks Petitioner’s interactions with her top 25 contacts between October 2022 
and December 2023 . The lines labeled “debbie” and “damen” soar above the rest, confirming 
tens of thousands of texts exchanged. A “flat line” appears after December 15, 2024—the same weekend Dan Branthoover  purchased Petitioner a secondary phone, ostensibly for “protection,” 
but in reality to hide her continuing communications. M.1474 M.1474

23.Astonishing Communication Volume
Over  10,000 messages with Debbie and more than 6,000 with Damen spell out a deeply 
involved relationship that overshadows all other contacts. In a typical marriage, one might expect 
the most communication to be  with family, but here, it is with two outsiders —raising the strong 
inference of intimacy  and influence. 
24.Disregard for Family Obligations
The slope of these lines proves that Petitioner’s daily communications revolved around 
these individuals, at the expense of her responsibilities as a spouse and mother. Once discovered, Petitioner hastened to block Respondent from accessing more evidence by obtaining a second phone. 25.“Emotional Support” Doesn ’t Explain Away These InteractionsM.1475 M.1475

11 No reasonable spouse would shrug off these communications as harmless. Damen is now 
a near -constant presence around the children. Petitioner cannot simply label this as “support” 
when the data proves a staggering level of day- and-night messaging on a daily basis.

27.Unusual  Late -Night M essages
FIGURE 3 zeroes in on overnight or e arly-morning texting patterns. We see that  
“damen” has over 2,000 messages between 10 PM and 6 AM. These are hours typically 
reserved for work or private time with one’s spouse.  Repeated overnight messaging to the 
same individuals points to late-night conversations, which might indicate romantic o r intimate 
exchanges, or at the very least a strong emotional bond that compels this person to stay 
connected in the middle of the night. Such nocturnal communication is a classic warning sign M.1477 M.1477

13 when exploring marital fidelity or emotional boundaries. Consistent late-night contact that 
dwarfs normal daytime communication with the spouse suggests secrecy or intimacy. This is 
especially concerning when you add in that the Petitioner would visit these individuals on average 18 hours per week leading up to the divorce announcement on December 1, 2023.

Notice that some contacts see surges in messages early in the morning or late at night; others peak during midday. “debbie” and “damen” appear to have high levels of communication during typical sleeping hours and again in the morning, which could imply a pattern of continuous or recurring contact across day and night.

occurred almost constantly. The data highlights a consistent pattern of engagement a cross most 
waking hours, with significant activity spilling into late-night and early-morning periods—times 
traditionally reserved for rest, family, or private matters.  The overwhelming focus on these 
individuals detracted from her time and energy for familial responsibilities, including her duties 
as a spouse and parent. This imbalance calls into question her priorities during this period, and M.1479 M.1479

FIGURE 6: OUTLIER DETECTION  
30.Identifying Key Spikes
In data analysis, an outlier  is a data point that significantly differs from the rest of the 
dataset. It represents an unusual or extreme event that stands out from typical patterns or trends. 
Outliers often indicate anomalies, irregular behavior, or important events that warrant clo ser 
examination. 
 Here, outliers in the data correspond to events critical to Petitioner’s agenda—such as 
December 12 (Respondent’s discovery of these messages) and December 14 (her initial ex parte request). These spikes illustrate reactionary upticks in communication designed to manage or conceal her wrongdoing and appear in red and purple . 
The evidence is clear and troubling. Data reveals a sustained and excessive pattern of 
communication between the Petitioner and Debbie Price and Damen Kazlauskas, far exceeding M.1480 M.1480

16 casual relationships. These interactions, often late at night and early morning, detracted from her 
family responsibilities and raises serious concerns about her priorities and judgment. 31.Introducing Strangers to the Children
Adding to the concern, Kazlauskas is now frequently around the children and has taken 
them places alone—behavior that is unprecedented and raises questions about the appropriateness of his involvement, and is particularly  sickening given he was rarely involved in 
their lives prior to this litigation  commencing. 
32.Accountability in Silence
Petitioner’s refusal to address these factual allegations,  and the failure of her counsel to 
defend the claims against her  combined with her legal maneuvers evidences a strategy of 
obfuscation and evasion. This Court must not allow a litigant to exploit its processes for such improper ends. 
IV .RELIEF AS A MATTER OF LAW
Despite Respondent’s diligent, repeated pleas, the Court has yet to intervene. The record 
establishes a prima facie case for relief as a matter of law —no reasonable factfinder  could view 
these undisputed facts and deny the injustice at hand. The current situation contradicts these mandates, as the children who once had continuous and frequent access to both parents now only have access to one.  
Texas law prioritizes frequent, meaningful contact between children and both parents. 
Currently, the children see Petitioner’s new associate (Kazlauskas) more than their own father, who has been shut out without any legitimate legal foundation. The Respondent urges the reviewing body of this document to swiftly restore justice  and peace to  the Children’s lives.  M.1481 M.1481

17 V . CONCLUSION
Respondent was the primary caregiver for his children, yet on January 16, 2024, he was 
summarily ousted from their lives —based on Petitioner’s fabricated affidavits and contradictory 
statements. The fiasco has destroyed the family’s financial stability and subjected the children to 
confusion and distress. The P etitioner  has lied to the Court, her own family, and, worst of all, her 
children. She has leveraged erroneous judicial rulings to further her clandestine relationships with Debbie Price and Damen Kazlauskas , evidencing a profound disregard for her children’s 
needs.  Time and again, Respondent has requested only transparency and proper procedure— yet 
time continues to pass, compounding the damage. The situation remains stuck where it began, with the Court’s unexamined orders fueling Petitioner’s unscrupulous agenda at the children’s expense.  This court now possesses all of the facts necessary to restore wha t has been wrongfully 
taken.  
VI. PRAYER FOR EXPEDITED  RELIEF
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Respondent Charles Myers  respectfully 
requests this Court grant the following expedited relief, in line with the children’s best interests: 
1. Order Respondent’s return to 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148, with the option
for Petitioner to cohabit or move next door while Respondent transitions to nearby housing and re-establishes his business. This arrangement corrects the current unjust separation and ensures 
both parents remain available to the children during the pendency of the case.  
2. The respondent respectfully requests that the court t ake notice that Petitioner’s counsel
has, at no point, engaged in discovery, conferred properly, or produced substantive filings in contravention of fundamental procedural rules. M.1482 M.1482

18 3. Recognize Petitioner’s unequivocal lies to the Court—her false claims of indigency,
misrepresentations about protective orders, and reliance on outside assistance to engineer 
fraudulent pleadings. 
4.Note that Petitioner converted joint-marital funds shortly before perjuring herself
regarding alleged poverty. Such conduct warrants immediate dismissal or sanctions under Tex. 
Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 13.001. 
5. Grant any additional relief, legal or equitable, that the Court deems just and proper
under these extraordinary circumstances.  
Respectfully submitted,
