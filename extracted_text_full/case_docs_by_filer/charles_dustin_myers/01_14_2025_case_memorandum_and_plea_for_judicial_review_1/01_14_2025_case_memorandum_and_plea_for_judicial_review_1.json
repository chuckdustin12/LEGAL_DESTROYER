Despite \nRespondent\u2019s diligent pursuit of relief from multiple courts and encountering numerous judicial \nofficers ( including the Second Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court of Texas, the Honorable 8th \nAdministrative  Regional Judge, t he H onorable Justice Lee Gabriel, the  Northern D istrict of  \nTexas, and now the Western District of Oklahoma), not one venue has addressed the glaring \ninconsistencies and fraud unde rpinning the orders that separated a father from his children \nwithout justification.   \n2.Complete Lack of Opposition or Defense\nNo one\u2014neither the Petitioner, M organ M ichell e Myers , nor her counsel\u2014has bothered \nto dispute Respondent\u2019s sworn allegations or offer any substantive defense . They have failed to \nparticipate in discover y, neglected to provide legitimate service , and have offered no rebuttal to \nthe detailed f actual r ecord es tablishing fra ud. This utter silence speaks volumes, particularly \ngiven the life-altering stakes for Respondent and the children who have lost a parent\u2019s day-to-day \npresence in contrast to this State\u2019s policy.

True and accurate copies \nof these documents have been attached hereto. \n6.Covert Preparations and Assistance\nImmediately a fter the  first filing  (December 14, 20 23), Petitioner opened a new bank \naccount.

Mr. Branthoover is now facing a suit  in the Western \nDistrict of Oklahoma for his pivotal role in perpetuating the fraud that has so grievously harmed \nRespondent and the children and wit h clear malicious intent.  \nF ALSE REPRESENTATION OF THE CASE BEING UN -CONTESTED  \n7.Illusion of Agreement from the Start\nThe first knowingly false document presented came in the form of a request for an \nattorney to revi ew the Petitioner\u2019 s paperwork where she claimed that the case was uncontested. \nThis only came after an emergency protective order request, calling into question her credibility from the start.  \nAFFIDAVIT OF INABILITY TO P AY COURT COSTS  \n8.Sworn Misrepresentations\nThe Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers , declared under penalty of perjury that she \ncould not afford the $400 filing fee for divorce and that the children \u201crelied solely on her income.\u201d Yet the record conclusively shows that Respondent  was the primary provider. Further, \nPetitioner\u2019s own texts confirm she had far more than enough funds at the time of filing. Specifically:   \n1.On December 16, 2023, Petitioner and her relative, Dan Branthoover, both openly\nadmitted via text message that Petitioner moved marital funds into her personal\naccount. This is corroborated by statements from both Branthoover and Petitioner\nacknowledging the transfer via text message.\n2.Petitioner then proceeded to lie on the December 18, 2023, Affidavit of Inability to\nPay, claiming she had \u201conly $20\u201d in her bank account.\n9.The Conversion of $1,576.00 and Additional DeceptionsM.1469 M.1469\nM.1469 M.1469 M.1469 M.1469",

      "text": "5 Supported by bank statements and text message evidence, there is no doubt Petitioner had \nmore than sufficient resources to cover court costs at the time she claimed indigency. These facts \nhave been pleaded numerous times without any rebuttal from Petitioner. As such, the case should be dismissed under \u00a7 13.001 of the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code , because her affidavit \nwas indisputably falsified. 10. Fictitious Expenses\nIn her affidavit, Petitioner also represented to the Court that she personally paid for both \ncar payments \u2014a 2023 Mazda CX-5 and a 2020 Mazda3 as well as $800 in monthly rent plus \nutilities . These statements are demonstrably untrue. Bank records prove that Respondent, not \nPetitioner, was the primary financial manager covering these obligations. Moreover, Respondent is currently paying for these same vehicles that Petitioner claimed she alone was financing , one \nof which has been damaged by the Petitioner. Not only was Petitioner never solely responsible for these payments, but her own text messages show that on December 16, 2023, she withdrew or transferred significant funds to herself and then declared under oath\u2014just two days later \u2014that \nshe was penniless and could not afford the $400 court costs. \nTaken together, these glaring contradictions demolish the veracity of Petitioner\u2019s \n\u201cindigency\u201d claim  and warrant dismissal.  \nTHE ORIGINAL PETITION FOR DIVORCE  \n11.Petitioner\u2019 s Contradictory Statements\nThe divorce petition, filed on December 18, 2023, contained allegations that a protective \norder had been requested on December 14 but remained undecided, while simultaneously asserting that an \u201cactive\u201d protective order existed finding family violence, thus justifying a 60-day waiver. These allegations are inconsistent and should have alerted the Court to Petitioner\u2019s M.1470 M.1470\nM.1470 M.1470 M.1470 M.1470",

Moreover, Texas Family Code \u00a7 6.405(b) requires attaching any protective \norder referenced in a divorce petition, which Petitioner failed to do. 6.405(b)\u2019 s protections were \noverlooked by the court, as no hearing should have ever taken place on January 16th, 2024, given \nthis claimed order of protection was never could not ever have been presented to the court because it has never existed.  \n12.Critical Misstep by the Court\nHad the Court recognized these glaring inconsistencies\u2014or merely reviewed the \nsupporting documents\u2014it would have avoided its own January 16, 2024, order expelling Respondent from the marital residence.  \nTHE APPLICATION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER \n13.The Second, Frivolous R equest\nOn December 22, 2023, Petitioner pursued yet another protective order, despite having \njust claimed \u2014four days earlier \u2014that she already had one in effect. This confounding behavior \nshows that Petitioner was bent on amassing multiple orders to ensure Respondent\u2019s removal, despite no demonstrable threat or legitimate need  to do so. \n14.Contradictory Conduct That Undermines Credibility\n Text messages and photographs from December 22, 2023, depict Petitioner laughing and \nplaying with the children in the marital home alongside Respondent\u2014the very person she allegedly \u201cfeared.\u201d No credible evidence has ever been presented to support her allegations of family violence. Instead, the protective- order filings clearly appear more  like strategic \nmaneuvers to lock in \u201ctemporary orders,\u201d later, which is exactly wha t occurred . Perhaps most \nalarming is that the current orders are purported to be agreed , just as the case was first purported \nto be uncontested. The level of injustice  here must be addressed.

The orders erroneously state Respondent \u201cagreed,\u201d yet only Petitioner\u2019s \nsignature appears. This deficiency alone robs the orders of procedural validity. 16.Lack of Substantive Participation by Petitioner\u2019 s Counsel\nPetitioner\u2019s counsel filed no substantive pleadings and participated minimally in court\u2014\nmainly through baseless objections blocking Respondent\u2019s right to cross- examine Petitioner. \nUnsurprisingly, these \u201ctemporary\u201d orders contain multiple factual inaccuraci es and remain \nuncontested only because Petitioner and her counsel have refused to litigate the matter on the merits.   \n17.An Engineered Narrative to Justify Removing Respondent\nRespondent\u2019s evidence\u2014bank statements, text logs, phone records\u2014reveals Petitioner\u2019s \ntrue motive: to conceal her misconduct, secure the marital residence, and isolate Respondent from the children during the holidays, all while ignoring basic rules of discovery and honesty to live out a fantasy that had been culminating for over a year. \nIII.

Sudden Divorce Announcement  \nOn December 1, 2023, Petitioner abruptly told Respondent she intended to divorce him, \nwithout any prior discussion or warning. Initially, she claimed her dissatisfaction stemmed solely from how he \u201ctalked\u201d to her, only to expand her grievances to the entire marriage\u2014including family vacations once touted as joyful. This immediate about- face suggests Petitioner was \nalready laying the groundwork for her broader scheme. 20. The Phone Records and AT&T Data  \n \nBy December 12, 2023, Respondent delved into the couple\u2019s joint AT&T account, \nrecalling Petitioner\u2019s previous infidelity  to seek answers  given her unwillingness to \ncommunicate . The phone and text logs\u2014registered under Petitioner\u2019s grandmother\u2019s name at the \ntime\u2014confirmed an enormous volume of messages with Price and Kazlauskas, rendering \nPetitioner\u2019s evolving divorce rationales unconvincing. \n \nTEXT RECORD S (VOLUME)  \n \nThe data from the text records are presented from a volume standpoint alone and  does not \ncontain the context of the m essages.

It represents an unusual or extreme event that stands out from typical patterns or trends. \nOutliers often indicate anomalies, irregular behavior, or important events that warrant clo ser \nexamination. \n Here, outliers in the data correspond to events critical to Petitioner\u2019s agenda\u2014such as \nDecember 12 (Respondent\u2019s discovery of these messages) and December 14 (her initial ex parte request). These spikes illustrate reactionary upticks in communication designed to manage or conceal her wrongdoing and appear in red and purple . \nThe evidence is clear and troubling. Data reveals a sustained and excessive pattern of \ncommunication between the Petitioner and Debbie Price and Damen Kazlauskas, far exceeding M.1480 M.1480\nM.1480 M.1480 M.1480 M.1480Outlier Detection in Interaction Trends \nDebbie X \nDarnen X X \nX Debbie Outhe,s )( )( \n100 )( )( )( Oamen Outlie.rs X X \n80 )( \n\"' C: \n0 X ,'f )( \n\u00b7.:; \n~ )( )( xx \n.!J 60 x )( \nE )( X \n)( \n0 )( .. \noi X \",i<x )( .c X \nE 40 >;c :, z l \nII> \n20 \" t 11X jl \nX '\"' \n0 \n2022-09 2022-11 2023-01 2023-03 2023-05 2023-07 2023-09 2023-ll 2024-01 \nDate",

      "text": "16 casual relationships. These interactions, often late at night and early morning, detracted from her \nfamily responsibilities and raises serious concerns about her priorities and judgment. 31.Introducing Strangers to the Children\nAdding to the concern, Kazlauskas is now frequently around the children and has taken \nthem places alone\u2014behavior that is unprecedented and raises questions about the appropriateness of his involvement, and is particularly  sickening given he was rarely involved in \ntheir lives prior to this litigation  commencing. \n32.Accountability in Silence\nPetitioner\u2019s refusal to address these factual allegations,  and the failure of her counsel to \ndefend the claims against her  combined with her legal maneuvers evidences a strategy of \nobfuscation and evasion. This Court must not allow a litigant to exploit its processes for such improper ends. \nIV .RELIEF AS A MATTER OF LAW\nDespite Respondent\u2019s diligent, repeated pleas, the Court has yet to intervene. The record \nestablishes a prima facie case for relief as a matter of law \u2014no reasonable factfinder  could view \nthese undisputed facts and deny the injustice at hand. The current situation contradicts these mandates, as the children who once had continuous and frequent access to both parents now only have access to one.  \nTexas law prioritizes frequent, meaningful contact between children and both parents. \nCurrently, the children see Petitioner\u2019s new associate (Kazlauskas) more than their own father, who has been shut out without any legitimate legal foundation. The Respondent urges the reviewing body of this document to swiftly restore justice  and peace to  the Children\u2019s lives.  M.1481 M.1481\nM.1481 M.1481 M.1481 M.1481",

      "text": "17 V . CONCLUSION\nRespondent was the primary caregiver for his children, yet on January 16, 2024, he was \nsummarily ousted from their lives \u2014based on Petitioner\u2019s fabricated affidavits and contradictory \nstatements. The fiasco has destroyed the family\u2019s financial stability and subjected the children to \nconfusion and distress. The P etitioner  has lied to the Court, her own family, and, worst of all, her \nchildren. She has leveraged erroneous judicial rulings to further her clandestine relationships with Debbie Price and Damen Kazlauskas , evidencing a profound disregard for her children\u2019s \nneeds.  Time and again, Respondent has requested only transparency and proper procedure\u2014 yet \ntime continues to pass, compounding the damage. The situation remains stuck where it began, with the Court\u2019s unexamined orders fueling Petitioner\u2019s unscrupulous agenda at the children\u2019s expense.  This court now possesses all of the facts necessary to restore wha t has been wrongfully \ntaken.  \nVI. PRAYER FOR EXPEDITED  RELIEF\nWHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Respondent Charles Myers  respectfully \nrequests this Court grant the following expedited relief, in line with the children\u2019s best interests: \n1. Order Respondent\u2019s return to 6641 Anne Court, Watauga, Texas 76148, with the option\nfor Petitioner to cohabit or move next door while Respondent transitions to nearby housing and re-establishes his business. This arrangement corrects the current unjust separation and ensures \nboth parents remain available to the children during the pendency of the case.  \n2. The respondent respectfully requests that the court t ake notice that Petitioner\u2019s counsel\nhas, at no point, engaged in discovery, conferred properly, or produced substantive filings in contravention of fundamental procedural rules.
