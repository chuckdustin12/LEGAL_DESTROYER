Good morning,
 
The Motion to Consolidate just needs to be filed in the 322nd Divorce case and sent to their Judge to sign; no hearing
necessary, it’s a mandatory consolidation.

Ms. Wierzbicki, Mr . Carter ,
Thank you for the update. However , I must respectfully object to the assertion that this is a mandatory consolidation.
Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 174(a), consolidation is discretionary and not automatic where doing so would cause
delay , injustice, or prejudice to a party . Additionally , the Texas Supreme Court in Curtis v . Gibbs, 51 1 S.W .2d 263 (T ex.
1974) expressly carved out exceptions to dominant jurisdiction where:
The original case was filed in bad faith,
The case isn't been prosecuted;
Equity and justice require an independent forum.
All three conditions are present here. The SAPCR was filed in good faith after the 322nd case became procedurally
stalled and legally defective—with no Notice of Remand, no evidentiary rulings on the children, and pending dispositive
motions including unopposed requests for dismissal. 
It would be prejudicial to the children to consolidate a case that had no ability to proceed.
Thank you.
Respectfully ,
Charles Dustin Myers

Hello, 
This is Charles Dustin Myers, Petitioner in the above captioned cause, and I received an automated reply deferring me to
this email when originally reaching out to the Honorable Coordinator .
The original email's purpose was to inform the Honorable Coordinator that I had just received notification through the EFM
that the emergency ex-parte TRO had been accepted by the court.
I am following up to inquire about the status of the request.
I thank you for your attention to this urgent matter , and I will wait for further directive from the court to proceed accordingly .
As mentioned in the motion, the Respondent in this matter and her counsel of record have been duly notified of the relief
being sought and the motion itself, but have not responded to any attempts to communicate regarding this urgent matter .
Thank you and have a wonderful evening.

Please contact our of fice to patch me in for any calls that Judge would like to have.
 
Additionally , this case already is pending in the 322nd for a divorce proceeding regarding property and children matters.

To: Cooper Carter <coopercarter@majadmin.com>
Court staf f,
Ms. Carter ’s recent correspondence is improper for several reasons, and appears to be an attempt to delay or interfere
with proceedings in which she has otherwise failed to meaningfully participate in. The following reasons support this
statement:
1. An objection to consolidation is already on file and remains unopposed. It cites controlling Texas precedent. Any
suggestion that consolidation is agreed upon or inevitable is misleading. Instead, she should properly file with the court
why the consolidation is improper or at the very least argue against Petitioner's position.
 
2. Ms. Carter has not fulfilled her obligation under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 237a to file a Notice of Remand. Until
she does, she is prohibited from proceeding or filing anything in the 322nd District Court as they currently do not have
jurisdiction over this matter until this obligation is fulfilled.
3. Her authority to represent the Respondent remains under challenge pursuant to a Rule 12 motion filed September 20,
2024. No hearing has been held, no written statement of authority has been filed, and no ruling has been made. Until
resolved, Rule 12 bars her from participating in either proceeding.
4. Ms. Carter has not prosecuted the case in the 322nd District Court in over eight months. This inaction has prejudiced
the Petitioner and delayed resolution of urgent matters af fecting the children.
5. She has failed to file any objections, responsive pleadings, or legal arguments opposing the relief requested—including
the Emergency TRO now pending.
6. Rather than reaching out to Petitioner to resolve any scheduling conflict, Ms. Carter improperly attempted to influence
the court by email. This violates the spirit of cooperation required by the rules, particularly where her participation is
procedurally barred.
7. Ms. Carter ’s conduct appears designed to delay relief and subvert the best interest of the children, despite her failure to
oppose the requested relief in any meaningful way .
8. She has been provided with full notice of the Emergency TRO, the proposed order , supporting exhibits, and the time
and location of presentment. She has no legal basis to subvert Petitioner's due process rights.
In summary , Ms. Carter has not provided anything of substance in either Court, has not prosecuted the case, has not
argued on behalf of her client, or followed proper procedure.
Simply labeling the opposition as pro se and claiming that the consolidation will be filed without disclosing the above facts
is dishonest and should not be permitted as it will only cause further unnecessary delays to the relief being sought without
any substance being provided.
Again, all of these points have been argued in both courts, and it is her duty as counsel to handle these matters in
accordance with Texas Law .
These matters should be handled between the parties - not attempt to influence court staf f after hours.
The reason we are here in the first place is due to the above unanswered facts. Ms. Carter has had ample time to file an
objection, response, or counter argument, but has chosen not to do so.
It would've been far more appropriate for Ms. Carter to have reached out to me directly to discuss scheduling conflicts.
Prior to the latest email, there was no indication Ms. Carter intended to participate at all despite being provided with all
relevant materials.4/8/25, 11:49 AM Gmail - ITIO MORGAN CHILDREN, CAUSE NO. 233-765358-25 CL-12105

Court staf f,
Ms. Carter ’s recent correspondence is improper for several reasons, and appears to be an attempt to delay or interfere
with proceedings in which she has otherwise failed to meaningfully participate in. The following reasons support this
statement:
1. An objection to consolidation is already on file and remains unopposed. It cites controlling Texas precedent. Any
suggestion that consolidation is agreed upon or inevitable is misleading. Instead, she should properly file with the court
why the consolidation is improper or at the very least argue against Petitioner's position.
 
2. Ms. Carter has not fulfilled her obligation under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 237a to file a Notice of Remand. Until
she does, she is prohibited from proceeding or filing anything in the 322nd District Court as they currently do not have
jurisdiction over this matter until this obligation is fulfilled.
3. Her authority to represent the Respondent remains under challenge pursuant to a Rule 12 motion filed September 20,
2024. No hearing has been held, no written statement of authority has been filed, and no ruling has been made. Until
resolved, Rule 12 bars her from participating in either proceeding.
4. Ms. Carter has not prosecuted the case in the 322nd District Court in over eight months. This inaction has prejudiced
the Petitioner and delayed resolution of urgent matters af fecting the children.
5. She has failed to file any objections, responsive pleadings, or legal arguments opposing the relief requested—including
the Emergency TRO now pending.
6. Rather than reaching out to Petitioner to resolve any scheduling conflict, Ms. Carter improperly attempted to influence
the court by email. This violates the spirit of cooperation required by the rules, particularly where her participation is
procedurally barred.
7. Ms. Carter ’s conduct appears designed to delay relief and subvert the best interest of the children, despite her failure to
oppose the requested relief in any meaningful way .
8. She has been provided with full notice of the Emergency TRO, the proposed order , supporting exhibits, and the time
and location of presentment. She has no legal basis to subvert Petitioner's due process rights.
In summary , Ms. Carter has not provided anything of substance in either Court, has not prosecuted the case, has not
argued on behalf of her client, or followed proper procedure.
Simply labeling the opposition as pro se and claiming that the consolidation will be filed without disclosing the above facts
is dishonest and should not be permitted as it will only cause further unnecessary delays to the relief being sought without
any substance being provided.4/8/25, 11:49 AM Gmail - ITIO MORGAN CHILDREN, CAUSE NO. 233-765358-25 CL-12105

Good morning,
 
Mr. Myers appeared before me to schedule the hearing for the TRO; my apologies I did not realize this was that
same case.  We can go ahead and set the TRO with us, but most likely the case will be transferred prior to the
hearing date and the case needs to be transferred prior to that date.
 
Mr. Myers will be emailing with dates available for the hearing.
 
Thank you,

Additionally, since there is an objection to the consolidation, y’all will need to reach out to request how to proceed
with the 322nd as I am usure of their procedures.
