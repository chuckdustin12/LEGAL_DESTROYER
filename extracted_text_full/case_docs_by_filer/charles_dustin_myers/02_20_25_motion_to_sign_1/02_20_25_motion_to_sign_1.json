INTRODUCTION  \nProcedural Posture  \n1. This case cannot proceed further on a lawful basis due to multiple procedural violations by Petitioner\u2019s counsel, fraud on the court , and the total lack of \nopposition to Respondent\u2019s key motions. Petitioner and her counsel have failed to respond to or contest critical \ufb01lings, leaving the case in a legally untenable posture.  \nImmediate Relief Sought   \n2. Respondent urgently requests that the Court restore his parental rights and \nimmediately reinstate his exclusive possession of the marital residence. He further seeks an injunction to restrain Petitioner from any continued interference or \ndissipation of assets, and asks the Court to dismiss this action or, alternatively, to rule on all of Respondent\u2019s pending motions that stand unopposed.

The standing orders  in this case are tainted by misconduct  and should not be \nallowed to stand. Petitioner\u2019s counsel has failed to comply with mandatory e-\ufb01ling and e -service rules , has been unable to \ufb01le required procedural documents \n(such as the Notice of Remand that currently has this case grid -locked) to move the \ncase forward, and obtained prior \u201cagreed\u201d orders through misrepresentation of \nRespondent\u2019s consent .

MANDATORY E -FILING REQUIREMENTS VIOLATED  \nE-File and E -Service Required  \n4. Under Texas law, attorneys must utilize the electronic \ufb01ling system in jurisdictions where e -\ufb01ling is mandated. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 21(f)(1) provides that, \nexcept for limited exceptions, \u201cattorneys must electronically \ufb01le documents in \ncourts where electronic \ufb01ling has been mandated.\u201d  Likewise, Rule 21a(a)(1) \nrequires that any document electronically \ufb01led \u201cmust be served electronically",

These rules make e -\ufb01ling \nand e -service mandatory  in Tarrant County District Court proceedings.  \nCounsel\u2019s Non -Compliance  \n5. Petitioner\u2019s counsel has blatantly violated these requirements. She has failed to properly e-\ufb01le pleadings in this case and has not e -served Respondent with \ufb01lings \nas required. In fact, when counsel attempted to amend Petitioner\u2019s pleadings on \nJanuary 30, 2024, the document was not \ufb01led by counsel herself  at all \u2013 it had to \nbe \ufb01led on her behalf by her self -reported formal employer \u2013 Marx, Altman, & \nJohnson.  \n6.

OPPOSING COUNSEL CANNOT LEGALLY FILE OR PROSECUTE CASE \nCounsel\u2019s Filing Disability  \n7. Petitioner\u2019s counsel has demonstrated that she is procedurally incapable of \nprosecuting this case. As noted, her EFM account is apparently still tied to her prior \nlaw \ufb01rm,  registered under the email of COOPERCARTER@CANTEYHANGAR.COM , \nas evidenced by Exhibit 1 below,  preventing her from independently e -\ufb01ling \ndocuments on this Court\u2019s docket.

An attorney who cannot even \ufb01le pleadings properly \ncannot litigate a case in compliance with Texas procedure.  \nNo Notice of Remand \u2013 Case Stalled  \n9. The case\u2019s posture further illustrates counsel\u2019s inability to move the matter forward. \nRespondent removed this case to federal court on December 12, 2024; the federal \ncourt remanded it back to state court on December 17, 2024.

Respondent moved for summary judgment on the ground that Petitioner produced \nno evidence to support her claims (and notably, Petitioner also never answered Respondent\u2019s earlier emergency motion).

Petitioner has never served any discovery responses  to Respondent\u2019s admissions , requests for production, or \nother requests, nor did she respond to the motion to compel.

FRAUDULENT ORDERS AND LACK OF CONSENT  \nOrders Procured by Fraud/Misrepresentation  \n21.

Despite Respondent\u2019s lack of consent, the court proceeded to sign \nthe order, effectively adopting counsel\u2019s false representation of an agr eement that \ndid not exist , and where the terms differed from the earlier signed agreement which \nwas clearly contested by Respondent.  \nViolation of Rule 11 \u2013 No Enforceable Agreement",

Here, there was no written agreement \ufb01led that was signed by Respondent, nor\nany agreement stated on the record in open court with Respondent\u2019s consent.  In\nother words,  the only \u201cagreement\u201d was an outline read into the Associate Judge\u2019s\nReport on February 1, 2024, which Respondent\u2019s prior attorney pressured him to\nsign under duress (and which Respondent repudiated by \ufb01ring that attorney dayslater). Even that report set speci\ufb01c conditions (e.g. a written order to be drafted by\nRespondent\u2019s prior counsel,  and within a certain timeframe, which were never\nful\ufb01lled.

Texas law expressly recognizes that injunctive relief is appropriate to prevent irreparable harm to property or \ufb01nancial interests. Section 65.011 of the Texas Civil \nPractice and Remedies Code provides general grounds for injunctions. Notably, \n\u00a765.011(5)  permits a writ of injunction when \u201cirreparable injury to real or personal \nproperty is threatened irrespective of any remedy at law.\u201d  Here, that standard is met. \nRespondent\u2019s exclusion from the marital residence and business has placed real \nand personal pr operty at risk: the marital home (real property) is in jeopardy of \nwaste or  loss, and Respondent\u2019s personal property (including business assets, \ncon\ufb01dential records, and equipment located at the residence) is being controlled or and disposed of by Petitioner. This presents a threat of irreparable injury  because \nonce property is sold, lost, or the business is destroyed, Respondent cannot be made whole by monetary compensation alone.  \nNeed for Immediate Injunction  \n27. Given these circumstances, the Court should issue immediate injunctive relief to protect Respondent\u2019s property and \ufb01nancial interests.
