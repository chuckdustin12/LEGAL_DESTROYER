TO THE HONORABLE COURT:  
NOW COMES Charles Dustin Myers, Respondent in the above -referenced case, 
who respectfully submits this Request for Confirmation of Procedural Requirements . 
This request is filed as a procedural safeguard to ensure compliance with statutory 
requirements and to uphold transparency within these proceedings.  
I. Background and Purpose  
1. The Respondent respectfully seeks confirmation that Justice Lee Gabriel, presiding 
over matters in this case, has fulfilled all constitutionally and statutorily mandated 
requirements, specifically including the Oath of Office  and Anti -Bribery Oath  as 
prescribed by Article XVI, Section 1 of the Texas Constitution  and Texas Government 
Code §§ 25.0017 and 25.0018 . 
2. Texas Government Code § 25.0017(a)  states, “A person who is a retired or former 
judge shall, before accepting an assignment as a visiting judge of a statutory county court, take the oath of office required by the constitution and file the oath with the regional presiding judge.” Additional ly, § 25.0018(a)  mandates that when a retired or former 
judge is appointed as a visiting judge, the court clerk should enter in the administrative file a record showing that the required oath was administered and filed with the regional 
presiding judge.  
3. This request is submitted solely for procedural safety and transparency and is not 
intended as a challenge to the authority of the Court. Verification of these oaths is

requested to ensure a complete and accurate record, should this case proceed to future 
appellate review  and is in no manner aimed at disrespecting  the court or Justice Lee 
Gabriel . 
II. Request for Specific Documentation  
4. Accordingly, Respondent respectfully requests that the Clerk of the Court provide, as 
part of the official case record:  
i. A certified copy of Justice Lee Gabriel’s Oath of Office  and Anti -Bribery Oath , 
filed in compliance with Texas Government Code § 25.0017. 
ii. Confirmation that the record entry in the administrative file complies with Texas Government Code § 25.0018, confirming the administration and filing of the oath 
with the regional presiding judge.  
III. Conclusion  
This request is submitted in the interest of due process and procedural compliance. 
Respondent respectfully requests that this confirmation  be provided for review and  be 
added to the official case record to ensure transparency and uphold the principles of impartiality fundamental to the judicial process.  
Respectfully submitted, 
   /s/ Charles Dustin Myers
