STATEMENT  
I, Charles Dustin Myers, submit this unsworn declaration to recount the events since
December 1st, 2023, when my wife, Morgan Michelle Myers, unexpectedly declared
her wish for a divorce. The announcement was not only ill-timed but also perplexing in
its lack of substantiated reasoning or opportunity for reconciliation.
At noon that day, Morgan cited 'the way I talk to her' as her rationale for the divorce.
Despite her evolving reasons, I extended apologies and exhaustively sought resolution,
yet my every attempt to discuss our daughters' future and our family's welfare was met
with hostility or outright dismissal by Morgan.
The abruptness of Morgan's hostility compelled me to seek deeper insight. Upon
examining our AT&T records, I found an alarmingly high volume of communication
between Morgan and two individuals: Debbie and Damen. These findings were
troubling, especially given the children's scant interaction with Debbie's family despite
Morgan's extensive evening visits. When presented with this evidence, Morgan
downplayed its significance and persisted in her communications and visits, placing
them above resolving our marital issues.
After sharing my concerns with her grandparents, our landlords, the dynamics shifted
abruptly. Within days, Morgan began to systematically exclude me from the family
narrative surrounding the divorce.
The situation intensified on December 14th, 2023, with the involvement of Dan
Branthoover, her mother's boyfriend. Dan contacted me, purporting to mediate our
divorce impartially, yet his subsequent actions—advising Morgan, facilitating a transfer
of funds from our account to his PayPal, and overdrawn our joint account—belied his
stated intentions. This financial maneuvering, coupled with Dan's claim that Morgan is
"his client," despite lacking a legal license in Texas, underscores a deceitful
manipulation of the facts.
Morgan's subsequent visit to Dan's in Oklahoma for the divorce petition preparation
and the acquisition of a second phone coincided with a conspicuous halt in her
communications with Debbie, Dan, and Damen, as evidenced in the AT&T records.
On December 17th, 2023, I was served an eviction notice by Morgan's grandmother—a
notice that cited a divorce and a protective order not yet filed, revealing a preconceived
strategy to undermine my paternal rights and disrupt our daughters' stability,
particularly before the Christmas season.
The subsequent protective order filed on December 22nd, 2023, and the divorce
petition,

STATEMENT  
paint a unilateral narrative of events. Throughout this ordeal, Morgan has actively
excluded me from our daughters' lives and neglected to pursue employment or engage
in any dialogue regarding their future.
Conversely, I have remained steadfast in my parental duties, inviting Morgan to
participate in our daughters' lives, only to be rebuffed at every turn. Her behavior and
legal actions, which starkly contradict her claims of fear, suggest an attempt to evade
accountability rather than protect herself from any purported threat.
The chain of events illustrates a concerted effort by Morgan and her family to extricate
me from our home, leveraging unfounded legal allegations and an eviction suit without
considering the facts or the impact on our daughters.
It is my firm belief that Morgan's actions are self-serving, aimed at avoiding
responsibility for her actions rather than safeguarding our children. Hence, I implore
this court to recognize the inconsistencies in Morgan's claims and to view subsequent
allegations with a discerning eye, considering their strategic nature.
In conclusion, I respectfully request the court to deny the protective order and impose
sanctions on Dan Branthoover for his role in the marital discord that has ensued since
the announcement. It is essential for our daughters' stability and well-being that the full
truth of this matter be brought to light and considered in these proceedings.
