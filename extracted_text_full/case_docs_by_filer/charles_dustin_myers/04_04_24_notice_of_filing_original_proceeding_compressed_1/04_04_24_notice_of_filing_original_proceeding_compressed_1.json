Notably,  \n a family member, has played an active and concerning role in the process  \u2013 claiming to be \nher legal representative yet possessing no license to practice law in the state of Texas.  \n \n1.  and  Influence:  \nI possess extensive text and call logs that unequivocally demonstrate the Plaintiff's prioritization \nof  and  over our family obligations and commitments. These interactions, which \nhave been meticulously logged and analyzed, reveal a consistent pattern where the Plaintiff has \nchosen to allocate a significant amount of her time an d attention to these individuals, even \namidst our divorce proceedings.  It wasn\u2019 t until the dis covery and subsequent discussion of these \ninteractions that lead to the situation escalating. It is my fir m belief that the protective order was \nfiled in an att empt to escape responsibility  rather than to seek protection, as we have been co -\nhabiting th roughout this process, and joint conservatorship was requested on the original \ndivorce petition . \n2.  Branthoover's Role:  \n Branthoover's involvement has escalated beyond mere influence to active participation in \nthe legal aspects of our divorce. He has notably assisted the Plaintiff in preparing and filing \ndivorce papers.  \nCritically, under  advice, the Plaintiff withdrew $1,600 from our joint bank account without \nmy authorization. This unauthorized transaction led to a dire financial situation, with a deficit of \n$800 in our account, resulting in bounced bills and consi derable strain on my business \noperations.  \nThis act of financial maneuvering, advised and facilitated by  not only infringed upon our \nmutual financial responsibilities but also breached the trust inherent in our joint financial \nmanagement. It underscores the extent of third -party involvement in  our personal and legal \naffairs.  \n \n3. Communication Breakdown:  \nThroughout these developments, the Plaintiff has consistently failed to communicate with me \nabout these significant third -party influences and their implications on our divorce and family \ndynamics. This lack of communication has been a major contributing f actor to the \nmisunderstandings and the subsequent escalation of conflict between us.  \nThe involvement of these third parties, particularly the actions taken by   have \nnot only influenced the Plaintiff\u2019s decisions but also actively interfered with our joint financial \nintegrity and the legal process. This has added layers of co mplexity to an already challenging \nsituation and has necessitated the presentation of this comprehensive account in the interest of \ntransparency and fairness in these proceedings.  \nAPPENDIX 63",

      "text": "4. Deterioration of Parental Responsibility\nSince the announcement of our divorce on December 1st, 2023, there has been a noticeable and\nconcerning shift in  parenting responsibilities and her involvement in our children\u2019s\nlives. Prior to this date,  was an engaged and active parent. H owever, since the\nannouncement, her day -to-day interactions with  and  have noticeably\ndeteriorated. This change is not only alarming but also detrimental to the well -being and\nemotional stability of our children.\n has increasingly prioritized her personal interests, specifically her interactions with\nfriends,  and  over her responsibilities as a mother. It has been observed and\ndocumented that she spends an excessive amount of time, estimated to be up to 24 hours per\nweek, visiting these friends. This extensive time spent away from home has not only reduc ed her\nphysical presence in our children's lives but also impacted her emotional availability to them.\nMore concerning is the complete lack of effort on  part to communicate effectively\nabout the children\u2019s needs, their daily routines, and their emotional well -being since the divorce\nannouncement. This breakdown in communication is critical, as co -parenting effectively is\nparamount for the children's adjustment to the changes in our family structure. The inability or\nunwillingness to engage in meaningful dialogue regarding our children\u2019s care is not in their best\ninterest and is counterproductive to their needs during this challenging time.\n5.Contradicting  and False Statements\nThroughout  the ongoing divorce proceedings, there have been several instances of contradictory\nand demonstrably false statements made by  which have significantly complicated and\ndistorted the case. A critical point of contention is  claim regarding her inability to pay,\nwhich is incongruent with the financial facts presented. Additi onally, her request for the waiver\nof the standard 60 -day waiting period for divorce, citing an alleged order that found I had\ncommitted family violence, is entirely baseless and untrue.\nThere is no evidence or record to substantiate claims of family violence in our marriage. In fact,\nthis assertion directly contradicts my clean record and consistent history of being a caring and\nnon-violent partner and father. The accusation appears to be  a strategic move to gain an unfair\nadvantage in the divorce proceedings.\nFurthermore,  actions in filing a protective order, followed by the initiation of an\neviction process, appear to be coordinated attempts to remove me from our family home.\nNotably, the eviction notice cited the protective order as a reason, even though  the protective\norder had not been filed at the time of the eviction notice. This sequence of events points\ntowards a premeditated strategy to unfairly influence the custody and property aspects of our\ndivorce.\nGiven these concerning developments, it is imperative  that this counter petition replace the\noriginal .

Throughout this ordeal,  has actively\nexcluded me from our daughters' lives and neglected to pursue employment or engage\nin any dialogue regarding their future.\nConversely, I have remained steadfast in my parental duties, inviting  to\nparticipate in our daughters' lives, only to be rebuffed at every turn. Her behavior and\nlegal actions, which starkly contradict her claims of fear, suggest an attempt to evade\naccountability rather than protect herself from any purported threat.\nThe chain of events illustrates a concerted effort by  and her family to extricate\nme from our home, leveraging unfounded legal allegations and an eviction suit without\nconsidering the facts or the impact on our daughters.\nIt is my firm belief that  actions are self-serving, aimed at avoiding\nresponsibility for her actions rather than safeguarding our children. Hence, I implore\nthis court to recognize the inconsistencies in  claims and to view subsequent\nallegations with a discerning eye, considering their strategic nature.\nIn conclusion, I respectfully request the court to deny the protective order and impose\nsanctions on   for his role in the marital discord that has ensued since\nthe announcement. It is essential for our daughters' stability and well-being that the full\ntruth of this matter be brought to light and considered in these proceedings.\nAPPENDIX 71",

My lawyer presented the sole option of a \ntemporary return to the family home for 30 days with expanded visitation rights, coupled \nwith a child support obligation  starting in April. This outcome, which diverged significantly \nfrom the case's core issues, compelled me to reconsider my legal representation. \nConsequently, I decided to terminate my attorney's services and embarked on drafting this \nmotion myself, aiming to bring the court's  attention back to the pivotal elements of the case \nthat had thus far been neglected  while able to legally reside in my home . \nCONCLUSION AND PRAYER  \nIn conclusion, this motion has laid bare the stark realities and procedural aberrations that have \nmarred the essence of justice and due process in the matter of Cause No. 322 -744263 -23. \nThrough the course of these proceedings, it has become abundantly clea r that the actions taken \nby the Petitioner,   , have not only disregarded the welfare and best \ninterests of our children but have also illuminated her unfitness as a parent. Her actions speak \nto a pattern of deceit, manipulation, and an unsettling willingness to leverage the judicial \nsystem for personal vendettas, all at the expense of the emotional and psychological well -being \nof our children.  \nThe court, in its decisions, inadvertently facilitated this troubling trajectory by removing me, \n  , from the lives of our children based on unsubstantiated claims and \nwithout due consideration of my role as a devoted and stable parent. T his oversight has not \nonly disrupted the lives of our children but has also significantly impaired my ability to provide \nfor them, casting a long shadow over their future stability and welfare.  \nMoreover, the conduct of my Counsel  involved has further compounded these issues, \ndemonstrating a distressing disregard for the intricate dynamics and facts of this case. This has \nculminated in a situation where the paramount importance of the children's best interests and \nthe fundamental p rinciples of fairness and justice have been overshadowed by procedural \nmissteps and a lack of thorough investigation into the Petitioner's fitness as a parent.  \n-7-\nAPPENDIX 97",

The subsequent \ndismissal of the Protective Order suit not only vindicates the Respondent but also \ninvalidates the current custody orders, revealing that the initial award of custody was  \ngrounded solely in unsubstantiated claims of family violence. \u00b3 \n \nBACKGROUND  \nThe documents on record  filed by the Respondent , by virtue of their acceptance , \ninherently meet the threshold for self -authentication, thereby bolstering the legal \nfoundation for the requested partial Summary Judgment. Detailed herewith are the \nenumerated  facts underpinning this motion:  \n1. On December 14th, 2023, the Petitioner sought an EX -PARTE Order of \nProtection from the Court, which was judiciously denied, affirming the \nabsence of immediate threat or harm that warranted such an extraordinary \nmeasure. Undeterred by this judicial determin ation, the Petitioner proceeded \nto file for divorce on December 18th, 2023, misleadingly alleging the existence \nof an active Order of Protection against the Respondent. This deliberate \nmisrepresentation constitutes not merely an attempt to skew the legal p rocess \nin the Petitioner\u2019s favor but represents a flagrant abuse of the judicial system \ndesigned to secure an undue advantage in the divorce proceedings, which ha s \nultimately been successful.  \n \n2. On December 22nd, 2023, the Petitioner initiated a subsequent application for \na Protective Order, forming the cornerstone of litigation since the initial \nhearing on January 16th, 2024.  \n \n3. On January 16th, 2024, the Court  rendered Temporary Orders which required \nthe Respondent to vacate his family home and  give up custody of his children \non the presumption of family violence. The Court\u2019s decision did not meet the \nstatutory requirements of the Texas Family Code, Sec. 6.502. \u2074 \n \n\u00b3 The non-suit of the protective order entitles the Respondent to this Partial Summary Judgement as a \nmatter of law, as there is now no genuine dispute over the baselessness of the allegations made against \nhim which are the foundation of the current temporary orders in place.  \n\u2074 Sec. 6.502 mandates that a Court may make such a decision while a suit for dissolution of a marriage is \npending and on the motion of a party or on the court's own motion after notice and hearing . No hearing \ntook place, and no reasonable notice was given prior to the decision rendered on January 16th, 2024.   \n-2- \nCopy from re:SearchTX\nAPPENDIX 103",

On January 22nd, 2024, before the start of the reset hearing, the Petitioner   \nacquired legal counsel at the last minute, delaying the case further until the \nreset date of February 1st, 2024 . \n \n5. On February 1st, 2024, both parties entered into an agreement which allowed \nthe respondent back into the home on a temporary basis, yet still awarded the \nPetitioner with full custody of the children.  The Respondent was given 30 days \nper the agreement to remain in the home. Despite having the ability to stay \nnext door, and after dropping the Protective Suit that initiated and are the \nfoundation for this agreement , the Petitioner chose to stay with her friend 9 \nmiles away and remove the children from their stable environment . \n \n6. On February 5th, 2024, the Respondent discharged his Legal Counsel for failure \nto address any of the issues  mentioned herewith, and for failure to diligently \nrepresent the Respondent, as no genuine effort was made to make the court \naware of these errors.  The Protective Order suit was non -suited on this day, \ninvalidating the current agreement, and requiring by law that the Court reset \nthe case back to the status quo ante until a fair discovery process can be \nconducted on relevant matters to the divorce proceeding, and restoring order \nback into the lives of the Respondent and his Children.  \n \n7. The Petitioner's decision to reside outside the family home, despite alternatives \nthat would minimize disruption during this transitional period, is a deliberate \nchoice. This choice, made independently, should not facilitate the continuation \nof unfounded c laims that have since been dismissed. Such actions have unduly \ninfluenced the living arrangements and well -being of the children at the heart \nof this case . \n \n8. The Respondent explicitly refrains from pursuing any sanctions or penalties \nagainst the Petitioner, emphasizing instead a heartfelt plea for a reasonable \ntransition period. This adjustment period is advocated as crucial for \nsafeguarding the welfare of his children, himself, and the Petitioner, ensuring \ntheir collective long -term well -being. Furthermore, the Respondent \nunderscores that the prevailing custody determinations were unjustly \npredicated on unsubstantiated allegations of family violence \u2014a point \nunderscored by the unequivocal dismissal of the Protective Order, which \nconfirms the absence of any contested material facts . \n-3- \nCopy from re:SearchTX\nAPPENDIX 104",

      "text": "LEGAL BASIS  \nThe legal foundation for this Partial Summary Judgment is firmly rooted in the principles \nand mandates of the law, notably where the current temporary orders are predicated on \nunsubstantiated claims of family violence, for which no concrete evidence has been \npresented. This lack of evidence fundamentally challenges the integrity and validity of \nthe orders affectin g the lives and welfare of the children involved. The necessity for the \ncourt to vacate these orders and revert to the status quo ante is underscored by the \nfollowing critical legal argument s: \n1 . Misalignment with Texas Family Code Sec. 105.001:   \n \n1.1 The orders issued on January 16th, 2024, and continued on January \n22nd, 2024, starkly conflict with Texas Family Code Sec. 105.001, which \nunequivocally necessitates notice and a hearing prior to the issuance of \nsuch orders. This statute ensures that partie s are given a fair opportunity to \nbe heard, a fundamental aspect of due process, which was conspicuously \nabsent in this case.  \n \n2. Contravention of Texas Family Code Sec. 105.005:  \n2.1 The initial rendering of temporary orders on January 16th, 2024, did \nnot adhere to Texas Family Code Sec. 105.005 , requiring that court's \nfindings be grounded in a preponderance of the evidence  before making \nany child custody determination affecting the parent -child relationship .  \n \n2.2 The absence of evidence from the Petitioner, juxtaposed with the \ndisregard for the Respondent's timely submissions, underscores a \nsignificant deviation from this legal requirement.  \n \n3. Violation of Texas Family Code Sec. 153.002:   \n \n3.1 The proceedings failed to prioritize \"The best interest of the child,\" as \nmandated by Texas Family Code Sec. 153.002. This principle, deemed \nparamount in determining issues of conservatorship, possession, and \naccess, was overlooked.  \n \n3.2 The Respondent's work -from-home situation and the need for a  \n-4- \nCopy from re:SearchTX\nAPPENDIX 105",

Equal Opportunity and Fair Hearing (Sec. 152.205 & Sec. 105.003):  \n4.1 The Texas Family Code Sec. 152.205  and Sec. 105.003  enshrine the \nnecessity for equitable procedural rights, mandating that all parties are \ngranted a fair opportunity for notification and a meaningful hearing. The \nRespondent \u2019s ability to engage fully in the hearing process and to present a \ncomprehensive defense was significantly impeded, a deviation from the \ndue process envisaged by these statutes. Consequently, the temporary \norders issued lack the foundational fairness that i s central to the justice \nsystem and contravene the legal safeguards intended to ensure balanced \nparticipation by all parties in family law proceedings.  \n \n5. Managing Conservatorship Considerations (Sec. 153.005 & Sec. 153.007):  \n5.1 In deliberations of conservatorship, Texas Family Code Sec. 153.005 \nobligates the court to deliberate thoroughly on the child \u2019s best interest, \nincluding the living circumstances and stability provided by the parents. \nAdditionally, Sec. 153.007  advocates for the establishment of a mutually \nagreed parenting plan, prioritizing the child \u2019s welfare and the continuity of \ntheir established routine. The current  custodial provisions do not \ncorrespond with a collaboratively designed parenting plan that satisfies \nthese essential criteria. Given the disproven allegations of family violence \nand the unnecessary protective measures imposed during this period of \nchange, it is imperative for the Court to rescind these provisional measures. \nThe immediate restoration of the status quo ante is crucial to uphold the \nchildren \u2019s best interest, allowing for a planned and considerate period of \nadjustment that acknowledges the absence of any immediate risk or harm \nto their well -being  and without disruption to the Respondent\u2019s business \noperations at -home.  \n \n6. Rules of Dispositions for Family Law Cases \u2013 (Tarrant County Rules):  \n6.1 The provisions under Rule 4.02: Trial Procedures of the Tarrant Family \nRules , specifically Part 4  concerning the disposition of family law cases, \nhave been notably contravened in the ongoing proceedings of the.

Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367 (Tex. 1976) . This negligence is \nespecially apparent in the Court's oversight of the framework's focus on \nthe supreme significan ce of the children\u2019s emotional and physical well -\nbeing, both currently and in the future.  \n2.The decision in Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367 (Tex. 1976) ,\nemphasizes the importance of conducting a comprehensive analysis that \nconsiders  an extensive range of considerations \u2014including the children's \nemotional and physical needs, potential risks to their safety, and the \ncaregiving capabilities of the parties seeking custody \u2014to determine the \nchild's best interest. The hasty and one -sided dec ision to disturb the \nchildren's stable living conditions and disconnect their relationship with \ntheir father, without diligently applying these factors, directly violates the \nchildren's welfare and best interests.  \n4.It is essential to highlight that the Court\u2019s neglect in evaluating the\nprofound implications on the children\u2019s emotional well -being, by placing \nthem in a setting where their relational ties with their father are not only \nunencouraged but actively hindered, flagrantly contravenes established \nCopy from re:SearchTX\nAPPENDIX 158",

A thorough \nexamination of each parent's plan would unequivocally reveal that the \nmother \u2019s intent is to reduce the father to a child support payment , \nundermining his ability to adequately fulfill his parental responsibilities \nand directly contradicting the children\u2019s best interests.  \n6.Moreover, the oversight of the fourth Holley  factor, concerning the\nfather\u2019s parenting abilities, especially his demonstrated proficiency in \nharmonizing his professional and familial obligations in a manner that \nadvantages the financial and emotional well -being of his daughters, is \nindicative of a p rofound lapse in judicial discretion.

The case underscores \nthe critical role of evaluating a parent's ability to understand and meet \ntheir child's developmental need s without undue state interference.  \n9.Moreover, Troxel  elucidates the constitutional boundary that safeguards a\nparent's prerogative to foster their child's welfare, fundamentally aligning \nwith the Holley  framework's aim to prioritize the child's emotional and \nphysical well -being in the shadow of parental autonomy. The Supreme \nCourt\u2019s insistence on a presumption favoring the parent's decision -making \nauthority serves as a crucial counterbalance to potential  overreach, \nensuring that interventions into family matters are predicated on \ndemonstrable evidence of a significant threat to the child's best interests  \nrather than fr ivolous claims of family violence.  \nIII.Ineffective Representation\n10.

Specifically, \nthe Court opined : \n\"[There is] no subjective good faith excuse for attorney negligence. A lawyer in \nTexas is held to [a] standard of care which would be exercised by a reasonably \nprudent attorney\" (774 S.W.2d at 665).  \nThis standard provides a critical framework for assessing the actions of \nlegal professionals and emphasizes the objective measure of care expected \nin legal representation, irrespective of the attorney's subjective belief in \ntheir good faith efforts.  \n12. Moreover, the Cosgrove  decision importantly clarifies that the evaluation\nof an attorney's conduct must be based on the information available at \nthe time of the alleged act of negligence, further specifying : \n\"If an attorney makes a decision which a reasonably prudent attorney could make \nin the [same or similar] circumstance, it is not an act of negligence even if the \nresult is undesirable\" (774 S.W.2d at 665) .\" (774 S.W.2d at 665).\nCopy from re:SearchTX\nAPPENDIX 161",

The series of events delineated \u2014\nranging from initial reluctance to accept the case to procedural \ndiscrepancies and strategic maneuverings \u2014highlight a profound need for \nreflect ion on the core principles governing legal practice.  \n15.

This \nconduct, marked by a last -minute draft  filled with errors and deviations \nfrom agreed terms , starkly contravenes the fiduciary duty owed to clients. \nSuch actions erode the foundational trust in legal practitioners and the \nintegrity of legal agreements, as exemplified in Smith v.

The situation involving the mother \u2019s counsel, characterized by her\nunilateral focus on crafting agreed temporary orders that superficially \nprovided the respondent with his sought relief, underscores a grave \nconcern within the legal framework.

This failure was \nfurther exacerbated by the last -minute drafting of the agreement, which \nwas not only replete with errors but also deviated significantly from the \noriginally agreed terms.

Non-compliance with Temporary Order Requirements\n27. The Respondent maintains that the court's issuance of temporary orders\nviolated Texas Family Code \u00a7 105.001(b).

In light of the overwhelming evidence , lack of response to such evidence,\nand the serious misjudgments identified throughout these proceedings, \nthe only just and equitable resolution is the immediate restoration of the \nRespondent's constitutional and parental rights. The egregious violations \nof due process and the disregard for  the fundamental principles of justice \nnecessitate not only the reevaluation of custody and access decisions but \nalso the implementation of protective measures to safeguard the well -\nbeing of the children involved.  \n32. The imposition of a restraining order against the Petitioner and her family\nmembers,  particularly  Wilson and , until \nsuch a time as the Respondent can secure alternative residency for \nhimself and the children, is both a prudent and necessary step. This \nmeasure is not punitive in nature but truly protective, aiming to ensure \nthe safety and emotional stability of the children during this tumultuous \nperiod. It acknowledges the necessity of shielding the children from \nfurther exposure to conflict and manipulation, allowing them the \nopportunity to rebu ild their lives in a nurturing and secure environment.  \n33.
