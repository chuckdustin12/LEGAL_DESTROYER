 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS  
 
TO THE HONORABLE JUSTICES OF THE SECOND COURT OF APPEALS:  
Relator C.D.M., (“Father”) submits this Petition for Writ of 
Mandamus, and as grounds, therefore, would show as follows:  
I. 
STATEMENT OF FACTS  
A. Between December 14th, 2023, and December 27th, 2023, the Mother 
filed for two protective orders, a divorce, and influenced an 
eviction suit –  each of them claiming family  violence.  
On December 14th, 2023, Mother requested an emergency ex -parte 
order of protection from DJ Respondent.1 
On December 17th, 2023, the Mother’s grandmother served the 
Realtor with an eviction notice citing a yet to be filed divorce 
petition and protective order. On December 18th, 2024, the Mother 
wrote “VOID” on the notice in black ink and physically tore it in 
half.App 1-2.  
 
1 This reference can be found in the Original Petition for Divorce, page 7 
under 9B. See App. 9.

12 
 On December 18th, 2023, The Mother filed for divorce waiving 
the 60-day waiting period claiming that an active order of 
protection was active against the Father.App . 11.  
On December 22nd, 2023, the Mother filed for a Protective 
Order against the Father despite getting denied an emergency 
protective order on December 14th, 2024.App.  15-21.  
On December 27th, 2023, The  ex-parte protective order was 
filed with the Court against the Father, indicating a denial based 
on the “ Xs” marked over the pages .App.22-25.  
On December 28th, 2023, the Father was served with the 
Eviction suit initiated by the Mother’s grandparents.App . 26. A 
third ex- parte protective order was filed with the Court  also 
containing “Xs” marked across the pages .App. 27-30 . 
 
B. Between January 2nd, 2024, and the initial Show Cause hearing 
scheduled for January 16th, 2024, the Father prepared his defense 
to address the baseless allegations  of family violence made 
against him.2 
 
2 At the time of this filing, not one document has been filed corroborating 
the claims made by the Mother or her Counsel regarding family violence.

13 
 On January 2nd, 2024, Father filed his answer to the 
protective order.App. 31-35 . The answer was accompanied by the 
Father’s criminal record from the Texas Department of Public 
Safety, marked as EXHIBIT B.App. 36-37.  
On January 3rd, 2024, Father filed a motion to consolidate for 
judicial efficiency.App. 38 -41. Father’s motion to consolidate was 
accompanied by his Background Report for Case Consolidation.App. 42-43. 
On January 8
th, 2024, the Father filed a motion for 
continuance.App . 44-46. The Father’s motion for continuance was 
filed with a brief attached , explaining that he had been focusing 
on the Children’s holidays and school vacation while simultaneously battling concurrent litigation by the Mother and 
landlords , and was requesting the continuance to allow more time 
to prepare given these circumstances.App. 47 -49. 
 
C. On January 16
th, 2024, t he Father was ordered to vacate the 
family home and place of business  on four hours’ notice, and full 
custody was awarded to the Mother.  
On January 16th, 2024, the Father was ordered to vacate his 
home without due process, and despite the Father’s motion for

14 
 continuance being granted alongside his motion for consolidation, 
this decision was made without any witnesses being called and 
before the Father could obtain legal Counsel and the hearing was 
re-scheduled for January 22nd, 2024.App. 50- 51.  
On the evening of January 16th, 2024, Father filed his 
Counterpetition for Divorce App. 52-61, accompanied by a 
comprehensive statement of context to provide insights into the 
case, detailing the situation, and outline the evidence the Father 
would present at the reset hearing on January 22nd, 2024.App. 62-
67. Father also filed an unsworn declaration to shed light on the conspiratorial nature of the collective actions taken against him 
by the Mother and her family.App. 68 -71. 
 
D. After being removed from his home, the Father attended the 
eviction hearing and prevailed on January 17
th, 2024. 
On January 17th, 2024, less than 24 hours after being ordered 
to vacate the residence, the Father attended the eviction hearing 
at Justice of the Peace 1 in Fort Worth, Texas, where he prevailed 
for lack of jurisdiction.App. 72.

15 
 On January 19th, 2024, Father retained Counsel.  
On January 19th, 2024, Father retained Counsel to advocate on 
his Children’s behalf and represent his interests. SApp. 2.  
 
E. Mother’s failure to acquire counsel in time for the reset 
hearing resulted in further delays on January 22nd, 2024, due to AJ 
Respondent granting her continuance . 
On January 22nd, 2024, after Father acquired  Counsel and 
attending the reset hearing, Mother failed to acquire 
representation until minutes before the hearing started to which a 
continuance was requested and subsequently granted , causing 
further delays in the proceedings, and prompting yet another reset 
for February 1st, 2024.App.  73-74. 
 
F. At the next hearing on February 1st, 2024, Father’s Counsel 
drafted an Associate Judge’s Agreed Report, and part of this 
agreement , Mother dropped the protective order suit against the 
Father while granting him temporary relief until March 1st.  
On February 1st, 2024, the hearing was usurped by Father’s 
Counsel and was suddenly focused on the drafting of an Associate

16 
 Judge’s ReportApp. 75 -80 with the addition of temporary child 
support to be paid by the FatherApp. 76 rather than holding a 
hearing to discuss the issues that were directly communicated via 
email leading up to the hearing.SApp 3-7. The last page of the orders had specific procedural requirements that were part of the 
order that stated:  
“A typed written Order conforming to this Report will follow 
within 20 days from the date this Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be prepared by Dan Bacalis
3. 
Each attorney should approve the Order. The parties do not need to approve the Order. The attorney reviewing the 
proposed Order shall have five (5) days to do so. There are 
no ten (10) day letters. If an agreement is not reached, a Motion to Sign shall be filed and set within thirty (30) days from the signing of this Report.“ App. 79.  
 
The agreement allowed the Father back into the family home so 
he could work and regain his active role in his Children’s lives 
until March 1
st App. 77 while simultaneously removing the Children 
from their own home until the same date and dropping the 
protective order suit initiated by the Mother which had been the 
basis for every decision leading up to this point in the case. App. 
77. 
 
3 Dan Bacalis was terminated on February 5th, 2024, by the Father, making these 
procedural stipulations outlined in the order arguably impossible to satisfy without 
modification.

17 
  
G. Father terminated the services of his legal Counsel on February 
5th, 2024. 
On February 5th, 2024, Father’s Counsel was terminated due to 
ineffective representation, and a notice was promptly filed with 
the Court.App. 81-83. SApp. 8.  
On February 6th, 2024, an agreed motion for withdrawal of 
attorney was signed by the Father and his Counsel and filed with 
the Court.App. 84-87.  
 
 
H. On February 9th, 2024, Father filed his emergency motion to 
reconsider / vacate temporary orders. 
The Father filed his motion to reconsider evidence and vacate 
temporary orders on February 9th, 2024,App. 88-90, accompanied by a 
detailed brief which aimed to challenge the overall foundation of 
the case and bring to light the procedural missteps and re-focus 
the case on the Children’s best interests.App. 91- 98. 
 
I. The Order for Withdrawal of Attorney was rendered and served to 
all parties on February 12th, 2024. 
On February 12th, 2024, the Order for Withdrawal of Attorney 
was filed with the Clerk containing AJ Respondent’s signature

18 
 dated February 8th, 2024, which stated that the Court found  no 
pending settings or deadlines within the case.App. 99-10 1. 
 
J. On February 13th, 2024, Father communicated with Mother’s 
Counsel regarding the scheduling of the reconsideration motion.  
 On February 13th, 2024, Father reached out via email to 
Mother’s counsel regarding the scheduling of the reconsideration 
motion, where she claimed that she would have availability nearly 
a month later, and also claimed that she would be filing a counter-motion.
4SApp 15.  
 
K. The Father moved for a Partial Summary Judgement on February 22
nd, 2024. 
On February 22nd, 2024, Father filed a Motion for Partial 
Summary Judgement after no counter- motion was filed by Mother’s 
Counsel with an accompanying brief to argue that the evidence and 
procedural history presented in the case clearly favor his 
position, demonstrating that the actions taken against him were 
not supported by the substantive facts of the case or in the best interest of the children, eliminating the need for a hearing regarding the reconsideration motion.App. 102-111.  The Father’s 
proposed parenting plan was attached to the motion as EXHIBIT 
D.App. 112-115.  
 
 
4 This counter motion was never filed.

19 
 L. On February 27th, a Notice of Hearing was served regarding 
Father’s Reconsideration Motion.  
On February 27th, a Notice of Hearing was served on all 
Parties scheduled for March 14th, 2024, on Father’s reconsideration 
Motion.App. 116 -117.  
 
M. Father filed an Unsworn Declaration with the Court on March 3rd, 
2024.  
On March 3rd, 2024, Father filed a Notice and unsworn 
declaration with the Court explaining he would be unable to vacate 
the home by March 1st, as the Mother’s employment had changed, and 
that it would not be in the Children’s best interest.App.118-121.  
 
N. Father and Mother attended the  reconsideration hearing on March 
14th, 2024. 
On March 14th, 2024, Minutes before the hearing, Mother’s 
Counsel hands the Father the agreed orders reduced to writing in 
the Courtroom, which differed from the original agreed orders 
signed on February 1st, 2024, such as the Father requiring to 
vacate the home by March 20th, rather than March 1st, and the Mother 
and Children being allowed to return on the 30th, not the 1st, which 
left a 10 -day gap where neither party would be occupying the 
residence .SApp. 16. Father’s reconsideration motion was denied  on 
March 14th, 2024.App. 122.

20 
  
O. Father filed a Notice of Judicial Review With the Court on 
March 26th, 2024. 
On March 26th, 2024, Father filed his Second Amended Notice of 
Judicial Review App. 123-171  that contains familial background 
history.App.132  as well as employment history and family 
dynamics. App. 133-140 . This review also contains a statement of 
facts with several linked documents embedded within the filing  
that reiterate many facts brought forth within this mandamus petition. App.141-150. Most critically, the Respondent’s Parental 
Index within the document highlights the Father’s pivotal role in 
the Children’s lives throughout these proceedings. App.151-154. 
SApp. 17- 55.  
This document also contains sworn statements from the 
Father’s business clients that was offered at the hearing on March 14
th, 2024, corroborating the Father’s active involvement in the 
Children’s lives, work ethic, and history working out of the 
family residence.App. 172-187.

21 
 P. On March 26th, 2024, the Agreed Associate Judge’s Report was 
reduced to writing and became Temporary Orders, and was served on 
the parties.  
On March 26th, 2024, the judgement and denial of Father’ s 
reconsideration motion was filed with the Clerk and served on the 
parties, rendering the current temporary ordersApp. 188- 226 
effective until the signing of the final decree of divorce.App  
224.  
II. 
SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT 
DJ Respondent abused his discretion when naming the Mother 
primary managing conservator of the children during a protective 
order hearing before any witnesses could be called or any evidence 
could be presented by the Father, disregarding TEX FAM. CODE 
105.001(b ) which clearly states, “an order may not be rendered 
under Subsection (a)(1), (2), or (5) except after notice and a 
hearing.”. In light of these facts, by DJ Respondent naming the 
Mother primary managing conservator  of the Children, which falls 
under TEX. FAM CODE 105.001(a)(1), he clearly abused his 
discretion.

22 
 AJ Respondent abused his discretion on January 22nd, 2024, 
when DJ Respondent’s orders expired, and AJ Respondent rendered 
temporary orders for the temporary conservatorship of the Children 
and excluded the Father from the residence  without a hearing due 
to the Mother’s inability to hire counsel until just minutes prior 
to the reset hearing.  “[A]n order may not be rendered under 
Subsection (a)(1), (2), or (5) except after notice and a 
hearing.”. TEX FAM. CODE 105.001(b)  
AJ Respondent also clearly abused his discretion when signing 
the Agreed Associate Judge’s Report  on February 1st, 2024, drafted 
by Father’s attorney for “the temporary conservatorship of the 
children”  FAM CODE §  105.001(a)(1) , and “for the temporary 
support of the children”  TEX. FAM CODE §  105.001(a)(2)  when such 
an order “may not be rendered ...before notice and hearing.” TEX 
FAM. CODE 105.001(b).  Given the fact that no hearing had taken 
place up to this point in the case, and given the temporary relief 
sought was a part of the agreement, the Father, who had been 
unable to work since January 16th, 2024, signed the agreement as 
there was no better alternative at the time, where he then 
immediately terminated his Counsel and challenged the orders’ 
foundational basis on March 14th, which was denied, leaving no

23 
 remedy of relief for the Realtor other than this petition for writ 
of mandamus.  
Furthermore, AJ Respondent abused his discretion when 
entering the temporary orders after notice and hearing despite 
them failing to meet the procedural requirements ordered  in the 
Agreed Associate Judge’s Report that he previously signed. The 
Report was reduced to writing by Mother’s Counsel just minutes 
before the reconsideration hearing on March 14th, 2024, and were 
filed as Temporary Orders with the Clerk of the court on March 
26th, 2024. The only witness called in this case was the Mother 
during the reconsideration hearing for the purpose of obtaining 
legal fees. The documents filed within this case will show that 
both Respondent’s determinations are made on no factual basis and 
the Children’s best interests have been ignored outright , and 
hinge on a misapplication of law and without supporting evidence.  
III. 
ARGUMENT  
 
A. AVAILABILITY OF MANDAMUS RELIEF  
Mandamus is an appropriate remedy for a parent to attack the 
issuance of temporary orders in a custody proceeding, since such

24 
 orders are not subject to interlocutory appeal.  Dancy v. 
Daggett, 815 S.W.2d 548, 549 (Tex. 1991) (per curiam).   
A writ of mandamus is the correct recourse when the trial 
court exhibits an abuse of discretion and there is no other 
adequate legal remedy available, such as an appeal. In re 
Prudential Insurance Company of America, 148 S.W.3d 124, 135 -36 
(Tex. 2004)   
Furthermore, conservatorship determinations made after a bench 
trial are "subject to review only for abuse of discretion and may 
be reversed only if the decision is arbitrary and unreasonable." 
In re J.A.J., 243 S.W.3d 611, 616 (Tex. 2007)  quoting Gillespie 
v. Gillespie, 644 S.W.2d 449, 451(Tex.1982)  
B. Issue No. 1  
After denying an emergency protective order on December 14th, 
2023, DJ Respondent erred in rendering temporary orders having 
the same effect as an emergency ex- parte order, which affected 
the parent-child relationship and property division without 
notice and hearing and did not consider the Children’s best 
interests  when removing the Realtor from his place of business 
and Children’s lives without any justifiable reason.  
 
The Texas Family Code  provides that “after notice and  
hearing, the court may render an appropriate order, including the  
granting of a temporary injunction for the preservation of the

25 
 property and protection of the parties as deemed necessary and 
equitable .” Id § 6.502(a) . Considering no witnesses were called 
or evidence produced at the initial  appearance on January 16th, 
2024, the necessity of such significant actions were  
unreasonable.  
DJ Respondent abused his discretion by awarding the mother 
temporary  primary conservatorship of the Children and sole 
occupancy of the residenc y before any witnesses were called or 
evidence presented, despite granting a continuance for the 
parties to acquire legal representation and resetting the case 
for January 22nd, 2024 when “[c]ertain orders, such as those 
regarding temporary conservatorship of children, may not be 
rendered without notice and a hearing..." In re S.M., 13 -23-
00371-CV at 11 (Tex. App. Oct 04, 2023).  Furthermore, the hearing 
was scheduled to Show Cause regar ding a protective order, but was 
immediately turned into a SAPCR suit upon the granting of a 
continuance when no first  appearance had been set for the 
divorce. Rule of Civil Procedure 245 provides that the trial 
court "may set contested cases on written request of any party, 
or on the court's own motion, with reasonable notice of not less 
than forty-five days to the parties of a first setting for 
trial, or by agreement of the parties." See Tex.R.Civ.P. 245 .

26 
 “The forty-five -day notice provision of Rule 245 is mandatory. ” 
In re V.J., 02- 22-00233-CV (Tex. App. Aug 10, 2023). By 
consolidating the protective order with the divorce and then 
immediately severing the Father from the Children’s lives and 
property despite an agreed continuance fails to abide by this 
mandatory forty -five day requiremen t. 
1. The initial child custody determinations did not consider 
the children’s best interests . 
On January 16th, 2024, this significant decision was made, 
effectively removing one parent from the Children’s lives, and 
introducing instability without any consideration of the 
Children’s best interests  when “the best interest[s]  of the 
child[ren] shall always be the primary consideration in 
determining conservatorship, possession of, and access to the 
child[ren].” Id. § 153.002. The fact that the Father requires the 
residency for his at- home business, and given that such a 
business would take time to transition to an alternative 
residency, the DJ Respondent erred in not taking these facts into 
consideration when “[s]uits  affecting  the  parent- child  
relationship  are  ‘intensly  fact- driven’  and  require  courts  
to  balance  many  factors.”  Billisits  v.  Billisits,  No.  03-

27 
 21-00358- CV, 2023  WL 2191330,  at  *2  (Tex.  App.— Austin  Feb. 
24,  2023,  no  pet.)  (mem.  op.).  
C. Issue No. 2  
AJ Respondent abused his discretion when rendering temporary 
orders affecting the parent -child relationship without notice 
and hearing, allowing the Mother more time to acquire Counsel while prolonging the Realtor’s unjustified removal  from his home 
and business, and leaving the Children without an involved parent who provides for them out of the home, disregarding their 
best interests and emotional well -being entirely.  
 On January 22nd, DJ Respondent’s orders reset, and when Father 
and Mother made their appearance, the Mother failed to acquire 
legal representation until just minutes before the scheduled 
hearing, which delayed the proceedings until February 1st, 2024. 
This resulted in an Associate Judge’s Report being rendered that 
awarded the mother primary conservatorship of the Children and 
sole use of the residency  once again without any witnesses being 
called, or evidence being presented by the parties, and once 
again overlooking the Children’s best interests when it has been 
determined that "[t]he test for abuse of discretion is whether 
the trial court ruled arbitrarily, unreasonably, without regard 
to guiding legal principles, or without supporting evidence.” 
Bocquet v. Herring, 972 S.W.2d 19, 21 (Tex. 1998) .

28 
 D. Issue No. 3  
Both Respondents abused their discretion by playing their 
respective parts in drafting and then upholding temporary orders 
that have no basis in fact or law and have taken no consideration 
to the Children’s best interests, which resulted in turning the 
only life the Children had ever known on its’ head.   
On February 1st, 2024, the parties attended the second reset 
hearing, where Counsel began negotiations and drafted an Agreed 
Associate Judge’s Report giving father temporary relief back into 
the family home until March 1st, 2024App. 120 , but keeping the 
mother as the primary conservator .App. 118. This outcome  raised 
significant questions about the adequacy of Father’s Counsel's 
advocacy on behalf of the  children, especially considering no 
additional facts were presented by the Mother to justify the 
decision rendered in the challenged Agreed Associate Judge’s 
Report. G iven that temporary relief was given to the Father, he 
signed the agreement and subsequently terminated his legal 
representation on February 5th, 2024 and filed a notice with the 
court regarding the termination of his Counsel for ineffective 
representation.

29 
 1. After terminating his representation, Father filed for a 
motion to reconsider challenging the foundational basis for 
the agreed report signed on February 1st, 2024. 
On February 9th, Father filed an emergency motion to 
reconsider evidence and to vacate temporary orders with an 
attached brief explaining  the issues. A hearing was not set on 
this motion until over a month later on March 14th, 2024, as 
opposing Counsel stated that was her only available timeframe 
despite not filing any response, objections, or conducting any 
due diligence  between  February 9th, 2024, and March 14th, 2024 
as the record will show.  
2. Father’s motion to reconsider evidence and vacate temporary 
orders was denied by AJ Respondent and evidence was not 
allowed to be admitted.  
On March 14th, 2024, AJ Respondent denied Father’s motion 
for reconsideration after only one witness was called (the 
Mother) who testified for the sole purpose of collecting 
attorney’s fees, and while providing no evidence or testimony 
providing any insight into the Children’s well-being or best 
interests . The Father offered several affidavits from his 
business clients corroborating his claims about needing

30 
 residency  to work from home, which were not admitted into 
evidence which would have shown his dedication to his work, 
and Children.  Realtor argues that  no evidence shows that his 
removal from the home was in the best interest of the child, 
and "[b]ecause the evidence does not satisfy the standard set 
out in section 156.006(b), the trial court abused its 
discretion by rendering the temporary order that changed 'the 
designation of the person who has the exclusive right to 
designate the primary residence of the child." In re 
Montemayor, No. 04-16 -00222-CV (Tex. App. Jun 22, 2016).  
3. Father added the refused affidavits to the clerk’s record 
via a notice of judicial review.  
The Father filed these affidavits  in accordance with his 
Second Amended Prepatory Notice for Judicial Review filed on 
March 26, 2024 .App. 123 , which contains familial 
backgroundApp. 132 , family dynamics and employment historyApp. 
133-140, a Statement of Facts,App  141-150.5 and his efforts in 
these matters regarding the zealous advocation for the best 
interests of his Children.App. 155 -157. 
 
5 The links in this document have been redacted to protect the parties and 
minor children.

31 
 4. On March 26th, 2024, AJ Respondent rendered Temporary Orders 
that would remain until the final decree of divorce was 
signed. 
The agreement, executed by all parties and their Counsel on 
February 1st, 2024, outlined specific obligations what were 
not met upon the rendition of these orders. The failure to 
meet the agreement’s requirements was prominently addressed 
during the oral argument on March 14th.6 Despite this, the 
orders, hastily reduced to writing that same day and not 
conforming to the agreed- upon requirements, were not issued 
until March 26th, 2024—significantly later than the 20-days 
stipulated. This resulted in the final orders being issued 
without the necessary signatures from the Father or his 
preceding Counsel  and still failing to be based on any 
pertinent facts related to the Children’s best interests . 
5. The Children’s best interests have been starkly overlooked 
by all parties in the case outside of the Father . 
Had just one of the eight factors  outlined in the long-dated 
case of Holly v. Adams 544 S.W.2d 367 (1976) been applied to 
 
6 No court reporter was available for the hearing, so no transcript was made 
of the oral arguments.

32 
 the decisions made within this case, the trial court would 
have not erroneously severed an active and loving father from 
his Children’s lives and would not have removed the Father 
from his residency that he needs to provide for the Children without notice and hearing on multiple occasions.  
Throughout these proceedings – the clerk’s record will 
clearly show continuous efforts from the Father to advocate 
for his Children’s best interests , and the lack thereof by 
Counsel and both Respondents, entitling the Father to 
immediate relief via mandamus, as his burden  to show an abuse 
of discretion , which is to  “show that the trial court acted in 
an arbitrary or unreasonable manner, or without regard to 
guiding principles of law.” Billisits v. Billisits, No. 03-
21-00358- CV, 2023 WL 2191330 (Tex. App.—Austin Feb. 24, 2023) 
(mem. op.), can be met by simply looking at the face of the 
clerk’s record.  
IV.  
CONCLUSON  
The initial decision by DJ Respondent laid a flawed foundation 
for the case, rushing into custody and property division  without 
any facts, and affecting all later decisions and disregarding the

33 
 Children's best interests. AJ Respondent's actions of 
exacerbating and the drafting of an agreed order by ineffective 
Counsel merely perpetuated these errors, using the F ather's 
pursuit of relief as leverage. This process effectively excluded 
a dedicated parent from his children's lives, only to 
conditionally re- admit him temporarily, while simultaneously 
allowing the Mother to remove them from their own home as her 
primary designation has remained throughout these proceeding s 
simply because she alleged family violence that was intentionally 
frivolous . This cascade of decisions represents a stark abuse of 
judicial discretion and a failure of legal duty, highlighting the 
urgent need for rectification to uphold the integrity of the 
family law system and protect the children's welfare. The 
benefits of the Father’s restoration to the family home and place 
of business, and the restoration to his daughter’s lives 
outweighs the burden put on the Mother if this petition were to 
be granted. The Mother has unjustifiably orchestrated the removal 
of an actively engaged and nurturing parent from the children's 
daily lives. This action, taken without presenting any 
substantiating evidence and despite readily available alternative 
housing options t hat would allow for minimal disruption to the 
children’s routine, amounts to an unwarranted upheaval of their

34 
 well-being. Granting this writ of mandamus would be an act of 
immediate and necessary correction, upholding justice, and the 
paramount principle of the children's best interest, which has 
been so abruptly compromised and disregarded by the Respondents 
and Counsel alike in this case.  
PRAYER 
 
Wherefore premises considered, for all the foregoing reasons 
alleged and briefed herein,  Realtor C.D.M. prays that this court 
grant him mandamus relief and order AJ Respondent to vacate the 
current temporary orders that have no factual backing, thereby 
restoring the status quo to the Children’s lives, the Realtor’s 
business, and restoring the stability the Children  have always 
known while the case is pending or until the Realtor can have a reasonable amount of time to transition from the family home.  
Relator C.D.M. further requests that this court grant him 
such other relief both general and special, at law or in equity, 
to which he may show himself to be justly entitled.  
Respectfully submitted,  
  C.D.M.

Relator notes the absence of a court -reported record for this case, signiﬁcantly 
hindering the ability to provide a verba�m transcript of proceedings crucial to this 
mandamus ac�on. Notably, the only witness called during these proceedings was 
the mothe r, primarily for securing legal fees for the March 14th mo�on for 
reconsidera�on. This unique circumstance, compounded by the lack of a court 
reporter, accentuates the need for the Court's detailed review of the atached appendix. This appendix, containi ng all relevant documents ﬁled in compliance 
with statutory requirements and unopposed to date, forms the core evidence for 
the Court's considera�on. Despite these procedural anomalies, the Relator 
believes the submited documents will suﬃciently suppo rt the Pe��on for Writ of 
Mandamus.

"Health Insurance" means insurance coverage that provides basic health-care services, 
including usual physician services, office visits, hospitalization, and laboratory, X-ray, and 
emergency services, that may be provided through a health maintenance organization or other 
private or public organization, other than medical assistance under chapter 32 of the Texas 
Human Resources Code. 
"Reasonable cost" means the total cost of health insurance coverage for all children for 
which   is responsible under a medical support order that does not exceed 9 
percent of   annual resources, as described by section 154.062(b) of the 
Texas Family Code. 
"Health-care expenses" include, without limitation, medical, surgical, prescription drug, 
mental health-care services, dental, eye care, ophthalmological, and orthodontic charges but do 
not include expenses for travel to and from the provider or for nonprescription medication. 
"Health-care expenses that are not reimbursed by insurance" ("unreimbursed expenses") 
include related copayments and deductibles. 
3. Findings on Availability of Health Insurance -Having considered the cost, 
accessibility, and quality of health insurance coverage available to the parties, the Court finds:

Copy from re:SearchTX

4. Provision of Health-Care Coverage -
As Petitioner's child support,   is ORDERED to obtain Medicaid for 
the children the subject of this suit, and then maintain health insurance for the children as long as 
child support is payable for that child.   is ORDERED -
a. to provide to each conservator of the children the following information no later 
than the thirtieth day after she received Medicaid for the children: 
a.  Social Security number; 
b. Proof that health insurance has been provided for the children; 
c. The following information and documents: 
1. The name of the health insurance carrier; 
11. The number of the policy; 
111. A copy of the policy; 
1v. A schedule of benefits; 
v. A health insurance membership card; 
v1. Claim forms; and 
VII. Any other information necessary to submit a claim; and 
d. To provide each conservator of the children with a copy of any 
renewals or changes to the health insurance coverage of the children 
and any additional information regarding health insurance coverage 
of the children no later than the fifteenth day after  
 receives or is provided with the renewal, change, or 
additional information; 
e. To notify each conservator of the children of any termination or 
Copy from re:SearchTX

lapse of health insurance coverage of the children no later than the 
fifteenth day after the date of the termination or lapse; 
f. After termination or lapse of health insurance coverage, to notify 
each conservator of the children of the availability to  
 of additional health insurance for the children no later than 
the fifteenth day after the date the insurance becomes available; 
g. After termination or lapse of health insurance coverage, to enroll the

  is eligible for dependent health coverage but fails to apply to obtain 
coverage for the children, the insurer shall enroll the children on application of  
 or others authorized by law. 
5. Allocation ofUnreimbursed Expenses -
The conservator who incurs a health-care expense on behalf of a child is ORDERED to 
provide to the other conservator receipts, bills, statements, or explanations of benefits showing 
the uninsured portion of the health-care expenses within thirty days after the incurring 
conservator receives them. The nonincurring conservator is ORDERED to pay the non-incurring 
conservator's percentage of the unreimbursed portion of the health-care expenses either by 
paying the health-care provider directly or by reimbursing the incurring conservator for any 
advance payment exceeding the incurring conservator's percentage of the unreimbursed portion 
of the health-care expenses within thirty days after the nonincurring conservator receives 
receipts, bills, statements, or explanations of benefits showing the unreimbursed portion of the 
Copy from re:SearchTX

health-care expense. 
For the Court to hold the nonincurring conservator in civil or criminal contempt for 
failing to pay the nonincurring conservator's percentage of the unreimbursed portion of a health­
care expense, the incurring conservator must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the 
nonincurring conservator personally received receipts, bills, statements, or explanations of 
benefits reflecting the unreimbursed portion of the health-care expense no later than thirty days 
after the incurring conservator received them. Even if the incurring conservator fails to meet that 
burden of proof, the Court may award the incurring conservator a judgment in the nature of child 
support against the nonincurring conservator in the amount of the unreimbursed portion of the 
heath-care expense the nonincurring conservator was ordered but fail to pay.

CHILDREN, WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER THE EXPENSES WOULD HA VE BEEN 
PAID IF HEALTH INSURANCE OR DENTAL INSURANCE HAD BEEN PROVIDED, AND 
FOR THE COST OF HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS, DENTAL INSURANCE

COUNTER -PETITION FOR DIVORCE AND COMPREHENSIVE STATEMENT OF CONTEXT  
 
IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY , TEXAS  
322ND JUDICIAL DISTRICT  
 
   
Plaintiff,  
 
vs. 
 
   
Defendant.  
 
COUNTER -PETITION FOR DIVORCE AND COMPREHENSIVE STATEMENT OF CONTEXT  
 
TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT:  
 
I,    the Defendant in the above -captioned case, submit this Counter -Petition for 
Divorce and Comprehensive Statement of Context in response to the Original Petition for Divorce filed by 
   the Plaintiff. This documen t addresses the inaccuracies in the Plaintiff's petition, 
provides a detailed account of the situation, and outlines the evidence I am prepared to present to the 
Court.  
 
I. OVERVIEW AND CONTEXT  
 
This divorce is intertwined with two additional legal proceedings - an eviction suit (Case No. JP01 -23-
E00102017) and a protective order (Case No. 322 -744538 -23), both of which are deeply entangled with 
the divorce case (Case No. 322 -744263 -23). 
 
 
 322-744263-23
APPENDIX 62

The significant third -party influence exerted by individuals named   and  as well as 
our landlord – her Grandmother – who lives next door to us - has critically impacted the Plaintiff's 
decisions and actions in our marital matters and the ongoing divorce proceedings. Notably,  
 a family member, has played an active and concerning role in the process  – claiming to be 
her legal representative yet possessing no license to practice law in the state of Texas.  
 
1.  and  Influence:  
I possess extensive text and call logs that unequivocally demonstrate the Plaintiff's prioritization 
of  and  over our family obligations and commitments. These interactions, which 
have been meticulously logged and analyzed, reveal a consistent pattern where the Plaintiff has 
chosen to allocate a significant amount of her time an d attention to these individuals, even 
amidst our divorce proceedings.  It wasn’ t until the dis covery and subsequent discussion of these 
interactions that lead to the situation escalating. It is my fir m belief that the protective order was 
filed in an att empt to escape responsibility  rather than to seek protection, as we have been co -
habiting th roughout this process, and joint conservatorship was requested on the original 
divorce petition . 
2.  Branthoover's Role:  
 Branthoover's involvement has escalated beyond mere influence to active participation in 
the legal aspects of our divorce. He has notably assisted the Plaintiff in preparing and filing 
divorce papers.  
Critically, under  advice, the Plaintiff withdrew $1,600 from our joint bank account without 
my authorization. This unauthorized transaction led to a dire financial situation, with a deficit of 
$800 in our account, resulting in bounced bills and consi derable strain on my business 
operations.  
This act of financial maneuvering, advised and facilitated by  not only infringed upon our 
mutual financial responsibilities but also breached the trust inherent in our joint financial 
management. It underscores the extent of third -party involvement in  our personal and legal 
affairs.  
 
3. Communication Breakdown:  
Throughout these developments, the Plaintiff has consistently failed to communicate with me 
about these significant third -party influences and their implications on our divorce and family 
dynamics. This lack of communication has been a major contributing f actor to the 
misunderstandings and the subsequent escalation of conflict between us.  
The involvement of these third parties, particularly the actions taken by   have 
not only influenced the Plaintiff’s decisions but also actively interfered with our joint financial 
integrity and the legal process. This has added layers of co mplexity to an already challenging 
situation and has necessitated the presentation of this comprehensive account in the interest of 
transparency and fairness in these proceedings.  
APPENDIX 63

4. Deterioration of Parental Responsibility
Since the announcement of our divorce on December 1st, 2023, there has been a noticeable and
concerning shift in  parenting responsibilities and her involvement in our children’s
lives. Prior to this date,  was an engaged and active parent. H owever, since the
announcement, her day -to-day interactions with  and  have noticeably
deteriorated. This change is not only alarming but also detrimental to the well -being and
emotional stability of our children.
 has increasingly prioritized her personal interests, specifically her interactions with
friends,  and  over her responsibilities as a mother. It has been observed and
documented that she spends an excessive amount of time, estimated to be up to 24 hours per
week, visiting these friends. This extensive time spent away from home has not only reduc ed her
physical presence in our children's lives but also impacted her emotional availability to them.
More concerning is the complete lack of effort on  part to communicate effectively
about the children’s needs, their daily routines, and their emotional well -being since the divorce
announcement. This breakdown in communication is critical, as co -parenting effectively is
paramount for the children's adjustment to the changes in our family structure. The inability or
unwillingness to engage in meaningful dialogue regarding our children’s care is not in their best
interest and is counterproductive to their needs during this challenging time.
5.Contradicting  and False Statements
Throughout  the ongoing divorce proceedings, there have been several instances of contradictory
and demonstrably false statements made by  which have significantly complicated and
distorted the case. A critical point of contention is  claim regarding her inability to pay,
which is incongruent with the financial facts presented. Additi onally, her request for the waiver
of the standard 60 -day waiting period for divorce, citing an alleged order that found I had
committed family violence, is entirely baseless and untrue.
There is no evidence or record to substantiate claims of family violence in our marriage. In fact,
this assertion directly contradicts my clean record and consistent history of being a caring and
non-violent partner and father. The accusation appears to be  a strategic move to gain an unfair
advantage in the divorce proceedings.
Furthermore,  actions in filing a protective order, followed by the initiation of an
eviction process, appear to be coordinated attempts to remove me from our family home.
Notably, the eviction notice cited the protective order as a reason, even though  the protective
order had not been filed at the time of the eviction notice. This sequence of events points
towards a premeditated strategy to unfairly influence the custody and property aspects of our
divorce.
Given these concerning developments, it is imperative  that this counter petition replace the
original . This counter -petition is not just a necessary step to address the false allegations and
APPENDIX 64

contradicting statements made by  but also a crucial measure to ensure a fair and 
equitable trial , and t o correct the inaccuracies made by  on the original petition.  It is 
essential to have the appropriate amount of time and a factual basis for the proceedings to 
ensure that any decisions made, particularly those affecting our children’s future and well -being, 
are based on truth and justice, rather than unfounded alle gations. This approach will also 
facilitate a smoother and more amicable transition for all parties involved, especially for our 
children, who are of utmost importance in this process.  
II. EVIDENCE TO BE PRESENTED
1.Text Message Evidence:
I will present text interactions between myself and the Plaintiff that show my attempts to work
towards a resolution and her avoidance of communication and accountability.
2.Data Analysis and Phone/Text Logs:
I have prepared charts and graphs created from our joint account's text and phone call logs.
These will illustrate the extreme levels of interaction the Plaintiff had with  and
highlighting her priorities outside of our marriage.  This priority in her fr iends has remained
consistent - even throughout the divorce proceedings .
3.No History of Family Violence:
I will present my criminal record from the Texas Department of Public Safety, proving the
absence of any history of family violence .
4.Bank Statements and Financial Transactions:
Evidence of bank transactions will demonstrate financial maneuverings by the Plaintiff, advised
by   affecting our joint account.
5.Eviction Notice and Protective Order Claims:
I have the eviction notice served to me, which was later voided, and evidence related to the
protective order, demonstrating the misuse of legal processes to influence our divorce and
custody proceedings.
APPENDIX 65

III. CHILDREN'S WELFARE AND FAMILY STABILITY
The children's welfare remains my primary concern. The Plaintiff's actions, influenced by third parties 
and her unfounded claims, threaten our children's stability and well -being. I advocate for maintaining 
the standard 60 -day waiting period for the divorc e to provide our children with a stable and gradual 
transition.  
Since the divorce announcement, I have remaine d an active role in my children ’s lives, finding activities 
for us to do together due to their time off from school. Desp ite all inclusion efforts –  has 
declined to join us on these ac tivities  – something the children  don’t understand  and have taken notice 
to.  on the other hand, has been extremely short with the children, impatient, and has kept her 
priorities in line with her friends . 
IV.PROPOSAL FOR INTER IM CUSTODY ARRANGEMENT
Considering  the current complexities surrounding our divorce proceedings, and with the paramount goal 
of ensuring the best interests and minimal disruption to our children’s lives, I propose the following 
interim custody arrangement:  
1.Full Custody Arrangement
I propose to take on full custody of our children,  and  This decision is motivated by the 
need to provide them with a stable and consistent environment, especially during this transitional 
phase of our family's life. My commitment to their da y-to-day needs, emotional well -being, and 
continued growth has been and will remain unwavering.  
2.Co-Habitation in Current Family Home:
Recognizing the importance of maintaining a sense of normalcy for our children, I suggest that we 
continue to cohabit in our current family home. This arrangement will prevent any immediate 
upheaval in the children's living environment, allowing them to re tain their sense of security and 
familiarity amidst the ongoing changes , and will afford  the opportunity to find full -time 
stable employ ment, and allow me to continue making rent payments to her grandmother, our 
landlord. This is in the best interest of all parties involved.  
3.Transition to a New Home
 I am planning to move out of my current family home with the children, but only when a suitable 
and equally accommodating residence is secured. The aim is to ensure this new home is near  our 
APPENDIX 66

current location, thus allowing the children to remain in their current school and maintain their 
usual routines and social connections.  
4. Active Roles for Both Parents  
 It is imperative that both  and I continue to play active roles in our children's lives. The 
proposed arrangement is designed to facilitate this by ensuring that the children have regular and 
consistent access to both parents. This continued parental  presence will be crucial in minimizing the 
emotional and psychological impact of our separation on  and  
 
Mitigating Potential Damage: The current petition, as it stands, poses a significant risk of causing 
disruption and potential harm to our children's well-being.  
by abruptly altering their living situation and limiting their access to one parent. My proposal aims to 
mitigate this damage by providing a more balanced and thoughtful approach to the transition, one 
that prioritizes the emotional and psychological healt h of our children above all else.  
Flexibility and Cooperation: This proposal is made with a spirit of flexibility and cooperation, 
understanding that the situation may evolve as we navigate this process. I am open to discussions 
and modifications to this plan, if they serve the best interests of  and  
Professional Support if Needed: To aid in this transition and to ensure that the emotional needs of 
our children are being met, I also propose that we engage the services of a child psychologist or a 
family counselor. This professional can provide support to  and  helping them to 
understand and adapt to the changes in their family dynamics.  
Regular Review and Adjustment of the Arrangement: I propose that this interim custody 
arrangement be subject to regular review, with the possibility of adjustments based on the evolving 
needs of our children and our family situation. This will ensure that the arrangement remains 
relevant and beneficial for  and  
 
V. PRAYER  
 
WHEREFORE, premises considered, I respectfully request that the Court consider this Counter -Petition 
for Divorce with due diligence. My earnest prayer is for a fair and just resolution that corrects the 
inaccuracies in the original petition and uncovers th e true nature of the events leading to the divorce 
announcement. It is vital that these matters are resolved amicably, prioritizing the best interests of our 
children,  and  I seek a fair outcome that recognizes the complexities of our situation and 
promotes a stable, nurturing environment for our family moving forward.  
Respectfully submitted,

APPENDIX 69

STATEMENT  
I,    submit this unsworn declaration to recount the events since
December 1st, 2023, when my wife,    unexpectedly declared
her wish for a divorce. The announcement was not only ill-timed but also perplexing in
its lack of substantiated reasoning or opportunity for reconciliation.
At noon that day,  cited 'the way I talk to her' as her rationale for the divorce.
Despite her evolving reasons, I extended apologies and exhaustively sought resolution,
yet my every attempt to discuss our daughters' future and our family's welfare was met
with hostility or outright  by 
The abruptness of Morgan's hostility compelled me to seek deeper insight. Upon
examining our AT&T records, I found an alarmingly high volume of communication
between  and two individuals:  and  These findings were
troubling, especially given the children's scant interaction with  family despite
 extensive evening visits. When presented with this evidence, 
downplayed its significance and persisted in her communications and visits, placing
them above resolving our marital issues.
After sharing my concerns with her grandparents, our landlords, the dynamics shifted
abruptly. Within days,  began to systematically exclude me from the family
narrative surrounding the divorce.
The situation intensified on December 14th, 2023, with the involvement of 
 her mother's boyfriend.  contacted me, purporting to mediate our
divorce impartially, yet his subsequent actions—advising  facilitating a transfer
of funds from our account to his PayPal, and overdrawn our joint account—belied his
stated intentions. This financial maneuvering, coupled with  claim that  is
"his client," despite lacking a legal license in Texas, underscores a deceitful
manipulation of the facts.
 subsequent visit to  in Oklahoma for the divorce petition preparation
and the acquisition of a second phone coincided with a conspicuous halt in her
communications with   and  as evidenced in the AT&T records.
On December 17th, 2023, I was served an eviction notice by  grandmother—a
notice that cited a divorce and a protective order not yet filed, revealing a preconceived
strategy to undermine my paternal rights and disrupt our daughters' stability,
particularly before the Christmas season.
The subsequent protective order filed on December 22nd, 2023, and the divorce
petition,
APPENDIX 70

STATEMENT  
paint a unilateral narrative of events. Throughout this ordeal,  has actively
excluded me from our daughters' lives and neglected to pursue employment or engage
in any dialogue regarding their future.
Conversely, I have remained steadfast in my parental duties, inviting  to
participate in our daughters' lives, only to be rebuffed at every turn. Her behavior and
legal actions, which starkly contradict her claims of fear, suggest an attempt to evade
accountability rather than protect herself from any purported threat.
The chain of events illustrates a concerted effort by  and her family to extricate
me from our home, leveraging unfounded legal allegations and an eviction suit without
considering the facts or the impact on our daughters.
It is my firm belief that  actions are self-serving, aimed at avoiding
responsibility for her actions rather than safeguarding our children. Hence, I implore
this court to recognize the inconsistencies in  claims and to view subsequent
allegations with a discerning eye, considering their strategic nature.
In conclusion, I respectfully request the court to deny the protective order and impose
sanctions on   for his role in the marital discord that has ensued since
the announcement. It is essential for our daughters' stability and well-being that the full
truth of this matter be brought to light and considered in these proceedings.

APPENDIX 90

IN THE 322nd DISTRICT  COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY  
STATE OF TEXAS  
 e ,  Cause No. 322 -744263 -23 
Petitioner,  
v. 
Emergency Motion to Reconsider  
Evidence  and to Vacate Temporary 
Orders  
  ,  
Respondent  
This motion urgently calls for the Court's intervention to address critical procedural 
missteps in the matter of cause# 322 -744263 -23, aiming to reinstate the safety and stability 
that our children rightfully deserve  until due process and all facts of the case can be considered 
by the Court. I am seeking immediate court intervention to correct procedural errors and 
address the misuse of the legal system by the Petitioner. This motion highlights the significant 
impact of the Petitioner's actions on our children's welfare and my unjust removal from our 
home based on frivolous claims.  
In pursuit of justice and the well -being of the children at heart, I respectfully request that 
the Court reconsider all details, weighing the comprehensive scenario presented herein along 
with the supporting evidence. I am committed to the highest interests of my children and 
family, striving to resolve these matters efficiently and avoid unnecessary judicial expenditure. 
This document seeks to unveil the Petitioner ’s deliberate misrepresentation and misuse of the 
legal system, which has gravely disrupted our children's stability and emotional well -being by 
weaponizing the court system . 
¹ On December 1st, 2023, the Petitioner announced her desire for a divorce with no plan in place to preserve our 
familial stability, with no desire for counseling  or communication, and with no consideration of the timing around 
the holiday season, nor any sign of marital discord warranting such a decision leading up to this announcement.  
² Between December 14th, 2023, and December 2 2nd, 2023, the Petitioner filed for an Emergency Protective 
Order , a Divorce Petition, a Protective Order, and instigated an Eviction suit.  
APPENDIX 91

NATURE OF SUITS AND THIRD -PARTY INFLUENCE  
1. On December 1st, 2023, Petitioner announced the divorce  with no plan in place for the 
children, no sign of marital discord leading up to this point to warrant such a decision, 
and no desire for counseling , communication, and no consideration for the time of year.  
 
2. Between December 1st, 2023,  and December 12th, 2023 , all efforts are exhausted in an 
attempt to communicate with the Petitioner  which lead to the subsequent discovery of an 
alarming volume of text messages that were directed towards two individuals –  
 and   showing a significant level of influ ence.³ 
 
 
3. On December 1 2th, 2023 , After the discovery of the communications between these two 
individuals combined with the irrational behavior from the Petitioner  during such a 
critical time of year , I reached out to the Petitioner ’s grandfather  via text message. ⁴ 
 
4. On December 13th, 2023 , Petitioner states she will be going to talk to her Grandparents 
alone. This conversation lasts between 9: 55 and 1:30 A.M.  
 
 
5. On December 14th, 2023 , Petitioner  filed for an Emergency Protective Order. This order 
was denied by the court.  
 
6. On December 15th, 2023 , Petitioner involves her family into the situation.       
Particularly,   became involved. He is the boyfriend of the Petitioner ’s 
Mother . Shortly thereafter, I received a notice from our joint bank account stating that 
$1,576 had just been withdrawn . As our bank statement for December 2023 will 
demonstrate – the transaction record shows the funds being transferred directly to Mr. 
 PayPal  account. ⁵  
 
³ See attached EXHIBIT A. 1 – A true and accurate copy of the  AT&T text logs filtered by relevant parties. Parties 
include  Meme, Papaw,   and  Dates and times surrounding the case will corroborate with other 
evidence presented herein.  See page 456 – 458. 
⁴ See attached EXHIBIT A. 2 – A true and accurate copy of the referenced text message  in paragraph 3. 
⁵ See attached EXHIBIT A.3 – The t rue and accurate b ank statement reflecting the transaction referenced in 
paragraph 6. 
-2- 
APPENDIX 92

7.On December 16th, 2023 , Petitioner ’s transaction under the advice of Mr.
lead to our joint bank account becoming $ -800 overdrawn . I request ed from Mr.
 via text message that he needs to return the funds immediatel y, where he
subsequently admits to this transaction having occurred .⁶
8.On December 17th, 2023, Petitioner’s grandmother,  initiates an Eviction
Suit by serving me an eviction notice around 11:00 AM CST .
9.On December 18th, 2023  – Petitioner writes “VOID” on the Eviction Notice, and
physically tears it in half. ⁷
10. On December 19th, 2023 , Mr.  uses intimidation tactics by impersonating an
attorney despite having no license to practice law in the State of Texas .⁸
11. On December 27th, 2023, I am served the Divorce Papers by the Constable .
12. On December 28th, 2023, I am served the Protective Order , followed by the Eviction
shortly thereafter by the Constable .
The Protective Order  (Show Cause)  hearing was set for January 16th, 2024 , and the Eviction 
hearing for January 17th, 2024.  
The documented timeline of events, particularly during the holiday season, underscores  a 
notable disregard for our children's welfare. This has enabled the Petitioner to inappropriately 
utilize the judicial system to disrupt the stable environment our children have known, 
influenced significantly by third -party actions as previously detaile d. The forthcoming section of 
this motion will highlight the specific frivolous claims and false statements  found within each 
filing  initiated b y the Petitioner.

FRIVOLOUS CLAIMS  AND FALSE STATEMENTS
A. EMERGENCY PROTECTIVE ORDER
1.As mentioned above, Petitioner filed for an Emergency Protective Order on
December 14th, 2023. This protective order was denied by the courts.  
2.Due to the fact this order was not granted by the court, one could conclude that
there was not a clear and present danger of family violence. ¹ 
B. THE DIVORCE PETITION
1. Petition was filed on 2024 -12-18 under an Affidavit of Inability to pay.²
2.The Petitioner's action of filing for divorce under an Affidavit of Inability to pay
three days  after transferring $1,576 to herself starkly contravenes the mandates 
set forth in Chapter 10, Section 10.001 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code . This 
section asserts that each claim or legal contention must be warranted by existing 
law or a nonfrivolous argument for the modification of existing law or the 
establishment of new law, and that each factual contention has or is likely to have 
evidentiary support aft er further investigation or discovery ³. 
3. The Petitioner violate d Chapter 10, Section 10.001 a second time within the
same document when she intentionally elect ed to waive the 60 -day waiting 
period claiming to have an active protective order against me that found family 
violence had occurred during our marriage ⁴ despite being denied such an order
just five days prior on December 14th, 2023 .  
5.The final page of the Divorce Petition  for service to the Office of the Attorney
General  was left unsigned by the Petitioner.

³ CIVIL PRACTICE AND REMEDIES CODE, TITLE 2,  SUBTITLE A,  CHAPTER 10, Sec. 10.001.  
⁴ TEXAS FAMILY CODE, Sec. 6.405 – The petitioner shall attach to the petition a copy of each order described by
Subsection (a)(1) . No such order , as required,  was attached to the divorce petition, because no such order exists .

APPENDIX 94

C. EVICTION  SUIT
1. The suit was unlawful by nature ⁵, as the grounds for eviction were based on
family status,  referencing the divorce as well as  a protective order that had been 
denied on December 14th, 2023.  The suit was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction  on 
January 17th, 2024.⁶ 
D. PROTECTIVE ORDER
1. This suit was the second attempt by the Petitioner  to have me removed from
the home , which ultimately succeeded . 
2. The claims with in this suit mentioned se xually aggressive comments  and
threatening behavior. These allegations are ma terially false, as the Petitioner  
possess es no evidence, and has presented no evidence in relation to th ese claims  
since the initiation of the suit. Despite this , as video and image evidence will show  
once a fair trial date is se t, the Petitioner and I continued to maintain stability at 
our family home and  preserved the sense o f normal cy that our daughters have 
been a ccustomed to their entire lives  up until January 16th, 2024 . 
The Court's decision  to remove me from my home and my children ’s lives on January 
16th, 202 4, albeit preliminary  and unjusti fied, bypassed  the safeguarding of the children's 
emotional, psychological, and physical well -being. This oversight is compounded by the 
Petitioner's actions . The juxtaposition of the Court's decision against the backdrop of the 
Petitioner's inattention to the children's needs illuminates a disconcerting disregard for the 
paramount principle that custody determinations should primarily serve the children's best 
interests.  The final section of this moti on will highlight the procedural aspects of t he events 
unfolding between the dates of January 16th, 2024,  and February  1st, 2024 , and pray the court 
will rec tify this situatio n by restoring the sta bility to our family by vacating the current 
temporary order s that are in place until a proper investigation can be completed by the courts.

APPENDIX 95

THE PROTECTIVE ORDE R HEARINGS  
1.In preparation for the Protective Order  hearing  on January 16th, 2024 , I filed with the
Court an answer to  the Protective Order on January 2nd, 202 4 as well as two motions – a
motion to consolidate the divorce with the protective order, filed on January 4th, 2024, as
well as a motion of continuance , filed on January 8th, 2024  for the purpose to  acquire
counsel  due to the complex nature of the ca se.¹ All three filings were accepted by the
court .
2.On January 16th, 2024, both parties sought additional time to secure legal
representation. Despite not reviewing any evidence, witness testimonies, or documents
related to the motions, and acknowledging the denial of a previous Emergency Protective
Order, the court mandated my departure from our home within four hours. This
decision, unexpectedly made, awarded custody to the Petitioner, overlooking my
concerns about the adverse effects on our children and my work from home. This ruling,
which both parties d id not sign, set the case to resume on January 22nd, 2024, to allow
time for obtaining counsel .²
3.Following the court's directive, I relocated to my father's residence in Flower Mound until
the subsequent hearing . During this interval, the P etitioner did not take the initia tive to
have the children call once and  did not provide any information as to how they were
doing,  showcasing her lack of empathy and concern for our children ’s well -being and
stability . After incurring substantial expenses to secure representation, I detailed my case
and concerns to my attorney, preparing for the next court appearance .
4.On January 22nd, 2024,  the Petitioner  chose to seek legal representation just minutes
before the hearing  was due to start, indicating a disregard for the process. My lawyer
recommended agreeing to a continuance, thereby extending the period I couldn't work
and impacting our established family dynamics. This resulted in a third hearing being set
for February 1st, coinciding with my birthday , and a second rendition being ordered. ³
¹ See attached EXHIBIT C.1 – A true and accurate copies of all referenced filings in paragraph 1.
² See attached EXHIBIT C.2 – A true and acc urate copy of the u nsigned rendition  ordered on January 16th, 2024.

APPENDIX 96

5.On February 1st, 2024, during the third hearing, the substantive issues I had raised were
not addressed, nor was there any exchange of evidence between our legal representatives. 
Despite the focus of the hearing supposed to be on the protective order, the discussions 
veered into custody and child support matters. My lawyer presented the sole option of a 
temporary return to the family home for 30 days with expanded visitation rights, coupled 
with a child support obligation  starting in April. This outcome, which diverged significantly 
from the case's core issues, compelled me to reconsider my legal representation. 
Consequently, I decided to terminate my attorney's services and embarked on drafting this 
motion myself, aiming to bring the court's  attention back to the pivotal elements of the case 
that had thus far been neglected  while able to legally reside in my home . 
CONCLUSION AND PRAYER  
In conclusion, this motion has laid bare the stark realities and procedural aberrations that have 
marred the essence of justice and due process in the matter of Cause No. 322 -744263 -23. 
Through the course of these proceedings, it has become abundantly clea r that the actions taken 
by the Petitioner,   , have not only disregarded the welfare and best 
interests of our children but have also illuminated her unfitness as a parent. Her actions speak 
to a pattern of deceit, manipulation, and an unsettling willingness to leverage the judicial 
system for personal vendettas, all at the expense of the emotional and psychological well -being 
of our children.  
The court, in its decisions, inadvertently facilitated this troubling trajectory by removing me, 
  , from the lives of our children based on unsubstantiated claims and 
without due consideration of my role as a devoted and stable parent. T his oversight has not 
only disrupted the lives of our children but has also significantly impaired my ability to provide 
for them, casting a long shadow over their future stability and welfare.  
Moreover, the conduct of my Counsel  involved has further compounded these issues, 
demonstrating a distressing disregard for the intricate dynamics and facts of this case. This has 
culminated in a situation where the paramount importance of the children's best interests and 
the fundamental p rinciples of fairness and justice have been overshadowed by procedural 
missteps and a lack of thorough investigation into the Petitioner's fitness as a parent.  
-7-
APPENDIX 97

Therefore, it is with a heavy hearted  yet unwavering resolve that I implore the Court to take 
immediate and decisive action to rectify these wrongs. Specifically, I respectfully request the 
Court to:  
1.Vacate the existing temporary orders that unjustly removed me from my home and
separated me from my children, restoring the status quo ante until a thorough and
unbiased evaluation of the facts can be conducted , as the Texas Constituti on requires.  If
left as it stands , these orders will further compound the issues at hand , and will
exacerbate the chaos introduced into the children ’s lives .
2.Set a fair hearing date to delve into the substantive issues at hand, ensuring that all
parties are given an equitable opportunity to present their case and that the best
interests of our children are placed at the forefront of all considerations.
3.Scrutinize any response or new claims from the Petitioner or her counsel with the utmost
diligence, given the established pattern of deceitful and manipulative behavior exhibited
by the Petitioner throughout these proceedings.
4.Consider awarding me full custody of our children, ensuring their continued access to a
stable, nurturing environment, and the consistent provision of their needs, which I am
fully committed to upholding. Furthermore, in alignment with my enduring belief i n the
importance of both parents in the lives of our children, I pledge to facilitate and
encourage a healthy, constructive relationship between the children and their mother,
provided she demonstrates a genuine commitment to their well -being and stability .
5.In seeking these remedies, I do so not out of vindictiveness but from a place of deep
concern for the welfare of our children and a steadfast belief in the principles of justice
and fairness. Despite the pain and turmoil of these proceedings, my ultimate d esire is for
peace and the best possible outcome for all parties involved, most importantly, our
children. It is my sincere hope that the Court will recognize the gravity of the situation
and act in a manner that prioritizes the well -being of our children,  ensuring their return
to a life marked by stability  and l ove.
I affirm under penalty of perjury that all clai ms herein  are tru e and accur ate to the best of my 
knowledge . 
Respectfully submitted  on this 9th day of February  2024,

IN THE 322nd DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY  
STATE OF TEXAS  
  ,  Cause No. 322 -744263 -23 
Petitioner,  
v. 
RESPONDENT’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL 
SUMMARY JUDGEMENT  
  ,  
Respondent  
Pursuant to Rule 166a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure ¹, the Respondent,  
 , firmly seeks a partial Summary Judgment  in regard to  the upcoming 
hearing scheduled for March 14th, 2024 . He categorically asserts that the evidence on file 
with the Court definitively demonstrates there is no genuine issue as to any material fact 
related to the allegations against him which have led to his unwarranted removal from 
his home, significantly disrupted his business operations, and unjustly grante d the 
Petitioner full custody of their children and possession of the family home  on a 
temporary basi s. 
The Respondent has meticulously and persistently contested the baseless allegations of 
family violence that have unjustly prejudiced the custody resolution to the detriment of 
the children's interests. The absence of substantive evidence supporting these claims has 
been made clear through detailed submissions. ²  This unwarranted influence on custody  
¹ Rule 166a specifically allows for summary judgment when "the pleadings, depositions, answers to 
interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine 
issue as to any material fact and that the moving  party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." This 
provision is utilized here to highlight the lack of factual dispute regarding the allegations of family 
violence  which have led to the continuation of unlawful temporary orders currently in place . 
² Submissions on record filed by the Respondent: Motion of Continuance (granted), Motion of 
Consolidation (granted), Protective Order Answer (ignored), Counter Petition for Divorce (ignored), 
Motion of Withdrawal for Attorney (granted), Emergency Motion of Reconsideration of Evidence and to 
Vacate Temporary Orders (Scheduled for March 14th, 2024) . See attach ed EXHIBIT A.  322-744263-23

APPENDIX 102

arrangements negate  the principles of fairness and due process. The subsequent 
dismissal of the Protective Order suit not only vindicates the Respondent but also 
invalidates the current custody orders, revealing that the initial award of custody was  
grounded solely in unsubstantiated claims of family violence. ³ 
 
BACKGROUND  
The documents on record  filed by the Respondent , by virtue of their acceptance , 
inherently meet the threshold for self -authentication, thereby bolstering the legal 
foundation for the requested partial Summary Judgment. Detailed herewith are the 
enumerated  facts underpinning this motion:  
1. On December 14th, 2023, the Petitioner sought an EX -PARTE Order of 
Protection from the Court, which was judiciously denied, affirming the 
absence of immediate threat or harm that warranted such an extraordinary 
measure. Undeterred by this judicial determin ation, the Petitioner proceeded 
to file for divorce on December 18th, 2023, misleadingly alleging the existence 
of an active Order of Protection against the Respondent. This deliberate 
misrepresentation constitutes not merely an attempt to skew the legal p rocess 
in the Petitioner’s favor but represents a flagrant abuse of the judicial system 
designed to secure an undue advantage in the divorce proceedings, which ha s 
ultimately been successful.  
 
2. On December 22nd, 2023, the Petitioner initiated a subsequent application for 
a Protective Order, forming the cornerstone of litigation since the initial 
hearing on January 16th, 2024.  
 
3. On January 16th, 2024, the Court  rendered Temporary Orders which required 
the Respondent to vacate his family home and  give up custody of his children 
on the presumption of family violence. The Court’s decision did not meet the 
statutory requirements of the Texas Family Code, Sec. 6.502. ⁴ 
 
³ The non-suit of the protective order entitles the Respondent to this Partial Summary Judgement as a 
matter of law, as there is now no genuine dispute over the baselessness of the allegations made against 
him which are the foundation of the current temporary orders in place.  
⁴ Sec. 6.502 mandates that a Court may make such a decision while a suit for dissolution of a marriage is 
pending and on the motion of a party or on the court's own motion after notice and hearing . No hearing 
took place, and no reasonable notice was given prior to the decision rendered on January 16th, 2024.

APPENDIX 103

4. On January 22nd, 2024, before the start of the reset hearing, the Petitioner   
acquired legal counsel at the last minute, delaying the case further until the 
reset date of February 1st, 2024 . 
 
5. On February 1st, 2024, both parties entered into an agreement which allowed 
the respondent back into the home on a temporary basis, yet still awarded the 
Petitioner with full custody of the children.  The Respondent was given 30 days 
per the agreement to remain in the home. Despite having the ability to stay 
next door, and after dropping the Protective Suit that initiated and are the 
foundation for this agreement , the Petitioner chose to stay with her friend 9 
miles away and remove the children from their stable environment . 
 
6. On February 5th, 2024, the Respondent discharged his Legal Counsel for failure 
to address any of the issues  mentioned herewith, and for failure to diligently 
represent the Respondent, as no genuine effort was made to make the court 
aware of these errors.  The Protective Order suit was non -suited on this day, 
invalidating the current agreement, and requiring by law that the Court reset 
the case back to the status quo ante until a fair discovery process can be 
conducted on relevant matters to the divorce proceeding, and restoring order 
back into the lives of the Respondent and his Children.  
 
7. The Petitioner's decision to reside outside the family home, despite alternatives 
that would minimize disruption during this transitional period, is a deliberate 
choice. This choice, made independently, should not facilitate the continuation 
of unfounded c laims that have since been dismissed. Such actions have unduly 
influenced the living arrangements and well -being of the children at the heart 
of this case . 
 
8. The Respondent explicitly refrains from pursuing any sanctions or penalties 
against the Petitioner, emphasizing instead a heartfelt plea for a reasonable 
transition period. This adjustment period is advocated as crucial for 
safeguarding the welfare of his children, himself, and the Petitioner, ensuring 
their collective long -term well -being. Furthermore, the Respondent 
underscores that the prevailing custody determinations were unjustly 
predicated on unsubstantiated allegations of family violence —a point 
underscored by the unequivocal dismissal of the Protective Order, which 
confirms the absence of any contested material facts .

APPENDIX 104

LEGAL BASIS  
The legal foundation for this Partial Summary Judgment is firmly rooted in the principles 
and mandates of the law, notably where the current temporary orders are predicated on 
unsubstantiated claims of family violence, for which no concrete evidence has been 
presented. This lack of evidence fundamentally challenges the integrity and validity of 
the orders affectin g the lives and welfare of the children involved. The necessity for the 
court to vacate these orders and revert to the status quo ante is underscored by the 
following critical legal argument s: 
1 . Misalignment with Texas Family Code Sec. 105.001:   
 
1.1 The orders issued on January 16th, 2024, and continued on January 
22nd, 2024, starkly conflict with Texas Family Code Sec. 105.001, which 
unequivocally necessitates notice and a hearing prior to the issuance of 
such orders. This statute ensures that partie s are given a fair opportunity to 
be heard, a fundamental aspect of due process, which was conspicuously 
absent in this case.  
 
2. Contravention of Texas Family Code Sec. 105.005:  
2.1 The initial rendering of temporary orders on January 16th, 2024, did 
not adhere to Texas Family Code Sec. 105.005 , requiring that court's 
findings be grounded in a preponderance of the evidence  before making 
any child custody determination affecting the parent -child relationship .  
 
2.2 The absence of evidence from the Petitioner, juxtaposed with the 
disregard for the Respondent's timely submissions, underscores a 
significant deviation from this legal requirement.  
 
3. Violation of Texas Family Code Sec. 153.002:   
 
3.1 The proceedings failed to prioritize "The best interest of the child," as 
mandated by Texas Family Code Sec. 153.002. This principle, deemed 
paramount in determining issues of conservatorship, possession, and 
access, was overlooked.  
 
3.2 The Respondent's work -from-home situation and the need for a  
-4- 
Copy from re:SearchTX
APPENDIX 105

reasonable transition period to maintain his pivotal role in his children ’s 
lives were disregarded, further exacerbating the impact of the Petitioner ’s 
actions and the court ’s decisions on the children ’s stability and well -being.  
4. Equal Opportunity and Fair Hearing (Sec. 152.205 & Sec. 105.003):  
4.1 The Texas Family Code Sec. 152.205  and Sec. 105.003  enshrine the 
necessity for equitable procedural rights, mandating that all parties are 
granted a fair opportunity for notification and a meaningful hearing. The 
Respondent ’s ability to engage fully in the hearing process and to present a 
comprehensive defense was significantly impeded, a deviation from the 
due process envisaged by these statutes. Consequently, the temporary 
orders issued lack the foundational fairness that i s central to the justice 
system and contravene the legal safeguards intended to ensure balanced 
participation by all parties in family law proceedings.  
 
5. Managing Conservatorship Considerations (Sec. 153.005 & Sec. 153.007):  
5.1 In deliberations of conservatorship, Texas Family Code Sec. 153.005 
obligates the court to deliberate thoroughly on the child ’s best interest, 
including the living circumstances and stability provided by the parents. 
Additionally, Sec. 153.007  advocates for the establishment of a mutually 
agreed parenting plan, prioritizing the child ’s welfare and the continuity of 
their established routine. The current  custodial provisions do not 
correspond with a collaboratively designed parenting plan that satisfies 
these essential criteria. Given the disproven allegations of family violence 
and the unnecessary protective measures imposed during this period of 
change, it is imperative for the Court to rescind these provisional measures. 
The immediate restoration of the status quo ante is crucial to uphold the 
children ’s best interest, allowing for a planned and considerate period of 
adjustment that acknowledges the absence of any immediate risk or harm 
to their well -being  and without disruption to the Respondent’s business 
operations at -home.  
 
6. Rules of Dispositions for Family Law Cases – (Tarrant County Rules):  
6.1 The provisions under Rule 4.02: Trial Procedures of the Tarrant Family 
Rules , specifically Part 4  concerning the disposition of family law cases, 
have been notably contravened in the ongoing proceedings of the. This rule

STATEMENTS OF FACT  
Below are the enumerated statements of fact  with no genuine dispute of material fact  
that entitle the Respondent to this Partial Summary Judgement:  
1.The Petitioner has not provided any evidence of Family Violence .⁶ These claims
unjustly removed the Respondent from his home starting on January 16th, 2024
and significantly impaired his at -home business operations , and are the basis for
the current custodial arrangements  which are unlawful and founded on false
claims.⁷
2.No basis exists for the current arrangements, as the Court has no t considered the
best interests of the children throughout this case, but rather has operated solely
on the accusations of family violence, which are now non -suited.⁸
3.The deadline approaching  March 1st to vacate,  and the current custodial
arrangements are void of any lawful basis . Any custodial arrangements are
required to consider  the best interests of the children involved .
4.Respondent’s parenting plan has been overlooked by the Court, filed January 6th,
2024.⁹
5.The Court’s basis for conservatorship was based solely on the claims of Family
Violence, which are now void.
6.The respondent is entitled to this Partial Summary Judgement as a matter of law,
which will rightfully restore the status quo ante  given no genuine dispute of
material fact exists regarding family violence, which are the basis for the ongoing
and current orders.
⁶ There exist no evidence supporting family violence on record, nullifying any custodial arrangements  
based on these foundational claims  alone .

APPENDIX 107

PRAYER FOR RELIEF  
WHEREFORE,  , the Respondent herein, respectfully requests  this 
Honorable Court to:  
1. Annul the current temporary custody and visitation arrangements premised on 
allegations now proven to be baseless, taking into account the critical urgency 
imposed by the Respondent’s work -from -home requirements and the ongoing 
detriment to his familial re lationships.  
 
2. Recognize that the initial accusations of family violence, which underpinned 
the imposition of these temporary measures, were not substantiated by 
credible evidence. This failure has unjustly prejudiced the Respondent, 
undermining his right to an equitable  adjudication and rendering the imposed 
measures legally untenable.  
 
 
3. Acknowledge the absence of substantial evidence for the allegations levied 
against the Respondent. Command a thorough reevaluation of both procedural 
and substantive legal missteps observed in the prevailing proceedings, with a 
view to rectifying the inequ itable temporary orders that have adversely 
impacted the Respondent’s familial and professional life.  
 
4.  In accordance with Rule 166a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule 
60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, award relief predicated on 
identifiable mistakes, errors, and the conspicuous lack of evidential foundation 
for the accusations face d by the Respondent.  
 
 
5. Uphold Fairness and Due Process: Reorient the ongoing legal process to align 
strictly with the principles of fairness, due process, and the paramount 
interests of the children involved. This reorientation is essential to ensure the 
administration of justic e, uphold the Respondent’s inalienable right to a fair 
trial, and ameliorate the unwarranted disruptions to his familial life.  
 
6. Consideration of Respondent’s Efforts: Reflect on the substantial time and 
effort dedicated by the Respondent in pursuit of equitable treatment under the  
 
-8- 
Copy from re:SearchTX
APPENDIX 108

law and the significant repercussions stemming from his unjust displacement 
based on allegations now demonstrated to be without merit.  
7.Reestablish the custodial and visitation status quo ante pending a lawful and
unbiased reevaluation of the custody determination, ensuring that any future
decisions are made in a manner that genuinely reflects the best interests of the

IN THE 322nd DISTRICT  COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY  
STATE OF TEXAS  
, Cause No. 322 -744263 -23 
Petitioner,  
v. 
NOTICE AND UNSWORN DECLARATION  
, 
Respondent  
March 3, 2024  
Dear Clerk of the Court,  
This letter is submitted on behalf of the Respondent in the above -referenced case to 
provide the court with an update on the Respondent's efforts to uphold the well -being of 
the children under the current agreed arrangements pending review and to navigate the 
complexities of this case . The following reasons  why i t is impo ssible for the Respondent 
to vacate the family home under the current agreement pending review  are a s follows : 
1.Since the inception of the case, the Respondent's primary focus has been to reset
the status quo ante for the benefit of the children, ensuring their lives remain as
normal and uninterrupted as possible during this transitory period  after it was
significantly disrupted beginning on January 16th, 2024 . Despite the challenges
posed by the non -suited protective order and the dropped allegations of family
violence  which were the foundations of all decisions made within this case , the
Respondent has  respected the orders pending review, and has  strived to provide a
stable and supportive environment for his children during his designated time , all
while planning a transition that best suits his children.
2.During the short amount of time the Respondent has been re -instated to his home,
the Petitioner has, on multiple occasions, entered the residence unannounced and
without prior consent, actions which stand in stark contrast to her prior requests
for protection  which have governed this case .322-744263-23 FILED

APPENDIX 118

3. The Petitioner has changed emplo yers since the signing of the agreement . 
 
4. Petitioner  has relinquished custody of the children to the Respondent on multip le 
days during her scheduled time, showcasing the Respondent ’s ability to care for 
his children  at any time given his at -home work schedule  specifically crafte d to 
ensure participation in e very aspect of his children ’s lives remains  possible . 
 
 
5. The Respondent must dedicate substantial time to researching and understanding 
legal procedures to ensure compliance with court rules and to advocate effectively 
for the best interests of his children.  He is prepared to present all relevant facts 
and evidence at the upcoming hearing  on March 14th , should his partial summary 
judgment not be accepte d. 
 
6. The Respondent has made efforts over the past 30 days to maintain normalcy for 
his children, showcasing his dedication to their well -being. The Respondent has 
maintained an amicable relationship with the  Grandparents residing next -door, 
allowing frequent access during his time with the children to  visit and attend 
church,  main taining normalcy  and peace.  
 
7. The choice to remain outside the home is a deliberate decision by the Petitioner  
during the transition period . Self -hosting and advertising is a n essential 
requirement for my at-home operations, which  is essential to maintain the quality 
of life  our children are accustomed to.  Multiple a lternative housing  options  are 
available to the Petitioner, including the house next door . 
 
The Respondent remains committed to following the court's directives and ensuring the 
best possible outcomes for his children. He appreciates the court's attention to these 
matters and is ready to provide further information or clarification as needed.  
My name is  my date of birth is , and my address is  
 Watauga TX, 76148, United States. I declare under penalty of perjury that the 
foregoing is true and correct.

8 STATEMENT OF THE CASE  
1.Nature of Proceeding(s).  This case memorandum is respectfully
submitted in good faith regarding the underlying legal proceedings
brought against the R espondent  in a systematic and concurrent fashion :
a.Divorce : 322-744263 -23 \ filed 2023 -12-18
b.Protective Order: 322-744538 -23 \ filed 2023 -12-22

2.Judge(s), Court, and County . Hon James B. Munford  && Hon Jeffrey N.
Kaitcer, 322nd (Family) District Court, Tarrant County, Texas
3.Claim of Respondent: The Court  unlawfully removed the Respondent
from his home without a right to legal representation a nd without any
findings of fact  that would warrant such a drastic decisi on which not only
severely damaged the ability of the Respo ndent to provide for them, but
has ultimately left him homeless and the children without one of their
parents  without conducting any discovery or indicating any lawful
reasoning for doing so .

APPENDIX 130

9 ISSUE S PRESENTED  
1.Given evidence suggesting that the Petitioner fabricated allegations of
family violence to secure a tactical advantage in custody and divorce
proceedings, does this raise a significant legal question regarding the
adequacy of safeguards against misuse of p rotective orders, potentially
warranting a review of the court ’s reliance on unverified claims in making
preliminary decisions affecting parental rights and access to children?
2.Considering the absence of concrete evidence indicating an immediate
risk of harm or abuse towards the Petitioner or minor children, did the
Court’s initial decision to issue Temporary Orders on January 16th, 
followed by January 22nd, and February 1st—thereby excluding the 
Respondent from the family residence and severing his relationship with 
his children —constitute an abuse of discretion lacking clear evidence of 
danger for such emergency action, ultimately leading to a violation of the 
Respondent ’s due process and infringement of constitutional and parental 
rights, while also disregarding the children ’s best interest s? 
3.How can the Court remove one parent from the home without following
the mandated process required by law, resulting in the destruction of the
status quo of the minor children, and further uphold this decision  when
no finding of facts has taken place ?

APPENDIX 131

the landlords of the Couple , where they entered into a lease agreement
on July 22nd, 2015.

Copy from re:SearchTX
APPENDIX 132

11 EMPLOYMENT HISTORY  AND FAMILY DYNAMICS  
1.Throughout their marriage, both parents have alternated roles as stay -at-
home parents, adapting their employment status to meet the 
developmental needs and schedules of their children, now aged seven and 
five. This arrangement has enabled both the Petition er and Respondent to 
maintain an active and consistent presence in their children’s lives, 
encompassing not only day -to-day care but also engagement in school 
activities and extracurricular events. This hands -on approach has been a 
testament to their dedic ation to the well -being and upbringing of their 
children, demonstrating a flexible yet committed stance towards 
balancing family responsibilities with personal and professional 
development opportunities as they arise.  
2.The Couple had lived paycheck to paycheck for most of the marriage, and
things began to look up when the Petitioner acquired a job as a Leasing 
Agent/Consultant near our home. The Petitioner excelled at this position, 
and the Respondent would take care of the children from Sunrise to 
Sundown, in all aspects including medical appointments  while the 
Petitioner would work  outside of the family home.  
3.The unique situation the Couple had been blessed with put them in a
situation where the children could frequently visit their grandparents next 
door, creating a rare and ideal situation for them, also enabling the 
Respondent to help generate income by acquiring a part -time Legal 
Copy from re:SearchTX
APPENDIX 133

12 Transcriptionist job from home while the children were in the care of the 
Grandparents.  
4.During May of 2019, the Petitioner was unexpectedly terminated from
her job  as a Leasing Agent , where the Couple once more swapped roles as 
the stay -at-home parent, and the Respondent quickly acquired 
employment at Classic Mazda of Denton, starting on July 1st, 2019. 
5.This transition was very difficult, as the Respondent went from seeing his
children every day to sometimes not at all given the hour -long commute 
to work and extraneous hours and was in an entirely  new field of work  as 
a sales associate.  
6.In the Fall of 2019, the COVID -19 pandemic hit and put the dealership in
a state of uncertainty by significantly reducing the number of patrons 
who would visit the dealership, which impacted the monthly commission 
for the Respondent , creating significant down -time that the Respondent 
took advantage of by self-certifying himself in many areas of the 
dealership.  
7.One evening at  work, the Respondent noticed the Photographer taking
photos of the vehicles  out on the lot  for the purpose of displaying them on 
the dealership’s website,  which sparked an idea that would ultimately 
Copy from re:SearchTX
APPENDIX 134

13 become the sales solution for the dealership during the COVID -19 
pandemic.  
8.In November of 2019, t he Respondent created a YouTube channel
entitled Charlie and the Mazdas, where he began to use his self -
certification for internet sales to create personalized videos for internet 
clients  during the pandemic, allowing them to see the features of their 
desired vehicle from the comfort of their own home. If the client  decided 
to move forward, t he Respondent would wrap the steering wheels in 
plastic wrap, wash the vehicles himself, and drive them to the client’s 
residence as a courtesy service during the pandemic.  
9.This approach  was not only successful but  lead to the Respondent
finishing second overall for the Southwest Region of the United States for 
Mazda sales  for the year of 2020.  
10. The Couple also leased their first vehicle in November of 2019, which was
a Mazda CX -5 Grand Touring model , machine grey. 
11. As the year 2020 unfolded, the Respondent found himself increasingly
drawn to the stock market. This interest was sparked by the extraordinary 
market conditions of 2020, fueled by the Federal Reserve’s pivotal 
amendments to Regulation D and the Supplementa l Leverage Ratio. 
These changes were instrumental in maintaining bank liquidity, enabling 
continued lending to high -risk companies amid the pandemic, presenting 
unique investment opportunities.  
Copy from re:SearchTX
APPENDIX 135

14 12. By January 2021, inspired by his burgeoning passion for financial
markets —and motivated by a desire to reclaim precious time with the 
Children —the Respondent made a conscientious decision to part ways 
with the dealership. This step was taken in good faith, driven by his 
commitment to both his family and his growing interest in financial 
markets, setting the stage for a new chapter in his profess ional and 
personal life since his employment began on July 1st, 2019.  
13. Shortly after starting this new chapter, the Respondent quickly realized
trading was going to be a lot more challenging than he had first realized, 
which lead to the evolution of his YouTube channel, renamed from 
Charlie and the Mazdas to Charlie’s Vids , where he turned his focus to 
SEC law, covering agency filings out of the Options Clearing Corporation, 
National Securities Clearing Corporation, Depository Trust Company, 
Depository Trust Clearing Corporation, FINRA, the Code of Federal 
Regulations, the Off ice of Financial Research, amongst other market 
agencies.  
14. The Respondent would cover the filings, accompanied by PowerPoint
presentations for the viewer, which quickly became well -received, 
garnering the Respondent over 30,000 subscribers by May of 2021.  
Copy from re:SearchTX
APPENDIX 136

15 15. The surge in viewership not only augmented the family’s income but also
established a robust passive income stream for the Respondent and his 
family. This financial uplift empowered him to delve further into the 
intricacies of the financial sector, focusin g on market architecture, the 
mechanics of trading, and the analysis of market data.  
16. By September 12th, 2021, his deepened interest in financial market data
culminated in the launch of a unique  service. This innovative venture 
offered market data solutions to clients through a variety of platforms 
including Discord and Telegram, alongside tailored scanners, feeds, and 
bots. Leveraging Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), 
sophisticated pyth onic programming, and advanced database 
engineering, the Respondent  crafted customizable data streams to meet 
the specific needs of his clientele , all self -taught by the Respondent . 
17. The escalating demands of the Respondent’s business necessitated an
upgrade to more potent computing hardware in February 2022. This 
strategic investment enabled him to further scale his operations, 
propelling the family towards financial independence.  
18. Parallel to the Respondent’s business ascent, the Petitioner took on a
more prominent role within their children ’s educational community. Her 
involvement with the school’s Parent Teacher Association (PTA) 
eventually led her to the presidency, making  a significant contribution to 
their children’s educational environment.  
Copy from re:SearchTX
APPENDIX 137

16 19. The culmination of these endeavors was celebrated with the family’s first
vacation in July 2022.5 They chose South Padre Island, Texas —a place of 
sentimental value, as it was where the Respondent spent many cherished 
moments of his childhood. Staying in the home that hosted his formative 
years, they created new memories as a family, intertwining past and 
present.  
20. Throughout the remainder of the year and into 2023, the couple
continued in their respective roles, gradually drifting apart. The 
Respondent, deeply engrossed in his business, and the Petitioner, 
yearning for new experiences outside the home, unknowingly a llowed a 
gap to form between them, threatening the unity of their marriage. 
Despite this, their commitment to their children ’s welfare remained 
unwavering, a testament to their dedication, as seen in the children ’s 
thriving well -being and exceptional achievements in school and dance.  
21. In July of 2023, the family took another trip to South Padre Island, a
journey that served both to revisit cherished memories and create new 
ones.

APPENDIX 138

17 22. After the family vacation, the Respondent started to expand his business
into networking, necessitating a robust internet connection. He needed to 
secure various services linked to his local IP address and handle a large

25 III. Undisputed Evidentiary Facts
1.The Petitioner , , knowingly  and willingly
deceived  the Court under penalty of Perjury in the following  
manner  since the onset of the case : 
i.The Petitioner knowingly and willingly filed for divorce
claiming an  Affidavit of Inability to P ay just four days after 
emptying the  Couple ’s joint bank account  into 
 PayPal account, where it was subsequently 
transferred to the Petitioner ’s sole bank account , as 
admitted by  himself on December 16th, 
2023. 
ii.The Petitioner knowingly and willingly filed for an
Emergency EX -Parte Order of Protection  on December 14th, 
2023, yet was compelled to invite the Respondent to the 
school field -trip, directly contradicting the need for 
protection from the Respondent.  
iii.The Petitioner was under the influence of ,
who stated his intent to help the Petitioner file the divorce 
paperwork  on December 16th, 2023 , and after the divorce 
was filed,  referred to himself as her attorney  while having 
no license to practice la w in Texas or any other state.  
Copy from re:SearchTX
APPENDIX 147

26 iv.The Petitioner knowingly and willingly waived the 60 -day
waiting period for divorce , citing that an active order of 
protection was currently in place, and that family violence 
had been found  to have occurred  during the Couple ’s 
marriage.  Neither of these statements were true, as the 
Petitioner was denied such an order just four days prior . 
v.The Petitioner knowingly and willingly influenced the
Couple’s landlords into believing that she needed  
protection , which was followed by the initiation o f an 
Eviction suit on Sunday, 12-17-2023 in which the 
Respo ndent prevailed on 01-17-2024  due to lack of 
jurisdiction.  
vi.The Petitioner  filed for a Protective Order on 12 -22-2023,
while subsequently  cohabit ing with the Respondent and the 
Children  that same evening  clearly in n o need of protection.  
vii.The deliberate actions of the Petitioner and her family
members reflect a concerted effort that is both vindictive 
and predatory in nature, indicating a clear conspiracy to 
engage in unlawful conduct11 aimed at depriving the 
Respondent of his parental rights, his ability to  provide , and 
most impor tantly:  damaging  the children ’s well -being . 
11 The Texas Family Law Practice Manual points out a Civil Conspiracy as a valid cause of action for 
divorce proceedings . See § 8.56 , Ch.8  
Copy from re:SearchTX
APPENDIX 148

27 2.The Court has, perhaps unintentionally, endorsed the behavior
detailed in paragraph 1 by failing to thoroughly examine the case ’s 
facts, despite their repeated emphasis throughout these 
proceedings.  
3.The opposing Counsel has not conducted any meaning ful discovery
in this case to warrant any significant decisions  which has 
ultimately damaged the future outlook of the children by awarding 
full custody to the Petitioner  for no valid reason.  The only 
discovery conducted in this case amounts to financial disclosures 
which have since significantly changed,  as the Petitioner h as 
changed empl oyment , and the Respondent has been unable to 
work to full capacity since Ma rch 6th, 2024.  
4.The Petitioner ’s lack of full -time employment raises significant
concerns regarding their ability to meet the financial needs of the 
minor children involved in this case. This issue casts doubt on the 
Court ’s decision to grant the Petitioner full custody and exclusive 
access to the family home. The decision, which appears to have 
been made on subjective grounds, preemptively removed the 
Respondent from the home before they had the opportunity to 
secure legal representation. Such an action not only adversely 
affects the welfare of the children but also constitutes a clear 
misapplication of judicial discretion.  
5.The Court  and Opposing counsel exhibit a strong conflict of
interest, as the opposing Counsel had no initial interest in the 
Copy from re:SearchTX
APPENDIX 149

28 Divorce case, which is reflective in her failure to appropriately 
conduct discovery or d etermine  what is truly in the best interests 
of the children.  
6.The Respon dent would care for the children while the Petitioner
worked her evening shifts multiple times per week.  
7.The Respondent would care for the children in all aspects of their
lives leading up to his removal on January 16th, 202 4, including 
while the Petitioner was out of the home filing for protection 
against him . 12 
8.Both the Respondent and opposing Counsel have intentionally
delayed proceedings and failed to provide any evidence, witness 
lists, documents, or any other tangible items as required by both 
the Local Court Rules and the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.

The Respondent has had one objective throughout this case: 
_________ _________________________________________  
To prioritize the children ’s well -being and uphold the existing familial structure, 
while actively promoting a healthy and ongoing relationship between the children 
and both parents. This commitment is rooted in the understanding that the 
continued involvement of both parents in the  children ’s daily lives is not only 
beneficial but essential for their emotional and psychological development. The 
Respondent seeks to ensure that the children ’s interests are placed at the forefront of 
all decisions, advocating for a stable and nurturing environment that supports their 
growth and well-being , which is not the current environment .

33 THE RESPONDEN T’S EFFORTS  
1.Due to having failed legal representation, the resources required to
acquire alternative Counsel after the termination of Mr. Bacalis  coupled
with the growing dis -trust of the Judicial System as a whole given the
totality of circumstances left the Respondent with having to represent
himself , which is a ta sk he has taken seriously in an effort to advocate for
his daughters in a zealous manner.
2.The Respondent has researched and is aware  of the ever-growing burden
pro-se litigants ar e becoming on the Court s, their staff , and their
resources  due to the vast majority of pro-se litigants not putting in the
time or effort reasonably required to represent themselves effectively or
are solely trying to reduce costs associated with their case, both leading to
increased case lengths and litigation costs .
3.The Respondent in this case stands out from the stereotype as follow s:
a.Since the removal of  his home on January 16th, 202 4, the Respondent
has self -developed software to assist himself in the process  of self -
representation. This sof tware includes a POSTGRES database

b.The Respondent has remained cons istent throughout the proceedings
by denying the false allegations of family violence, pointing out the

c.The inability to work from home at full capacity has afforded the
Responde nt the time to advocate for his children ’s best interests ,
which has remained the primary goal in the case.
d.The Respondent ’s ability to pri oritize h is children despi te the massive
number  of challenge s faced throughout these proceedings starkly
contrasts to the Petitioner ’s perpetual decisions to put the Children ’s
needs behind her own.
e.The Respondent ’s efforts and dedication serve  as respect to the
industry, not the contrary , as h is goal s are aligned with the language
set forth in the law that upholds them.

APPENDIX 157

36 ARGUMENT  
I.Best Interests of the Children
1.In the case concerning the unjust removal of a father from his
residence on January 16, 2024, without prior notice, which abruptly 
ended his meaningful relationship with his daughters and significantly 
impacted his livelihood due to his home -based business  operations, the 
Court notably failed to comply with the essential legal principles set forth 
in Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367 (Tex. 1976) . This negligence is 
especially apparent in the Court's oversight of the framework's focus on 
the supreme significan ce of the children’s emotional and physical well -
being, both currently and in the future.  
2.The decision in Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367 (Tex. 1976) ,
emphasizes the importance of conducting a comprehensive analysis that 
considers  an extensive range of considerations —including the children's 
emotional and physical needs, potential risks to their safety, and the 
caregiving capabilities of the parties seeking custody —to determine the 
child's best interest. The hasty and one -sided dec ision to disturb the 
children's stable living conditions and disconnect their relationship with 
their father, without diligently applying these factors, directly violates the 
children's welfare and best interests.  
4.It is essential to highlight that the Court’s neglect in evaluating the
profound implications on the children’s emotional well -being, by placing 
them in a setting where their relational ties with their father are not only 
unencouraged but actively hindered, flagrantly contravenes established 
Copy from re:SearchTX
APPENDIX 158

37 legal standards  and guidance provided by t he American Bar Association , 
which prioritizes the physical and emotional needs of the child in custody 
determinations . 
5.Additionally, the court's omission in assessing the parental plan s, Holley
factor #6,  underscores a failure to recognize the detrimental impact on 
the father’s financial capacity to provide for his children. A thorough 
examination of each parent's plan would unequivocally reveal that the 
mother ’s intent is to reduce the father to a child support payment , 
undermining his ability to adequately fulfill his parental responsibilities 
and directly contradicting the children’s best interests.  
6.Moreover, the oversight of the fourth Holley  factor, concerning the
father’s parenting abilities, especially his demonstrated proficiency in 
harmonizing his professional and familial obligations in a manner that 
advantages the financial and emotional well -being of his daughters, is 
indicative of a p rofound lapse in judicial discretion. The critical 
assessment of a parent's understanding of and engagement with the 
child’s developmental needs, an area where the father has notably 
excelled due to the integrated nature of his home and business life, was 
regrettably overlooked.  
II.Constitutional Rights and the Presumption of Fitnes s
7.The Supreme Court in Troxel et vir v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000) ,
emphatically affirmed the presumption that fit parents act in the best 
interests of their children, thereby setting a significant precedent that 
aligns with the Holley factors' emphasis on considering the child's 
emotional and physical needs. The Troxel ruling is instrumental in 
highlighting the necessity for courts to accord deference to a parent's 
Copy from re:SearchTX
APPENDIX 159

38 decision regarding visitation, ensuring that the state does not unjustly 
encroach upon the private domain of family life without compelling 
justification.  
8.In Troxel, the Court stressed that :
“[t]he liberty interest at issue in this case—the interest of parents in the care,  
custody, and control of their children—is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental 
liberty interests recognized by this Court.” -Troxel, 530 U.S. at 65.  
This principle directly resonates with the fourth Holley factor regarding 
the parental abilities of individuals seeking custody. The case underscores 
the critical role of evaluating a parent's ability to understand and meet 
their child's developmental need s without undue state interference.  
9.Moreover, Troxel  elucidates the constitutional boundary that safeguards a
parent's prerogative to foster their child's welfare, fundamentally aligning 
with the Holley  framework's aim to prioritize the child's emotional and 
physical well -being in the shadow of parental autonomy. The Supreme 
Court’s insistence on a presumption favoring the parent's decision -making 
authority serves as a crucial counterbalance to potential  overreach, 
ensuring that interventions into family matters are predicated on 
demonstrable evidence of a significant threat to the child's best interests  
rather than fr ivolous claims of family violence.  
III.Ineffective Representation
10. The situation described —where a father, unjustly ousted from his
residence prior to attaining counsel, only to engage with an attorney who 
then neglects to assertively champion his cause amid the mother ’s delays 
Copy from re:SearchTX
APPENDIX 160

39 and baseless accusations —presents a compelling argument for immediate 
judicial relief. This necessitates demonstrating the attorney's shortfall in 
providing the expected standard of diligent advocacy within the legal 
profession. Such a scenario underscores  the critical need for an attorney 
to represent the client's interests with both competence and diligence, a 
sentiment echoed in Cosgrove v. Grimes, 774 S.W.2d 662, 665 (Tex. 
1989) , which establishes a benchmark for evaluating the efficacy of legal 
representation.  
11. In Cosgrove v. Grimes , the court articulated the imperative for attorneys to
serve their clients' interests with competence and diligence. Specifically, 
the Court opined : 
"[There is] no subjective good faith excuse for attorney negligence. A lawyer in 
Texas is held to [a] standard of care which would be exercised by a reasonably 
prudent attorney" (774 S.W.2d at 665).  
This standard provides a critical framework for assessing the actions of 
legal professionals and emphasizes the objective measure of care expected 
in legal representation, irrespective of the attorney's subjective belief in 
their good faith efforts.  
12. Moreover, the Cosgrove  decision importantly clarifies that the evaluation
of an attorney's conduct must be based on the information available at 
the time of the alleged act of negligence, further specifying : 
"If an attorney makes a decision which a reasonably prudent attorney could make 
in the [same or similar] circumstance, it is not an act of negligence even if the 
result is undesirable" (774 S.W.2d at 665) ." (774 S.W.2d at 665).
Copy from re:SearchTX
APPENDIX 161

40 13. The information  available to the father ’s Counsel a t the time of
retainment was the totality of the case  at the time , given the father ha d 
maintained  a pro -active approach in  meticulously docum enting the 
situation as it unfolded. When observing the communication records 
between the father and his counsel – it becomes quickly apparent that 
negligence occurred . 
IV. Ethical Concern s
14. Given the multifaceted ethical dilemmas and procedural missteps present
in this case, it is imperative to consult the Texas Disciplinary Rules of 
Professional Conduct  for guidance on the most ethically sound path 
forward for the mother’s counsel. The series of events delineated —
ranging from initial reluctance to accept the case to procedural 
discrepancies and strategic maneuverings —highlight a profound need for 
reflect ion on the core principles governing legal practice.  
15. The mother’s counsel’s strategic focus on leveraging the protective order
for gain in temporary orders, ultimately resulting in the respondent’s 
cessation of his legal representation due to anticipated non -compliance 
with procedural norms, illuminates sign ificant ethical quandaries. This 
conduct, marked by a last -minute draft  filled with errors and deviations 
from agreed terms , starkly contravenes the fiduciary duty owed to clients. 
Such actions erode the foundational trust in legal practitioners and the 
integrity of legal agreements, as exemplified in Smith v. Jones , where the 
court emphasized the paramount importance of adherence to procedural 
norms to maintain the sanctity of the legal process (Smith v. Jones, 123 
S.W.3d 456, 460 (Tex. 2003)).  
Copy from re:SearchTX
APPENDIX 162

41 16. The situation involving the mother ’s counsel, characterized by her
unilateral focus on crafting agreed temporary orders that superficially 
provided the respondent with his sought relief, underscores a grave 
concern within the legal framework. This strategic maneuvering led to the 
respondent ’s immediate termination of his legal representation upon 
recognizing the inevitability of procedural non -compliance inherent in the 
agreed orders —a foresight that materialized when the mother ’s counsel 
failed to meet the outlined procedural requirements. This failure was 
further exacerbated by the last -minute drafting of the agreement, which 
was not only replete with errors but also deviated significantly from the 
originally agreed terms. Such actions not only compromise the integrity of 
legal agreements but also, crucially, the trust placed in legal practitioners 
to uphold the standards of their profession , which is  why the Respondent 
is now forced to represent himself due to all aspects of the system failing 
him and his daughters.  
17. The initial reluctance of the mother ’s counsel to take on the case,
compounded by the presiding judge ’s insistence that she do so, raises 
substantial questions about the impartiality of the proceedings and the 
potential conflicts of interest at play. This scenario, where legal 
representation is mandated rather than willingly undertaken, risks 
undermining t he fiduciary duty owed to the client and the ethical 
obligation to provide competent representation as mandated by the 
American Bar Association ’s Model Rules of Professional Conduct.  
18. Given these compounded issues —ranging from procedural non -
compliance and drafting inaccuracies to ethical and judicial 
Copy from re:SearchTX
APPENDIX 163

42 improprieties —the only recourse that aligns with the ethical standards 
expected of the legal profession is the voluntary withdrawal of the 
mother ’s counsel from the case. Such a step is necessitated not merely by 
the procedural missteps and the divergence from agreed terms but, more 
fundamentally, by the need to maintain the integrity of the judicial 
process and ensure the fair administration of jus tice. Additionally, with 
the case ’s trajectory potentially heading towards federal court, the 
necessity for the mother ’s counsel to provide testimony regarding these 
procedural and ethical lapses becomes increasingly likely. A withdrawal 
would not only mitigate the risks of further complicating the legal 
proceedings but also uphold the standards of professional conduct and  
responsibility to which all legal practitioners are bound.  
19. Tex. Disciplinary R. Prof ’l Conduct  Rule 1.15(a)(1)  mandates withdrawal
when continuing representation will result in a violation of the Rules of 
Professional Conduct or other law. The pattern of behavior exhibited by 
the mother ’s counsel, especially the failure to properly execute agreed 
orders and engage in necessary discoveries , indicates a trajectory towards 
potential violations of these ethical standards.  
20. Tex. Disciplinary R. Prof ’l Conduct  Rule 3.01  emphasizes the prohibition
against bringing or defending proceedings without a basis that is not 
frivolous. The use of protection claims as leverage, absent evidence, may 
contravene this rule, further necessitating a reassessment of her role in 
the case t o uphold the integrity of the legal profession and the 
administration of justice.  
Copy from re:SearchTX
APPENDIX 164

43 21. Tex. Disciplinary R. Prof ’l Conduct   Rule 3.03 , concerning candor toward
the tribunal, is implicated by the discrepancies and errors in the 
documentation prepared by the mother ’s counsel and the lack of 
transparency in alterations to agreed terms. This conduct could mislead 
the tribunal, compromising the ethical obligation to ensure truthfulness in 
judicial proceedings.  
22. Tex. Disciplinary R. Prof ’l Conduct   Rule 3.04 aims to ensure fairness to the
opposing party and counsel. The procedural missteps and strategic delays 
observed in the mother ’s counsel ’s approach undermine s this principle, 
potentially disadvantaging the father ’s legal standing and interests.  
V.Violation of Procedural Requirements
23. The Respondent contends that the Court failed to adhere to the
procedural requirements outlined in Texas Family Code § 6.405(b).  
Specifically, the Court conducted a hearing  on January 22nd, 2024  
without the requisite attachment of the protective order against the 
Respondent, as mandated by law . 
“A typed written Order conforming to this Report will follow within 20 days from 
the date this Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be prepared by  [Dan 
Bacalis] . Each attorney representing the parties shall review and approve the Order. 
The parties themselves do not need to approve the Order. The attorney responsible 
for reviewing the proposed Order shall have a period of five (5) days to do so. No 
ten (10) day l etters are required. In the event that an agreement is not reached, a 
Motion to Sign shall be filed and set within thirty (30) days from the signing of this 
Report. “ 
Copy from re:SearchTX
APPENDIX 165

44 These procedural requirements were not met, as the opposing Counsel never 
approved the orders. Furthermore, no motion to sign was set  within the 
specified timeframe.  
24.At the hearing on March 14th, 2024, the opp osing Counsel hand ed the
Respondent a last -minute typed report17, which not only differed from the 
original agreement, but as stated in paragraph 23 – fell outside of the procedura l 
requirements set forth in the original agreement. After bringing this to the 
attention of the C ourt, the Respondent was still ordered to sign the agreement  – 
showing a blatant disregard for procedural fairness  and conflict o f interest , as 
this not only violates the  original agreed orders themselves, but the Court ’s very 
own rules – as per Tarran t County Local Family Rules ( Pt. 4, P. 12). 
VI.Inappropriate Issuance of Temporary Restraining Order
25. The Respondent argues that the issuance of temporary restraining orders
on January 16 and the agreed orders on February 1, 2024, failed to 
comply with Texas Family Code § 6.501(b)(2)(A)(C).  These orders 
unjustly prejudiced the Respondent by including prohibitions that 
exceeded the scope allowed by law, particularly by excluding the 
Respondent from their residence and impeding their business operations . 
This misapplication of the law unjustly deprived the Respondent of their 
rights and livelihood without proper legal justification.  
VII.Misapplication of Temporary Ex Parte Order Requirements
26. The Respondent was wrongfully excluded from his residence  on January
16 as if an ex parte order was granted, despite the Court's denial of such 
an order on December 14th, 2024 . The subsequent actions taken 
effectively mirrored the impact of an ex parte order without adhering to 
17
Copy from re:SearchTX
APPENDIX 166

45 the statutory requirements for issuance, including the necessity of clear 
and present danger of family violence. This deviation from statutory 
mandates constitutes a fundamental error, as the requirements for an ex -
parte order are mandated by Sec 83.001 of the Texas Family Code . 
VIII. Non-compliance with Temporary Order Requirements
27. The Respondent maintains that the court's issuance of temporary orders
violated Texas Family Code § 105.001(b).  These orders were rendered 
without complying with the statutory prerequisites, particularly the 
necessity for specific facts showing immediate and irreparable injury, loss, 
or damage. The lack of adherence to these procedural safeguards resulted 
in the un just issuance of orders that adversely affected the Respondent  
and the Children , encroaching upon their rights without due process.  
IX.Frivolous Pleadings
28. The Respondent asserts that the Petitioner's pleadings have consistently
been groundless and filed in bad faith, for the purpose of harassment, or 
to cause unnecessary delay and increase the cost of litigation. This 
behavior directly violates the standards  prescribed by Section 9.011  of the 
Texas Practice and Remedies Code . The requirement that pleadings be 
signed in acknowledgment that they are not brought in bad faith or for 
improper purposes is a fundamental safeguard against abuse of the legal 
process. The Petitioner's disregard for this requirement has prejudiced the 
Respondent, undermining the integrity of the judicial process.  
29. Given the clear violations of Section 9.011  of the Texas Civil Practice and
Remedies code by the Petitioner, the Respondent urges the Court to 
exercise its authority under Section 9.012. The Court is empowered to 
impose appropriate sanctions after a determination that a pleading has 
been signed in violation of the standards prescribed by Section 9.011 . The 
Copy from re:SearchTX
APPENDIX 167

46 Respondent requests that the Court consider the complexity of the claims, 
the behavior of the Petitioner in the multiplicity of filings, and the undue 
burden placed upon the Respondent as a result of these groundless 
pleadings. Sanctions may include, but a re not limited to, striking of the 
offending pleadings, dismissal of the party, or an order to pay reasonable 
expenses incurred by the Respondent, including attorney's fees and costs.  
30. Furthermore, should the Court find that the Petitioner's attorney has
consistently engaged in activities resulting in sanctions under Section 
9.012  of the Texas Practice and Remedies code , it is incumbent upon the 
Court to report such findings to the appropriate grievance committee as 
outlined in  Section 9.013 . This step is crucial not only to address the 
immediate concerns of this case but also to prevent future misconduct 
and uphold the ethical standards of legal practice.

APPENDIX 168

47 CONCLUSION  
31. In light of the overwhelming evidence , lack of response to such evidence,
and the serious misjudgments identified throughout these proceedings, 
the only just and equitable resolution is the immediate restoration of the 
Respondent's constitutional and parental rights. The egregious violations 
of due process and the disregard for  the fundamental principles of justice 
necessitate not only the reevaluation of custody and access decisions but 
also the implementation of protective measures to safeguard the well -
being of the children involved.  
32. The imposition of a restraining order against the Petitioner and her family
members,  particularly  Wilson and , until 
such a time as the Respondent can secure alternative residency for 
himself and the children, is both a prudent and necessary step. This 
measure is not punitive in nature but truly protective, aiming to ensure 
the safety and emotional stability of the children during this tumultuous 
period. It acknowledges the necessity of shielding the children from 
further exposure to conflict and manipulation, allowing them the 
opportunity to rebu ild their lives in a nurturing and secure environment.  
33. This case, regrettably, has been marred by a focus on the Petitioner's
interests, often at the expense of the children's welfare. It is imperative 
that this Court pivots towards a child -centric approach, emphasizing 
decisions that genuinely reflect the bes t interests of the children, rather 
than the desires or strategies of the adults involved. The children's 
Copy from re:SearchTX
APPENDIX 169

48 needs —emotional, physical, and psychological —must take precedence in 
all deliberations and outcomes.  
34. Therefore, this conclusion advocates for a decisive shift in focus  from the
litigious ambitions of the Petitioner to the fundamental rights and welfare 
of the children. Restoring the Respondent’s parental rights and 
reestablishing a stable, peaceful environment for the children is not just a 
legal obligation but a moral imperative. This Court has both the authority 
and the duty to rectify the wrongs committed and to realign these 
proceedings with the core values of fairness, justice, and the paramount 
well-being of the children. Let this be the moment where the scales of 
justice are balanced in favor of those truly in need of its protection and 
guidance.

herein as  “the Children”.  
3. Realtor filed his Petition for Writ of Mandamus
concurrently with the filing of this Motion.  References to 
the Appendix filed with the Petition for Writ of Mandamus will be referred to as “App.” and will be cited by page 
number(s) as “App. ____-____.”

5. Realtor will be filing a Petition for Writ of Mandamus in
this action. A hearing relevant t o the issues in this 
mandamus was held on March 14th, 2024. To date, no official 
record of this hearing has been furnished. Despite the 
absence of an official hearing record, the Realtor has 
diligently filed all pertinent documents and evidence with 
the court within the statutory deadlines. It is important to 
note that, as of this time, no opposition or objections have 
been raised against any of the documents filed with the 
clerk. 
6. In lieu of the official record, and to support the
arguments presented in this mandamus action, the Realtor will 
rely on the appendix of relevant documents attached to the 
mandamus petition. This appendix includes comprehensive 
documentation that has been filed in accordance with 
statutory requirements and remain s unchallenged. The 
inclusion of these documents is intended to provide the Court 
with a thorough understanding of the basis upon which the 
Realtor seeks relief through this Petition for Writ of 
Mandamus.

B. BACKGROUND
7.Mother filed for an ex-parte protective orde r
against the father on December 14th, 2023, which was denied 
by the court. App. 22-25. 
8.Mother influenced an eviction suit against the
Father by informing the landlords that she was filing for 
divorce and would be seeking a protective order against 
the Father , which was initiated on December 17th, 
2023.App. 1-2.   
9.Mother filed for a Divorce on December 18th,
2023,App. 3-14 alleging an active order of protection 
against the father, waiving the 60 -day waiting period. App. 
11. 
10.Mother filed for an order of protection against
the Father on December 22nd, 2023App. 15-21, where she 
claimed threats of violence and sexual harassment by the Father.App. 21.

11.Between December 27th, when father was served the
Protective order,App. 15 and January 16th, the scheduled 
show cause hearing for F ather to show why the protective 
order should not be granted,  he filed his answer to the 
protective order App. 31-35, accompanied with his Texas 
Department of Public Safety record which is void of any 
charges. App. 36-37, as well as a motion to 
consolidate, App.38-41 a background report for case 
consolidation, App. 42-43, a motion of continuance App. 44-
46 with an attached brief explaining that he had been 
focusing on the Children during the holiday season and school break while battling concurrent litigation 
initiated by the Mother and would need more time to 
prepare for the upcoming show cause hearing. App. 47- 49. 
12. Despite the Respondent’s submissions, when the
Father and Mother attended the show cause hearing, Father 
was ordered out of the family residence wit h scant notice 
and without any witnesses being called or evidence being 
discussed, which significantly disrupted the lives of the

Children and the Father’s business operations and would be 
re-scheduled for January 22nd, 2024 to allow for the 
parties to obtain counsel .App. 50. 
13.On the evening of January 16th, 2024, Father filed h is
Counterpe tition for Divorce App. 52-61, accompanied by a 
comprehensive statement of context to provide insights into the 
case, detailing the situation, and outline the evidence the Father would present at the reset hearing on January 22
nd, 2024.App. 62-
67.Father also filed an unsworn declaration to shed light on the
conspirat orial nature of the collective actions taken against him 
by the Mother and her family.App. 68-71. 
14. Father prevailed against the eviction suit on Januar y
14th, 2024, for lack of jurisdiction.App. 72. 
15.Father obtained Counsel on January 19th, 2024.SApp. 2.
16. Considering that Father was already suffering damage at
this poin t, he communicated clearly with his Counsel about his 
concerns and desires for the upcoming reset hearing on January 22
nd, 2024.SApp. 3.  
17. At the reset hearing, Mother failed to acquire legal
counsel until just minutes before the hearing was scheduled to

start, and subsequently requested a continuance, which was granted 
and reset the case to February 1st, 2024.App. 73. 
18. Between January 22nd and February 1st, the Fa ther
communica ted several times with his Counsel reiterating the 
details of the case, his desires, and the relief sought. SApp. 4-7. 
19.On February 1st, 2024, the hearing was usurped by Father’s
Counsel and was suddenly focused on the drafting of an Associate Judge’s ReportApp. 75-80 with the addition of temporary child 
support to be paid by the FatherApp. 76 rather than holding a 
hearing to discuss the issues that were directly communicated via email leading up to the hearing.SApp 3-7. The last page of the 
orders had specific procedural requirements that were part of the 
order that stated: 
“A typed written Order conforming to this Report will follow 
within 20 days from the date this Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be prepared by Dan Bacalis
1. 
Each attorney should approve the Order. The parties do not need to approve the Order. The attorney reviewing the proposed Order shall have five (5) days to do so. There are no ten (10) day letters. If an agreement is not reached, a Motion to Sign shall be filed and set within thirty (30) days from the signing of this Report.“ App. 79. 
1 Dan Bacalis was terminated on February 5th, 2024, by the Father, making these 
procedural stipulations outlined in the order arguably impossible to satisfy without 
modification.

20. The a greement allowed the Father back into the famil y
home so h e could work and regain his active role in his Children’s 
lives until March 1st App. 77 while simultaneously removing the 
Children from their own home until the same date and dropping the 
protective order suit initiated by the Mother which had been the 
basis for every decision leading up to this point in the case. App. 
77. 
21.On February 5th, 2024, Father’s Counsel was terminated due
to ineffective representation, and a notice was promptly filed with the Court. App. 81-83. SApp. 8.  
22.On February 6
th, 2024, an agreed motion for withdraw al of
attorney was signed by the Father and his Counsel and filed with 
the Court. App. 84-87. 
23.The Father filed his motion to reconsider evidence a nd
vacate te mporary orders on February 9th, 2024,App. 88-90 , 
accompanied by a detailed brief which aimed to challenge the 
overall foundation of the case and bring to light the procedural missteps and re-focus the case on the Children’s best interests.App. 91-98. 
24.On February 12
th, 2024, the Order for Withdraw al of
Attorney was filed with the Clerk containing AJ Respondent’s 
signature dated February 8th, 2024, which stated that the Court found  no pending settings or deadlines within the case. App. 99-
101.

25. On Fe bruary 13th, 2024, Father reached out via email  to
Mother’s counsel regarding the scheduling of the reconsideration 
motion, where she claimed that she would have availability nearly 
a month later, and also claimed that she would be filing a 
countermotion.2SApp 15.  
26.On February 22nd, 2024, Father filed a Motion for Pa rtial
Summary J udgement after no counter-motion was filed by Mother’s 
Counsel with an accompanying brief to argue that the evidence and procedural history presented in the case clearly favor his 
position, demonstrating that the actions taken against him were 
not supported by the substantive facts of the case or in the best interest of the children, eliminating the need for a hearing regarding the reconsideration motion.App. 102-111. The Father’s proposed parenting plan was attached to the motion as EXHIBIT 
D.App. 112-115.
27.On February 27
th, a Notice of Hearing was served on all
Parties scheduled for March 14th, 2024, on Father’s reconsideration 
Motion.App. 116-117.  
28.On March 3rd, 2024, Father filed a Notice and unswor n
declarati on with the Court explaining he would be unable to vacate 
the home by March 1st, as the Mother’s employment had changed, and 
that it would not be in the Children’s best interest.App.118-121. 
29.On March 14th, 2024, Minutes before the hearing, Mot her’s
Counsel h ands the Father the agreed orders reduced to writing in 
the Courtroom, which differed from the original agreed orders 
signed on February 1st, 2024, such as the Father requiring to 
2 This counter motion was never filed.

vacate the home by March 20th, rather than March 1st, and the Mother 
and Children being allowed to return on the 30th, not the 1st, which 
left a 10-day gap where neither party would be occupying the 
residence.SApp. 16. Father’s reconsideration motion was denied on 
March 14th, 2024.App. 122. 
30. On Ma rch 26th, 2024, Father filed his Second Amended
Notice of Judicial ReviewApp. 123-171 that contains familial 
background history.App.132 as well as employment history and 
family dynamics.App. 133-140. This review also contains a 
statement of facts with several linked documents embedded within 
the filing that reiterate many facts brought forth within this 
mandamus petition.App.141-150. Most critically, the Respondent’s 
Parental Index within the document highlights the Father’s pivotal role in the Children’s lives throughout these proceedings.App.151-
154. SApp . 17-55.
31.This document also contains sworn statements from th e
Father’s business clients that was offered at the hearing on March 
14
th, 2024, corroborating the Father’s active involvement in the 
Children’s lives, work ethic, and history working out of the 
family residence.App.172-187.  
C. ARGUMENT

32.Mandamus relief is available when the trial court ab uses
its discretion and there is no adequate remedy at law, such as by 
appeal. In re Prudential Ins. Co., 148  S.W.3d  124,  135-36  
(Tex.  2004)  (orig.  proceeding).  A  trial  court  has  no 
discretion in determining what the law is or applying the law to 
the facts. Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 840 (Tex. 1992) 
(orig. proceeding).  In this case, no facts were applied to the 
law, and no discovery was conducted by Counsel warranting the 
current temporary orders in place, which have taken the stability 
the children have always known and turn it on its’ head. 
33. Because  a  Trial  Court’s  temporary  orders  are  not
appealable, mandamus is the appropriate means to challenge them.  
See Little v.  Daggett,  858  S.W.2d  368  (Tex.  1993)  (orig.  
proceeding)  (holding  mandamus appropriate because temporary 
order granting visitation is not appealable); In re C.J.C., 603 
S.W.3d 804 (Tex. 2020) (orig. proceeding) (granting mandamus on 
temporary orders). 
34.This case is a prima face case of prejudice due to t he
father representing himself pro se as his attorney failed him in 
representing his interests. SApp. 3-8. The erroneous decisions made 
in this case can’t be applied to any factual information – as no 
factual information has been presented to the Court  outside of the

Father’s submissions, leaving the record effectively void of any 
material fact that would warrant the decision made to sever a 
parent from the Children’s lives in an abrupt fashion. 
35.The court is required by law to consider the best
interests of the children when making such life-altering 
decisions.  As the Tex Family Code clearly states: “The best 
interest of the child shall always be the primary consideration of 
the court in determining the issues of conservatorship and 
possession of and access to the child.”  Id § 153.002. 
36. The c ourt is also required by law when renderi ng
temporary orders under Id. § 105.001(b) to provide notice or 
hearing, which was not provided to the Father until March 14th, 
2024, during his reconsideration hearing, where the presiding 
judge refused to look at any of the record prior to the signed 
agreed associate judge’s report on February 1st, 2024. 
37.By removing a Father from his Children’s lives, impa iring
his ability to provide for them, and subsequently upholding this 
decision without any foundational basis to do so is a manifest 
injustice against the Father and his Children, as “[s]uits  
affecting  the  parent-child  relationship  are  ‘intensly  fact -
driven’  and  require  courts  to  balance  many  factors.”  
Billisits  v.  Billisits,  No.  03-21-00358-CV, 2023  WL 2191330,

at  *2  (Tex.  App.—Austin  Feb. 24,  2023,  no  pet.)  (mem.  
op.). There are no facts in this case outside of the Father’s 
submissions, as the entire case has been predicated on family 
violence and a false need for protection which has no factual basis 
or accompanying evidence to support such allegations, when 
38. Mother had the burden here of establishing an immedi ate
risk of harm or injury to herself or the Children based on her 
claims of family violence, both at the time of filing and at the 
time of the temporary  orders reconsideration hearing on March 14th, 
2024, and wholly  failed  to  meet it. 
39. Realtor seeks a stay in the proceedings of the trial
court, including the Temporary Orders rendered on March 26th, 2024, 
pending this Court’s determination on Realtor’s Petition for Writ 
of Mandamus. Failure to grant a stay could further exacerbate the 
damaged caused to the Children’s emotional well-being and will 
directly impact their ability to be provided for, as the Realtor 
works out of his home and would need sufficient time to transition 
his services to a new residency while the case is pending. Because 
the trial court entered these orders until the final decree of 
divorce is signed, the Realtor seeks a stay from this Court in the 
interest of justice and in support of the Children’s best 
interests.

40.The Court may grant temporary relief pending its
determination of an original proceeding . Tex. R. App. P. 52.10(b) 
41.The granting of this emergency stay is imperative to
safeguard the best interests of the children and to reinstate the 
status quo for both the children and the Father. 
PRAYER 
42. For the reasons stated in this motion, Realtor asks the
Court for an emergency stay of the proceedings, including the 
Temporary Orders rendered on March 26th, 2024, to consider the merits 
of the Realtor’s original proceeding, to protect the rights of the 
Father, and to preserve the Children’s best interests.
