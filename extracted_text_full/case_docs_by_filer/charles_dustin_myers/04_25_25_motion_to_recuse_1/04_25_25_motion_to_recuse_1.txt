 TO THE HONORABLE DAVID L. EV ANS OF THE 8TH ADMINISTRATIVE 
JUDICIAL REGION OF TEXAS:   
This Court's impartiality is now irrevocably in question.  The act of 
setting this case for final trial after sustaining over a year of irreparable harm while 
appellate proceedings remain unresolved is itself an act of partiality warranting 
mandatory recusal pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 18 b(b)(1) and 18b(b)(2) on the 
grounds that the partiality of the tribunal is reasonably in question, and there is a 
clear personal bias and prejudice exhibited towards the undersigned.  
I. TIMELINESS  
The timeliness of this motion comes three days before a scheduled court 
proceeding,  which is intended to “set the case for final trial and to enter a pre -trial 
scheduling order”. (TAB A) However, this flies in the face of three concurrent 
mandamus proceedings pending before the Second Court of Appeals, which 
concurrently seek redress for 1) the refusal of Hon. Kate Stone to hear a properly filed emergency TRO ( No. 02 -25-00164 -CV), to seek vacatur of the orders issued 
beyond the court’s jurisdiction by Hon. Jeff Kaitcer on March 14, 2024 ( No. 02 -25-
00166- CV), (TAB B)  and to reverse an improper consolidation motion granted sua 
sponte by Hon. Kenneth Newell. (No. 02 -25-00171 -CV) All three mandamus 
petitions are at the en banc rehearing stage, except for cause number 02- 25-00166 -
CV which was denied per curiam on April 24, 2024 .

6 
 Despite the upcoming setting, the exception pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 
18a(b)(1)(B)(i) applies. The act of scheduling this matter for final trial itself 
constitutes grounds for recusal by casting doubt upon the tribunal's impartiality. 
The undersigned cou ld not have anticipated that this final trial setting would 
suddenly arise amidst ongoing appellate proceedings, especially given that the case has remained inactive since September of 2024.  
Significantly, the opposing party has only recently re -engaged with the case 
after emergency relief was requested by the undersigned in the 233rd District Court due to the continuing harm inflicted upon him and his children by these unresolved issues. Thus, this abrupt effort to proceed with final trial under the prevailing 
circumstances starkly demonstrates judicial bias, further reinforcing the necessity 
of recusal at this juncture . 
II. PRIOR RECUSAL  
The undersigned must also note that this marks the second recusal motion 
filed in this case, the first occurring on October 7, 2024, which  was denied on 
November 7, 2024, by visiting retiring Justice Gabriel. (TAB C) The motion was 
denied stating a “failure to appear”, however, all parties agreed to reset the case to a later due to a dental emergency sustained by the undersigned. (TAB D) There was 
no mention of this emergency in the order. Finally, it wasn’t until over four months 
later that the judges were reinstated back into the case, because the undersigned

7 
 had to remind the court coordinator when seeking a ruling on his still un- opposed 
summary judgement that’s been on the docket since February 22, 2024,  to reinstate 
Hon. Munford and Hon. Kaitcer. (TAB E) Had the undersigned not proactively 
reached out, there was n’t any indication that the reinstatement would have 
occurred.  
III. PROCEDURE  
 The correct procedural framework required in these proceedings, particularly 
considering the irregular handling of prior matters, must be restated here:  
First , pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(e)(1), “…the clerk of the court must 
immediately deliver a copy to the respondent judge and to the presiding judge of 
the administrative judicial region in which the court is located.” Therefore, the 
undersigned formally objects to any handling from the court coordinator 
regarding these proceedings. In the prior matter there were amended referrals, 
modified pleadings , and an otherwise straightforward process became ambiguous.  
(TAB F) 
Second, pursuant to Id. 18a(e)(2): “[w]hen a respondent judge signs and 
files an order of recusal or referral, the clerk of the court must immediately deliver 
a copy to the regional presiding judge.” The same applies  here as to point one. No 
disrespect is intended; this assertion is made solely insofar as the governing statute 
confers no such authority to court coordinators.

8 
  Third , pursuant to Id.  18a(g)(6)(C), the undersigned respectfully requests 
that this matter be set for hearing by telephone at the earliest practicable time, 
considering the undersigned’s current financial hardship and lack of stable 
residence.  The nature and complexity of the underlying issues are not easily 
reducible to writing, which is precisely why this matter has suffered from 
prolonged procedural silence rather than meaningful discussion grounded in the record. A telephonic hearing is nece ssary to afford the Court a clearer 
understanding of the facts and to ensure due process is meaningfully observed.  
Fourth, should this motion be granted, the undersigned respectfully requests 
that this case be reassigned to an entirely different judicial district, given that both 
the 233rd and 322nd District Courts are presided over by judges directly 
implicated in the proce dural and constitutional irregularities described herein.  
Fifth, if the Honorable Regional Presiding Judge chooses to refer t his 
motion , the undersigned requests that the alternative language of Id.18a(g)(1 ) be 
exercised so that the motion may be referred to the Chief Justice of the Supreme 
Court of Texas given the circumstances of this matter, as explained in more detail 
below.  
Finally , pursuant to Id. 18a(f)(1)(A), the undersigned respectfully urges the 
Honorable James B. Munford to voluntarily recuse himself in order to avoid further delay and to restore confidence in the fair and impartial administration of

9 
 justice , or in the alternative , vacate the March 14, 2024 orders for want of 
consen t, and set cause number #322- 744263 -23 for a pre -trial conference no 
later than 14- days from the decision,  effectively  rendering moot these recusal 
proceeding.  
The persistent and unexplained judicial inaction —particularly in the face of 
repeated requests for emergency relief —has caused ongoing, irreparable harm to 
the undersigned and his minor children. Such circumstances are fundamentally 
incompatible with both the due process protections guaranteed by law and the best 
interest standard governing all family law proceedings in this State.  There is no 
logic in proceeding to final trial in the current circumstance. One party cannot 
unilaterally decide the matter, especially when they remain silent in the face of serious, un -rebutted allegations.   
IV . GROUNDS FOR RECUSAL  
A. STANDARD FOR RECUSAL  
A motion to recuse is the appropriate procedural mechanism to challenge a 
judge’s impartiality. Sanchez v. State , 926 S.W.2d 391, 394 (Tex. App. —El Paso 
1996, pet. ref’d). Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(a) , any party may file 
a verified motion stating with particularity the grounds upon which the presiding judge should not sit.

10 
 In addition to the statutory bases for recusal, the Due Process Clause of the 
Fourteenth Amendment provides an independent constitutional floor: recusal is 
required where the probability of actual bias is too high to be constitutionally 
tolerable. Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co. , 556 U.S. 868, 872 (2009) (citing 
Withrow v. Larkin , 421 U.S. 35, 47 (1975)). That standard is met where, under the 
totality of circumstances, a judge’s continued participation creates an unacceptable 
risk of bias—whether due to pr ior involvement, one -sided procedures, or 
unchecked discretion applied to the detriment of one party.  
Here, the cumulative record demonstrates a pattern of prejudice,  one-sided 
decision -making, and disregard for both procedure and fundamental rights, rising 
well beyond the constitutional threshold described in Caperton. Recusal is not merely appropriate —it is required , as explained below . 
B. BIAS  
The level of bias against the undersigned started on day one . Without any 
factual basis, without holding an evidentiary hearing, and without eliciting any 
testimony from the Petitioner, the undersigned was ordered to vacate the residence 
that same day. (TAB F) No protective order was ever issued, no findings of family 
violence were made, even though Tex. Fam. Code §§ 83.006 and 85.001 plainly require such findings.

11 
 This decision , even though temporarily, severed the parent -child relationship 
without any lawful basis. The Family Code’s strict requirements were ignored. Tex. 
Fam. Code § 83.006(a) permits exclusion of a party from the home only if (1) the 
applicant files an affidavit  describing facts requiring exclusion, and (2) appears at 
the hearing to testify to  those facts. Section 83.006(b) further requires that the court 
make three findings: (i) the applicant resides (or recently resided) at the premises, 
(ii) the other party committed family violence within the past 30 days, and (iii) 
there is a clear and pre sent danger of future family violence.  
The only thing before the court were allegations  of family violence, which 
were never substantiated. Rather, they were leveraged into a settlement agreement that removed the children from their own home  in February of 2024.  (TAB G) A 
court cannot sever a parent -child bond on mere allegations . Tex. Fam Code 
153.002.  Yet here, that’s what has occurred, and the undersigned has sought 
answers from this court –  and has received nothing but complete silence.  
Now, over fourteen months later, a facially invalid consent judgement has 
been permitted to destroy the lives of not only the undersigned –  but his children, 
all while enabling the Petitioner, MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS, to get away 
with her deliberate scheme to undermine the judiciary that remains un- opposed on 
the face of the record.  A cursory glance at page 1 versus page 38 of an excerpt of

12 
 these orders reveals this defect. (TAB B.1 “The parties have agreed to the terms of 
this order as evidenced by the signatures below ”)   
In essence, Hon. James Munford’s initial decision to oust a father from his 
own home was unlawful  and instead of explain his decision or support it with legal 
authority, he has chosen to ignore it and now moves to set the matter for final trial 
in the midst of the undersigned’s attempt to seek relief from a fraudulent consent judgement where only one -half of the parties signature s appear.  (TAB B.10) This is 
not just prejudicial;  this is such a significant level of deliberate bias that it must be 
reconciled  through recusal . The court cannot just sit on its’ hands and wait for the 
undersigned to exhaust his appeal efforts  after depriving him unlawfully of his core 
interests  protected by the  
Moreover, the substantive  aspect of due process was violated. There is a 
“strong presumption that the best interest of a child is served by remaining with a 
fit parent.” Troxe l v. Granville , 530 U.S. at 68- 69. The government may not 
“infringe on the fundamental right of parents to make child rearing decisions 
simply because a state judge believes a ‘better decision’ could be made .” Id. at 
72 (plurality op.). In the absence of any evidence or finding that Respondent was 
an unfit or dangerous parent, removing his children from him was an arbitrary 
infringement on his fundamental liberty interest . The orders entered in this case 
prioritized a one -sided allegation over a father’s constitutional rights, in a manner

13 
 repugnant to both the Texas and U.S. Constitutions , which  guarantee  that no citizen 
shall be deprived of liberty or property except by the due course of the law of the 
land. Here, Respondent was deprived of liberty  and property interests  without 
lawful procedures or any adjudication of wrongdoing, in violation these 
fundamental protections. U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1 . Further, no equal 
protection or due course of law has been afforded to the undersigned, 
demonstrating further unexplained bias, in violation of Tex. Const. art. I, §§ 3, 19.  
C. PREJUDICIAL DOCKET MANAGEMENT  
A court has the inherent authority to control its own docket. See Ho v. 
University of Texas at Arlington , 984 S.W.2d 672, 694- 95 (Tex.App. -Amarillo 
1998, pet. denied) Whether a reasonable period has lapsed in which to rule on a 
pending matter is dependent on the circumstances of each case.  Ex parte Bates , 65 
S.W.3d 133, 134- 35 (Tex. App. —Amarillo  2001, orig. proceeding).  Other factors 
considered in determining whether a reasonable time has passed are the state of  the 
trial court's docket and other judicial and administrative duties that must be 
addressed.  In re Villarreal,  96 S.W.3d 708, 711 (Tex. App. —Amarillo  2003, orig. 
proceeding).  
Here, in this matter, the undersigned has dispositive motions on the docket 
that would afford him the much -needed  relief, yet the court chooses to prioritize 
motions that favor the opposition. For example, the oldest sitting motion is a

14 
 Motion for Summary Judgement filed on Feb 22, 2024, seeking to defeat the 
baseless claims of violence that were raised him at the onset of this case .  
Next, there exists a pending Rule 12 Motion challenging COOPER L. 
CARTER’s authority, counsel for Petitioner in this matter. Despite this, she 
interrupted emergency proceedings in the 233rd District Court, leading to the 
mandamus proceedings that neither the tribunal nor opposing side has participated 
in, but continues to act sua sponte to give the illusion of an adequate remedy for an 
appeal  when the threshold issues remain.  
Finally, there exists a pending DWOP motion and motion to compel 
discovery on the docket, pending for several months –  unaddressed  – showing no 
respect for the process by the opposing side . In In re Conner, 458 S.W.3d 532 (Tex. 
2015) the Texas Supreme Court’s statement that "conclusive presumption of 
abandonment" that arises from unexplained delays indicates that judges must 
actively manage their dockets to prevent such delays or ensure that they are 
adequately explained. Here, there is no explanation for t he delays and inaction. The 
opposition has no incentive to move the case forward, as they were awarded on all 
core issues at the onset of the case –  for reasons yet to be explained.   
The only party seeking any form of relief has been the undersigned.  
Authorities not only establish judicial responsibility for docket management but 
also provide examples of judges proactively fulfilling this responsibility rather than

15 
 blaming litigants for delays. The actions of the Galveston County district judges 
described in Armentrout v. Murdock , 779 S.W.2d 119 (Tex. App.  
1989) and Southern Pacific Transp. Co. v. Stoot , 530 S.W.2d 930 (Tex. 
1975) exemplify this approach. These judges "recognized this problem, took 
responsibility for the condition of their dockets, and moved against the troubles of delay" by instituting systems to ensure timely case progression. This example demonstrates that effective judges take ownership of their dockets rather than 
deflecting res ponsibility.  
The responsibility of judges for docket management is further emphasized 
by the accountability measures in place.  In re Rose , 144 S.W.3d 661 (Tex. 
2004) demonstrates that judges can face disciplinary action for administrative 
misconduct, including failures related to court management. Judge Rose's own acknowledgment that "the responsibility is mine" and "I'm the bottom line" re flects 
the understanding within the judiciary itself that judges bear ultimate responsibility 
for their courts' functioning.  
A plea to the jurisdiction has been filed as of April 24, 2025, to serve as 
another reminder to the court that these orders must be vacated as a matter of law, not finalized into finality. (TAB H)  
D. FA VORITISM TOWARD OPPOSING COUNSEL

16 
 The record in this case reveals a sustained pattern of judicial favoritism 
toward opposing counsel, warranting recusal. In Sun Exploration & Production 
Co. v. Jackson , 783 S.W.2d 202, 204 (Tex. 1989), the Texas Supreme Court 
acknowledged that while individual rulings may not rise to the level of reversible error, an appellate court may nonetheless detect from the record a clear pattern of 
favoritism that undermines the  appearance of impartiality.  
Recusal is required where such favoritism would cause a reasonable 
observer to doubt the judge’s neutrality. Here the level of favoritism is so high that 
the courts below improperly grant motions sua -sponte without hearings to the 
Petitioner’s benefit, when the same is done to the undersigned to his detriment. As 
the court explained in Guillen v. Cameron County , No. 13 -16-00682 -CV (Tex. 
App. —Corpus Christi –Edinburg Nov. 15, 2018, no pet.):  
“Recusal is appropriate if a reasonable member of the public at large, 
knowing all the facts in the public domain concerning the judge’s conduct, would harbor doubts as to the judge’s impartiality.”  That standard is met here. An 
objective observer reviewing the docket would see:  
i. A mother who conducted a deliberate scheme to defraud the judiciary and pursue an extramarital affair;  
ii. A father ordered out of his home and children’s daily lives without any findings or evidentiary hearing;

17 
 iii. A consistent pattern of orders favoring one party while leaving the pro se 
litigant’s motions unresolved;  
iv. Multiple appellate filings by the undersigned that went entirely unopposed by opposing counsel and yet still resulted in no relief;  
v. No findings of fact, no evidentiary hearings, no sworn testimony—despite extraordinary relief being granted to the opposing party;  
vi. An attorney of record who has failed to prosecute her claims in accordance 
with Rule 165a or respond to critical motions—yet continues to receive the 
benefit of judicial action;  
vii. Five appellate proceedings where no Respondent judge provided any input 
or argument;  
viii. And a series of sua sponte orders, issued in her favor, without proper notice, hearing, or adversarial testing.  
These facts are not merely irregular —they reflect a judicial posture that appears 
to favor silence over substance and one party’s procedural neglect over the other’s persistent legal effort.  It chooses to separate parent and child rather than uphold the 
State’s policy pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code 153.001.  
Accordingly, the undersigned objects to any participation from opposing 
counsel in any forthcoming telephonic or evidentiary hearing unless and until she 
submits a formal response addressing the allegations raised in this motion. To

18 
 remain silent in briefing, only to appear at hearing and object, is both prejudicial 
and professionally improper. Such conduct should not be condoned by the Court, 
particularly when it operates to the detriment of a self- represented parent seeking 
long- delayed relief.   
CONCLUSION  
 Imagine being labeled a criminal —accused of abuse —while a court is told 
that a protective order already exists against you.  Imagine that the very person you 
supported for years  and who benefitted from your success suddenly claims 
financial indigence, asserts full responsibility for all expenses, and serves you—at 
Christmas—with allegations designed to remove you from your home, your 
children, and your livelihood.  Now imagine this: You built a business from home—
intentionally, strategically —so that you coul d raise your children and be a present 
father, not just a provider. You tailored your entire life around being there for them.  
Now imagine the State —without lawful authority —rips that life away.  No 
hearing. No findings. No emergency. No evidence.  And then the State does 
nothing. It sits on its hands while you fight, alone, for over fifteen months —
pleading for relief, receiving only silence . And the reason? There isn’t one that 
can be traced to the record, meaning it must be extrajudicial and derived from 
actual bias. There exists no basis for the current orders to remain in effect, yet they 
are. The court chooses to act sua sponte only when it benefits the opposing party.

19 
 In a world where you take the initiative of showing up, ready to defend 
yourself—your family, your home, your rights —only for those rights  to be stripped 
away in the blink of an eye before being afforded the chance to defend yourself. 
No process. No fairness. No law.   
Is that how justice works? Is that how a divorce should begin? Because that 
is exactly what happened here . This is more than a denial of due process. This is 
a system abandoning its core duty to protect children and uphold the law.  This 
is a constitutional wound —one that continues to bleed with every day this court 
refuses to act.  This recusal must be granted as a matter of law —not just to restore 
fairness, but to prevent this travesty from becoming permanent.  Each day this 
continues is another day of unexplained, avoidable suffering inflicted on the 
children at the center of this case  while the opposing side sits in silence.  The court 
has an obligation to conduct their operations within the bounds of the law and protect the family unit. Here, this court took no issue in destroying it from the onset.  
Therefore, notwithstanding the docket management and favoritism displa yed 
towards the opposing party, the pattern of rulings alone showcases  a deep -seated 
favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible . Dow Chem. 
Co v Francis, 46 S.W.3d 237, 240 (Tex 2001) (per curiam); In re CJO , 325 S.W.3d

20 
 261, 267 (Tex App- Eastland 2010, pet denied). Therefore, recusal is warranted in 
this situation.  
This absurdity must be  put to an end or  lawfully justified.  
PRAYER FOR RELIEF  
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, the undersigned respectfully requests 
the following:  
1. If the Honorable James B. Munford declines to voluntarily recuse 
himself , the Court shall set this matter for a telephonic hearing at the 
earliest practicable time  pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(g)(6)(C);  
2. If the Regional Presiding Judge refers this motion, the undersigned respectfully requests that it be escalated to the Chief Justice of the 
Supreme Court of Texas, pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(g)(1), in light of 
the extraordinary circumstances and the appearance of structural bias 
throughout the proceedings;  
3. Pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(g)(4), the undersigned urgently requests that 
the Court issue interim orders restoring the undersigned’s fundamental right to property, his liberty interest in his children, and his right to conduct the normal operation of his business  until such time as valid 
orders can be lawfully entered by an impartial tribunal; and that the Court vacate the March 14, 2024 “agreed” temporary orders , as they were

21 
 entered without consent, without findings, and in excess of the court’s  
jurisdiction;  
4. Take judicial notice  that all relief sought herein remains unopposed on the 
record, and that the opposing party has, by her own silence, waived any 
right to rebut this relief at this juncture;  
5. Grant such other and further relief— at law or in equity —as the Court 
deems just and proper under the circumstances.  
 
 
 
Respectfully submitted,

Subject:  RE: Today's hearing at 11 CL-12105
Dear Ms. Baker, and Mr. Carter,
I am writing to respectfully request a rescheduling of today’s recusal hearing due to an unexpected medical issue. Late
last night, I began experiencing severe tooth pain, which has now escalated to significant facial swelling and intense
discomfort. The pain is currently affecting my ability to speak, eat, and focus, making it challenging to fully participate in
today’s proceedings.
Specifically, it's my bottom left molar which the nerve is open and exposed causing significant pain.  
I want to sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, especially given the efforts the court has made to
accommodate this hearing. Please know that this request is made only out of necessity, and I deeply regret the timing as
I would prefer to move the case forward.
This request comes with a high degree of reluctance given the unexpected technical difficulties experienced last time and
would not be making it if it wasn't absolutely necessary.
Thank you all for your understanding and consideration. I am committed to continuing with the hearing at the earliest
possible opportunity as I am eager to move the case forward.
I wanted to inform the court as soon as possible out of respect for the courts busy schedule.
I currently am unable to locate the case on research texas, as I've been trying to file a formal notice but given the time I
wanted to ensure the court was made aware as soon as possible of the situation.
Lines of communication are open for further discussion or if any further information is needed.
With respect,
Charles Myers

NO. 322-744263-23 
IN THE 322nd DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY , TEXAS  
TO THE HONORABLE JAMES MUNFORD: 
The record reveals a pattern of the Court acting beyond its jurisdiction: on January 16, 
2024 , the Court ousted Respondent from the marital residence withou t any fin d ing of  fam ily 
violence or  protective order; on March 26, 2024, the C ourt entered “Agreed” Temporary 
Orders without R espondent’s c onsent , flouting the statutory procedures for entry of such 
orders. These actions violate Respondent’s due proc ess rights an d the Texas Family C ode. U nder 
Texas la w, or der s issued without j urisdiction  or in the absence of  a party’s consent are void 
and cannot confer jurisdiction. Respondent asks the Court to recogni ze these fundamental de fects 
and dismi ss the cur rent orders a s a m atter of  law. 
Until the se orders are resolved , or the court issues w ritt en find ings rega r ding their 
legitim acy, Responde nt will not  appea r and  risk further deprivation  of hi s right s from this court. IN THE INTEREST OF M.E.M., C.R.M., two

I.INTRODUCTION
Petitioner filed a divorce petition under Title 5 of the Texas Family Code on December 
18, 2023. That petition did not seek exclusive possession of the residence or ask that Respondent 
be excluded from the home. Shortly thereafter, on December 22, 2023, Pet itioner filed a separate 
Application for Protective Order  under Title 4 of the Family Code, in which she explicitly 
requested exclusive possession of the home, removal of Respondent, and child support. The Court consolidated the protective‐order case into the divorce case.  
On January 16, 2024, the court—without holding an evidentiary hearing or finding family 
violence—entered Temporary Orders granting Petitioner exclusive possession of the home and primary custody and child support, and requiring Respondent to vacate the res idence that same 
day. No protective order was ever issued and no findings of family violence were made, even though Tex. Fam. Code §§ 83.006 and 85.001 plainly require such findings. In the weeks that followed, the court continued these arrangements and ul timately entered “Agreed” Temporary 
Orders (March 26, 2024) allocating parenting time and support. All of these extreme orders were based solely on Petitioner’s Title 4 application (and allegations of family violence), and no amendments to the pleadings we re ever filed to convert the case into a Title 5 SAPCR. 
Respondent never received any notice or hearing on custody, possession, or support issues under Title 5.  
II. Legal Standards
The trial court’s authority is strictly limited by the statutes and pleadings. It may consider 
only the claims and relief expressly pleaded by the parties, and must follow the Family Code’s procedures for protective orders and SAPCRs. Subject‐matter jurisd iction is a threshold issue: if

the court acted beyond the law, its orders are void. A plea to the jurisdiction is decided as a 
matter of law when the relevant facts are undisputed (see Tex. Dep’t of Parks & Wildlife v. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d 217, 228 (Tex. 2004)). Here, the material jurisdictional facts are not in dispute.  
III. Title 4 (Protective Order) Proceedings Cannot Support Custody or Support  
Under Texas law, a protective‐order proceeding (Title 4) is not  a custody (SAPCR) 
proceeding (Title 5). The San Antonio Court of Appeals recently reaffirmed that without a proper SAPCR petition under Title 5, a court may not award conservatorship, possession, or support. In Rivera v. Figueroa (Tex. App.–San Antonio 2019), the court held that orders issued in a protective‐order case cannot support conservatorship or child‐support relief unless a Title 5 petition was filed and noticed. Likewise, In re Sheffie ld, 639 S.W.2d 270 (Tex. App.–Dallas 
1982), long held that Title 4 and Title 5 proceedings are jurisdictionally separate: “a court may not grant relief beyond the scope of the protective‐order statute without compliance with the SAPCR statutes” (sheffield, 6 39 S.W.2d at 272- 73). Here, Petitioner’s December 22 Title 4 
application was never amended or converted into a Title 5 petition. Respondent never waived notice or a hearing on conservatorship/possession issues. The court’s decision to exclude Respondent from the home and divest him of custody on January 16, 2024 therefore had no 
jurisdictional basis. In short, “[w]ithout a valid protective order in place, the court lacked 
jurisdiction to continue enforcing the extreme relief originally granted”.  
IV . Statutory Prerequisites for Exclusion and Protective Orders Were Not Met  
Even if the court treated the relief as a protective‐order, the Family Code’s strict 
requirements were ignored. Tex. Fam. Code § 83.006(a) permits exclusion of a party from the

home only  if (1) the applicant files a sworn affidavit describing facts requiring exclusion, and (2) 
appears at the hearing to testify on those facts. Section 83.006(b) further requires that the court 
make three findings: (i) the applicant resides (or recently resi ded) at the premises, (ii) the other 
party committed family violence within the past 30 days, and (iii) there is a clear and present danger of future family violence. Likewise, § 85.001(a) mandates that at the close of a protective‐order hearing, the court must explicitly find whether family violence occurred. If so, 
the court “ shall ” issue a protective order against the perpetrator. In this case, none of these 
prerequisites were satisfied. Petitioner did file an application and affidavit, but no hearing on January 16 (or thereafter) produced any finding of family violence. The court did not issue a protective order as the statute requires, and instead simply extended the eviction and custody restrictions indefinitely. By failing to hold a hearing, make any family‐violence finding, or enter a protective order, the court “bypass[ed] the statutory prerequisites” entirely. Without those statutorily required findings, the January 16 “kick‐out” and custody order was outside the court’s 
power. 
V . All Orders Exceeding the Pleadings or Statutory Authority Are Void
It is a bedrock rule that a Texas court must confine its rulings to the relief requested by 
the pleadings and authorized by statute. Any order beyond that scope is void. The Houston First 
Court of Appeals has stated that “[a]n order purporting to grant relief beyond the pleadings is void ab initio”. In Guillory v. Boykins, 442 S.W.3d 682, 690 (Tex. App.–Houston [1st Dist.] 2014, no pet.), the court held that where a trial court lacks jurisdiction or statutory authority to grant the relief, the order is void . Similarly, In re P .M.G., 405 S.W.3d 406, 416–17 (Tex. App.–
Texarkana 2013, no pet.), confirms that orders entered without pleadings or outside statutory scope are null. Here, not only did the protective‐order pleadings not include any SAPCR claims,

but the later “agreed” orders on March 26, 2024 were not signed or even consented to by 
Respondent (violating Tex. R. Civ. P. 11). In short, every custody and exclusion order in this case was “predicated on a void order” . As th e Second Court of Appeals recognized in In re C.L., 933 
S.W.2d 402, 405 (Tex. App.–Fort Worth 1996, no writ), an order that is void ab initio “cannot form the basis for any valid subsequent judgment” .  That’s exactly what is happening here. The 
court is now moving to finalize fraud, constitutional deprivation, and is trying to finalize its’ original excision of Respondent’s constitutional rights. The court cannot destroy a family and then move to finalize that without a lawful basis, and over orders that are fundamentally void.  
IV . Violation of Respondent’s Constitutional Rights to Due Process and Family Integrity  
The trial court’s actions not only violated statute but also trampled Respondent’s 
fundamental constitutional rights. By evicting the Respondent from his home and effectively separating him from his children with no prior notice or opportunity to be heard , the court 
deprived him of liberty and property without due process of law. This violates Article I, § 19 of the Texas Constitution  (the “due course of law” guarantee) and the Fourteenth Amendment to 
the U.S. Constitution . Now, the court seeks to finalize this fundamental error amidst an ongoing 
appeal, showing a continuous and complete disregard for the Respondent’s rights.  
A. Deprivation of Property Without Due Process  
The January 16 order forced Respondent to vacate his own home on the same day it was 
issued. A person’s right to occupy their home is a significant property interest, protected by due process. Yet Respondent was ousted immediately, with no notice that such  relief would be sought 
and no chance to contest the allegations. The Texas Constitution and the 14
th Amendment both 
forbid the State from depriving any person of property without due process of law. Fuentes v. 
Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 81- 82 (1972) (even tempo rary, non- final deprivations of property require

notice and hearing absent extraordinary circumstances). While Texas law does allow ex parte 
orders in truly exigent circumstances, those orders must be narrowly tailored and followed promptly by a full hearing. Here, the statutory requirements for an ex pa rte kick -out were 
disregarded, and Respondent was left homeless and separated from his belongings based on one -
sided assertions. This is precisely the kind of state action that due process is meant to guard against.  
B. Deprivation of Parental Rights Without Due Process  
Even more critically, the court’s orders infringed Respondent’s fundamental right to 
parent his children, also without due process. A parent’s interest in the care, custody, and control of their children is fundamental . The United States Supreme Court has recognized that “the 
interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children…is perhaps the oldest of the 
fundamental liberty interests  recognized by this Court.” Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 
(2000) (plurality op.). Likewise, the Texas Supreme Court has affirmed that “the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children” is constitutionally protected. In re C.J.C., 603 S.W.3d 804, 811 (Tex. 2020) (citing Troxel , 530 U.S. 
at 66). Governmental interference with this right is subject to strict scrutiny and must be accomplished only with rigorous procedural safeguards.  
Here, Respondent’s removal from the home effectively altered custody of the children  
without any hearing or finding of unfitness. Respondent went from being an equal managing conservator of the children to having zero possession or access (by virtue of being excluded from the home and the children’s presence) overnight and without notice. This is a profound deprivation of parental rights. As the U.S. Supreme Court held in Stanley v. Illinois , an unwed 
father could not be presumed unfit and have his children taken without a hearing – “the Due

Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that [a father] be given a hearing on 
his fitness as a parent before  his children are removed from his custody.” Stanley v. Illinois , 405 
U.S. 645, 649 (1972) (emphasis added). The State “cannot, consistently with due process, merely presume”  a parent’s unfitness or danger and bypass a hearing; “parental unfitness 
must be established on the basis of individualized proof”  before a child is taken away. Id. at 
647, 649. Yet in Respondent’s case, the court did exactly what Stanley  forbids – it presumed the 
necessity of removing the father, without any adversarial testing of the evidence or finding of actual misconduct and left the determination for later (a hearing that kept getting postponed). This violated Respondent’s procedural due process rights to be heard before  being deprived of 
custody of his children.  
Moreover, the substantive  aspect of due process was violated. There is a “strong 
presumption that the best interest of a child is served by remaining with a fit parent.” Troxel , 
530 U.S. at 68- 69. The government may not “infringe on the fundamental right of parents to 
make child rearing decisions simply because a state judge believes a ‘better decision’ could be made .” Id.  at 72 (plurality op.). In the absence of any evidence or finding that Respondent 
was an unfit or dangerous parent, removing his children from him was an arbitrary infringement on his fundamental liberty interest. The orders entered in this case prioritized a one -sided 
allegation over a father’s constitutional rights, in a manner repugnant to both the Texas and U.S. Constitutions. Article I, Section 19 of the Texas Constitution guarantees that no citizen shall be deprived of liberty or property except by the due course of the law of the land  – here, 
Respondent was deprived of both without the lawful procedures or any adjudication of wrongdoi ng.

In sum, the process (or lack thereof) employed by the court fell far short of constitutional 
requirements. This constitutional infirmity is independently sufficient to render the court’s orders 
void. A judgment entered in violation of due process is void a nd subject to collateral attack. 
Peralta v. Heights Medical Center, Inc., 485 U.S. 80, 84- 85 (1988) (judgment rendered without 
proper notice violates due process and is void). The proper remedy for a void order that stems from a due process violation is to  declare it a nullity and dismiss any action that cannot proceed 
without it.  
VI. Plea to the Jurisdiction Must Be Granted  
The undisputed record shows no factual or legal basis for the court’s jurisdiction over the 
extreme relief granted. Under Miranda v. Texas Dept. of Parks & Wildlife , a plea to the 
jurisdiction should be granted as a matter of law if the jurisdictional facts are undisputed or uncontroverted by competent evidence. Here, there is no genuine issue that (a) no protective order was issued and no findings of family violence were made, (b) no Title 5 SAPCR notice  of 
hearing exists on the record, or  was ever on file, and (c) all of Petitioner’s requests for home 
exclusion and support were styled under Title 4 and unsupported by any pleaded conservatorship claim. The court cannot “proceed further on the merits” without first resolving these fundamenta l 
defects. Because these jurisdictional defects are purely legal, a full ev identiary hearing is 
unnecessary – the Court should rule as a matter of law that it never had authority to enter any of the challenged orders , vacate them accordingly, and allow the status quo to reset. Additionally, 
the March 14, 2024, orders are a mere extension of the initial orders, which claim consent where consent is not present. These orders must be vacated as a matter of law as this court has no power 
to rule on void orders.

Respondent puts the court on notice that this plea serves as non -appearance notice in that 
he will not participate in any further proceedings until these issues are resolved in writing on the 
record, and will challenge any orders or decisions made prior to the resolution of these issues.  
VII. PRAYER  
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Charles Dustin Myers respectfully prays that the 
Court:  
1. Rule, as a matter of law, that the January 16, 2024, exclusion and custody order and all 
subsequent temporary orders are void ab initio  for lack of subject -matter jurisdiction;  
2. Vacate and rescind those orders, and dismiss with prejudice any custody, possession, or support claims that rest on them; alternatively, dismiss all SAPCR claims for want of proper pleadings, notice, and jurisdiction;  
3. Issue a written ruling on this plea as required by law, and stay all further proceedings in this case pending resolution of this jurisdictional challenge; and 
4. Grant such other and further relief, at law or in equity, to which Respondent may be justly entitled.  
Respectfully submitted,
