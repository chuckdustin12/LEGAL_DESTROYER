NOTICE OF INTENT

Tarrant County, Texas  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Respectfully submitted, 
Charles Dustin Myers

I. INTRODUCTION 
Respondent, Relator, Defendant; representing himself in 
his own individual capacity as CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, hereby 
refrains from referring to himself in third person.  
 I find it to be repugnant. In reality, I’m simply a 
father. A father who was brought into this situation during 
the most precious time of year.  Now, while I have the 
highest respect for the judiciary, this court, and all of 
its’ participants –  today you have all left me scratching 
my head as to how after passing through two judges, a panel 
of three judges in the Second Court of Appeals followed by 
the entire court en banc, seven Justices at the highest 
level of the Texas judiciary, a regional presiding Judge, 
and a visiting retired Judge, in all of their collective 
experience, could not see the issues within this case. 
 Perhaps most shocking is how after over 1,500 pages of 
documents, pictures, sworn statements, and most importantly 
– without any opposition or engagement with any part of it 
from our friends on the other side, it’s not enough to 
overcome the apparent, deep- seated antagonism that has only 
left more questions unanswered and fraud unaddressed.

I am here not out of disrespect, but because I was 
compelled to be here. I am not seeking the world from this 
court, only answers. The relief I seek is not that of impossibility – but is that which is enshrined in the most 
fundamental protections our coun
try has to offer. It’s a 
relief that has been continuously denied time and time 
again, without any explanation.  
In fact, the latest denial actually makes the most 
sense out of any order issued so far in this case, so for 
that I am hopeful. However, the latest denial, albeit legally justified on face value, was made in error, and the only exhibit attached to this motion is the reasons why I 
believe this to be true.  
II.ISSUE
A. EFM ISSUES PREVENTED THE FILING OF A CONTINUANCE
1. Exhibit A is attached hereto for the purpose of
demonstrating a re
-occurring theme in this case. Not only 
did I have every intention of coming to the hearing, but 
given the circumstances, did everything in my power to 
communicate regarding the situation.

2. These efforts only came second to the rules of law. 
The inability to access the EFM at such a crucial juncture 
was communicated to the court and all parties relevant to 
the matter.   
3. Furthermore, the circumstances in this case have 
left me in a persistent state of planning for an inevitable appeal, such as here, where a denial as issued at the first opportunity and allows the court to escape any explanation 
for the important questions being asked of it.  
4. Given that my access to the EFM was unavailable 
during the crucial time that a sworn continuance should 
have been filed, it raises more questions which require 
answers to protect my rights that have been continuously 
violated. For example, given the circumstances, I can’t 
rely on the reason being a technicality regarding the EFM.  
B. THE DENIAL ONLY CREATES MORE UNADDRESSED ISSUES 
5. The problem I have with this decision is that the 
denial states that the opposing party appeared and that no 
evidence was admitted –  but makes no mention of the 
agreement made by the parties, the circumstances, and as

mentioned, raises more questions without any answers being 
provided.  
6. This would leave one to believe that despite the 
mutual agreement, the opposing party showed up anyway and 
acted as if no agreement was made notwithstanding that it 
mentioned that she appeared by her attorney of record, which is currently under scrutiny and remains on the long 
list of unanswered questions. 
III. NO FURTHER STATE REMEDIES 
 7. After nearly eleven months of seeking answers, only more 
questions have arisen.  
 8. If the court wishes to revisit the denial of the recusal 
given the circumstances pointed out, or in the alternative, 
adopt the still-pending motion to enter judgement and original, unmodified joint motion to recuse, it has the discretion to do so. 
 9. I am awaiting proper service of the denial via the 
electronic filing manager as required by law, and upon receipt 
will be removing the case to federal district court to address the ongoing constitutional issues that the State refuses to address.

10. The court in its perspective may see me as a 
nuisance, a pest, a fool. However, when taking a step back 
and looking at the full picture –  it’s worth a thousand 
words, as they say: 
 
You’ll notice –  no Cooper Carter. This picture is a 
collection of all case files available on the EFM up until 
the recusal was filed and is a combination of case numbers 
24-0395, 02-24-00149-CV, 322-744538-23, and 322- 744263-23 
in the order in which they were filed.

11. I’ve genuinely tried to provide every opportunity 
to the State to rectify this situation to no avail. 
 
12. The recusal wouldn’t be necessary and is not a 
reflection of the judges in this case. I’ve attempted every 
other legal avenue to accomplish such task to no avail, 
which leads us here. I hope the court can respect that.   
13. I hope the court will reconsider its’ denial of the 
recusal or do what is right so that the recusal will be 
moot. Until the current orders are either vacated or 
legally justified, I must continue to fight for my family, 
which requires that I  seek federal intervention.

IV. BASIS FOR REMOVAL 
14. Defendant, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, in the above-
captioned matter hereby provides notice of intent to remove 
this action to the United States District Court for the 
Northern District of Texas pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a) 
and § 1441(c)(1)(A). Removal is sought on the basis of 
substantial federal questions arising from alleged 
violations of Defendant’s due process rights, procedural 
negligence, and claims of unaddressed fraudulent actions by 
Plaintiff. Defendant submits the following in support of 
removal: 
A. Federal Question Jurisdiction Due to Violations of Due 
Process Rights 
15. This case raises significant federal questions 
under the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, 
specifically regarding Defendant’s right to due process. 
Defendant asserts that his due process rights have been repeatedly violated due to procedural negligence by the state court and the imposition of an agreement that was 
obtained through fraudulent claims by Plaintiff, without proper judicial scrutiny or procedural safeguards. The

state court has taken actions that have fundamentally 
deprived Defendant of a fair opportunity to present his 
case, as evidenced by the following: 
i. Plaintiff’s initial claims, including the 
unsubstantiated allegation of an active protective 
order, were not subjected to adequate evidentiary 
review or discovery. Instead, these claims were used to pressure Defendant into a settlement agreement that has 
since been revealed to be grounded in 
misrepresentation. The lack of judicial oversight in 
this process has effectively deprived Defendant of the 
ability to defend his rights and property, constituting 
a direct violation of due process. 
ii. The state court compelled Defendant to accept 
and sign a settlement agreement that Plaintiff obtained 
through alleged fraudulent representations. When Defendant contested the validity of this agreement, the 
court disregarded his objections and ordered him to 
comply without further review. This compelled 
compliance without scrutiny or due process fails to

meet the fundamental fairness standards established 
under the 14th Amendment. 
iii. Plaintiff’s actions, including conversion, 
perjury, fraud upon the court, and intentional 
destruction of marital assets remain unaddressed by the 
state court, which has shown procedural negligence in 
allowing these issues to persist without a fair review process. The absence of required discovery and 
evidentiary procedures further denies Defendant an 
opportunity to contest these fraudulent claims, 
depriving him of a fundamental right to a fair trial.  
B. Failure of the State Court to Provide an Adequate Remedy 
16. The state court has demonstrated an unwillingness 
or inability to provide an adequate remedy in this matter, 
as illustrated by its failure to address the core issues at 
the heart of Defendant’s claims. Defendant has repeatedly 
raised these issues before the state court, challenging the 
authenticity of Plaintiff’s claims and the procedural fairness of the settlement agreement. However, the court 
has continually declined to address these fundamental

issues, thereby failing to provide Defendant with an 
effective state remedy. 
17. Upon filing the Joint Mo tion to Recuse, the court 
chose to stop recording the pleadings on the EFM, chose ot 
modify the Defendant’ s documents upon forwarding them to 
the 8th Administrative Regional Judge, and the state court 
issued an erroneous denial, as outlined in Exhibit 1, without proper judicial scrutiny of either the situation or 
the issues at hand, choosing to leave them unaddressed. 
This denial is indicative of the court’s unwillingness to 
engage with the core issues of fraud and due process 
violations that affect Defendant’s rights and has left 
Defendant with no adequate remedy at the state level. 
18. The state court’s avoidance of key claims— such as 
Plaintiff’s conversion of marital assets, her perjurious 
statements, and intentional destruction of community 
property— has further deprived Defendant of the opportunity 
to have these matters fairly adjudicated. Defendant 
contends that these fraudulent actions go directly to the 
heart of his claims and that the state court’s avoidance of 
these matters amounts to a failure of procedural justice.

This avoidance underscores the need for federal 
intervention, as the state court has failed to uphold 
Defendant’s right to due process and a fair hearing. 
C. Domestic Relations Exception Does Not Apply 
19. The Domestic Relations Exception does not bar 
federal jurisdiction in this case, as Defendant is not 
seeking federal court adjudication of traditional family 
law issues such as divorce or custody. Rather, this removal 
is sought to address alleged due process violations, fraudulent claims, and procedural negligence that have 
deprived Defendant of his federally protected rights. 
Defendant seeks federal review to rectify the imposition of 
a fraudulent settlement agreement that was coerced through 
misrepresentation, extending beyond the traditional boundaries of domestic relations issues. Therefore, the Domestic Relations Exception does not apply to preclude federal review of the due process violations and fraudulent 
actions central to this case. 
D. Rooker- Feldman Doctrine Does Not Apply 
20. The Rooker-Feldman Doctrine does not bar removal 
because the state court has not issued a final judgment.

All current orders remain interlocutory, and Defendant is 
not seeking to challenge any final state court decision. 
Defendant’s removal is based on the need for federal review 
of ongoing procedural violations and due process issues that have not yet reached final adjudication in the state 
court. Since there is no final judgment, the Rooker- Feldman 
Doctrine does not apply to prevent federal intervention in 
this matter. 
E. Younger Abstention Doctrine Does Not Apply 
21. The Younger Abstention Doctrine generally bars 
federal intervention in active state proceedings. However, 
it does not apply here because Defendant is not attempting 
to disrupt the state court’s core jurisdiction over family 
law matters. Instead, Defendant seeks federal review due to ongoing procedural violations and unaddressed fraudulent actions by Plaintiff, which infringe upon Defendant’s federal rights. Federal oversight is necessary to ensure 
the protection of Defendant’s due process rights and to 
address the state court’s failure to enforce procedural 
safeguards or address Plaintiff’s fraudulent actions.

F. Ambiguity and Procedural Gaps Allow Removal Beyond the 
30-Day Window 
22. The ongoing procedural ambiguity and lack of 
resolution in the state proceedings justify removal beyond 
the standard 30- day window. The state court’s failure to 
scrutinize Plaintiff’s claims, enforce discovery, or 
provide clarifying documentation has created substantial ambiguity about the true basis for Plaintiff’s allegations 
and the validity of the coerced settlement agreement. This 
ambiguity effectively extends the removal window, as 
Defendant has not received adequate information to properly 
address these ambiguous and procedurally flawed claims. 
23. Plaintiff’s initial pleadings contain 
unsubstantiated claims impacting Defendant’s rights, and 
the state court’s failure to require discovery has prevented Defendant from understanding the basis for these claims. Due to the state court’s lack of procedural 
enforcement and transparency, Defendant’s right to remove 
remains valid until clarification and compliance with 
procedural standards are achieved.

24. Additionally, Defendant notes that the state court 
has the discretion to reconsider its prior denial, as it 
has not been formally served in compliance with Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 21a and showcases an unwillingness to 
address the issues herein. Should the court choose not to 
reconsider its prior ruling, Defendant intends to exercise 
his right to remove the case to federal court upon receipt of the denial, as outlined in the present notice, pursue 
relief from damages from Plaintiff.  
V. CONCLUSION AND PRAYER 
 In the instant case, the troubling reality of the 
court’s initial decision will bear a lifetime of 
consequence on the lives of the children it has left out of 
the equation.  
Given the significant procedural and factual issues in this 
case, Respondent respectfully requests the Court adopt one 
of the following remedies to ensure a fair and just 
outcome: 
1. Recuse Judges James Munford and Jeffrey Kaitcer from 
further proceedings, or:

2. Alternatively, deny the recusal but with instructions 
that the Honorable James Munford:  
o Vacate the current temporary orders which are 
fraudulent;  
o Adopt the temporary orders and parenting plan 
submitted by Respondent, designed to prioritize the children's stability and continuity, and 
reflect what is in their best interests;  
o Order the parties to engage in mediation to 
facilitate a cooperative resolution focused on the 
children’s best interests and future plans for 
both parents, ensuring both parties’ livelihoods 
are maintained;  
o Require participation in family counseling to 
prioritize the children’s psychological well- being 
and assess the impact of the past 11 months;  
o Order that Petitioner complete the court- ordered 
Children in the Middle parenting class, or in the 
alternative, file a notice of completion, given 
the critical information provided in this program.

Granting either of these alternatives would allow the 
Court to rectify the underlying concerns of procedural 
fairness, ensuring that the children’s welfare and stability remain the focal points of all decisions. Such actions are essential to moving this case forward in the 
most efficient and just manner.  
The issues in this case can be corrected just as 
swiftly as they were created. It is here, at the threshold 
of justice, that the court m ust exercise its’ discretion to 
correct these grave mistakes to prevent further escalation.

Subject: RE: Today's hearing at 11 CL-12105
 
Dear Ms. Baker, and Mr. Carter,
 
I am writing to respectfully request a rescheduling of today’s recusal hearing due to an unexpected medical issue. Late
last night, I began experiencing severe tooth pain, which has now escalated to significant facial swelling and intense
discomfort. The pain is currently affecting my ability to speak, eat, and focus, making it challenging to fully participate in
today’s proceedings.
 
Specifically, it's my bottom left molar which the nerve is open and exposed causing significant pain. 
 
I want to sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, especially given the efforts the court has made to
accommodate this hearing. Please know that this request is made only out of necessity, and I deeply regret the timing as
I would prefer to move the case forward.
 
This request comes with a high degree of reluctance given the unexpected technical difficulties experienced last time and
would not be making it if it wasn't absolutely necessary.
 
Thank you all for your understanding and consideration. I am committed to continuing with the hearing at the earliest
possible opportunity as I am eager to move the case forward.
 
I wanted to inform the court as soon as possible out of respect for the courts busy schedule.
 
I currently am unable to locate the case on research texas, as I've been trying to file a formal notice but given the time I
wanted to ensure the court was made aware as soon as possible of the situation.
 
Lines of communication are open for further discussion or if any further information is needed.
 
With respect,
Charles Myers
