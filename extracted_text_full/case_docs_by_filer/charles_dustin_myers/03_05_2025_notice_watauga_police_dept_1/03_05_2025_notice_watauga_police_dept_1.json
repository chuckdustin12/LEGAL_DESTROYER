      "text": "COVER LETTER \u2013  EVIDENCE FOR WATAUGA POLICE DEPARTMENT  \nTo the Reviewing Officer,  \nThank you for your time in this matter, as all other remedies have been exhausted prior to \nthis request from the department. Attached to this document are relevant materials related \nto the fraudulent documents that were prepared and presented to the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County on December 18, 2023, which led to my unjust removal from my \nresidence on January 16, 2024, prior to any notice or any hearing occu rring.  \nThese items were prepared in part by an individual not named in the case \u2014Daniel Kenneth \nBranthoover \u2014who resides in Yukon, Oklahoma. I have contacted the police department in \nthat jurisdiction to provide the same materials that have been provided here.  \nOver the weekend of December 15, 2023, Morgan Michelle Myers, the Petitioner in this \nmatter, traveled across state lines to Yukon, Oklahoma, where she received help from Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, her stepfather, in preparing attachments #1, #2, and #3, \nwhich are:  \n1. The Original Petition for Divorce  \n2. A Statement of Inability to Afford Court Costs  \n3. An Application for Protective Order  \nThis individual facilitated the transfer of $1,546 out of our joint marital bank account on \nDecember 15, 2023, and it appears as being sent to \u201cdmb575\u201d, which is Mr. Branthoover\u2019s \nPayPal account. He facilitated this transaction to help conceal her bank acc ount \ninformation. Both Mr. Branthoover and Morgan have admitted via text messages that they transferred $1,546 to Morgan and then proceeded to \ufb01le for divorce four days later \n(December 18, 2023), claiming indigency under penalty of perjury.  \nThe Statement of Inability to Afford Court Costs falsely claims that her monthly expenses \nexceed her monthly net pay and that she had no access to \ufb01nancial resources. She also \nmisrepresented separate property that she owned, such as the car payments that I have been burdened with. Furthermore, in the Original Petition for Divorce, she knowingly \nclaimed to have an active order of protection against me, which was false . \nAfter these fraudulent \ufb01lings resulted in my wrongful removal from my home on January 16, \n2024, it is important to note that this occurred on a day when the Tarrant County courts \nwere officially closed due to inclement weather (as publicly announced on th eir official \nFacebook page: https://www.facebook.com/people/Tarrant -County-District -\nCourts/100092554647052/ ).",

      "text": "Evidence Provided:  \nTo support my claims, I am submitting the following evidence:  \n1. Court Filings & Fraudulent Orders \u2013 Copies of the divorce petition, protective order \napplication, and Statement of Inability to Afford Court Costs, all of which contain \ndemonstrable falsehoods.  \n2. Financial Statements & Transaction Records \u2013 Bank records showing the December \n15, 2023 PayPal transfer of $1,546 from our joint account to Mr. Branthoover\u2019s \naccount, contradicting Petitioner\u2019s indigency claim.  \n3. Text Message Exchanges \u2013 Messages proving that both Morgan Michelle Myers and \nDaniel Kenneth Branthoover coordinated this \ufb01nancial transfer and subsequent \nfraudulent \ufb01lings.  \n4. The illegal lockout notice left on the door on March 6, 2024.  \n5. Evidence of my personal belongings from the home being disposed of despite the \norders in place (albeit fraudulent) preventing such actions.  \n6. The Associate Judge\u2019s Report signed on February 1st, which had speci\ufb01c \nrequirements for formal temporary orders to be reduced \u2013 one of which was that \nthey had to have been prepared by my prior attorney, who was terminated, and whose signature is also missing , and the other was within a 20 -day time period \u2013 \nwhich was also not adhered to.  \n7. The current orders which differ signi\ufb01cantly from the associate judge\u2019s report, claim I consent to them despite my signature not being present, and which reference a \nhearing that never occurred.  \nRequest for Assistance:  \nGiven the overwhelming evidence that my removal was based on fraudulent and \nprocedurally invalid orders, I respectfully request that the Watauga Police Department take \nthe following actions:  \n1. Acknowledge my legal right to return to my residence, as the court orders removing \nme were obtained through fraud and due process violations.  \n2. Investigate the fraudulent \ufb01lings made by Petitioner and the involvement of Daniel \nKenneth Branthoover in facilitating perjury and \ufb01nancial deception.  \n3. Prevent Petitioner from falsely claiming trespassing if I return to the residence, as \nshe obtained the house through fraudulent court orders.",

      "text": "4. File an official report documenting this matter to preserve evidence for potential \nfurther legal action.  \nClosing Statement:  \nI appreciate the department\u2019s time and effort in reviewing this evidence. I am committed to following the legal process but given that my removal was unlawful and based on fraudulent court \ufb01lings, I ask for the Watauga Police Department\u2019s immediate intervention \nin ensuring that my rights are protected.  \nPlease feel free to contact me if you require any additional documentation or testimony. I \nam willing to cooperate fully with law enforcement to ensure that justice is served  and my \nchildren\u2019s well -being are protected.  \nThe necessity of this request is more so  about the children, who are now being medically \nneglected, cared for by third parties,  the eldest is  struggling in school,  and due to the \nsigni\ufb01cant damages  that have occurred from being unable to work from out of the home  \nwhich has directly impacted their \ufb01nancial livelihood.  \nThe motive for all of this was an attempt by my wife to cover -up an affair that took place \nbetween October 2022 and the present day.  \n \nSincerely,  \nCharles Dustin Myers  \n817-546-3693  \nChuckdustin12@gmail.com",
