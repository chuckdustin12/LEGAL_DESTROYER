1. The correct names of the parties to this lawsuit.  
a. Petitioner – Morgan Michelle Myers  
b. Respondent – Charles Dustin Myers  
2. The legal theories and, in general, the factual bases of the claims or defenses of 
Respondent:  M.787 M.787
M.787 M.787 M.787 M.787

a. The Petitioner ’s Original Petition for Divorce did not meet statutory 
requirements , as the Petitioner claimed to have an active order of  
protection against the Respondent and  failed to  attach a copy to the 
Petition when filed and  did not provide a copy to the court before any 
hearing was conducted, a requirement set for th in Texas Family  Code Sec. 
6.405 (b).  
b. Despite the foregoing error, the court still ordered the Respondent out of 
his home on January 16th, 2024,  without proper notice and hearing, which 
not only violated the Respondent ’s constitutional rights, but furthermore 
failed to meet the statutory requirement se t forth in the Texas Family C ode 
Sec. 6.502 (a) which states “after notice and hear ing, the court may render 
an appropriate order, including the granting of a temporary injunction for 
the preservation of the property and protection of the parties as deemed 
necessary and equitable ”. No hearing was conducted, and no evid ence was 
heard . 
c. Furthermore, Texas Family Co de Sec. 105.001 (c)(3) outlines that “Except 
on a verified pleading or an affidavit in accordance  with the Texas Rules of 
Civil Procedure, an order may not be  rendered  excluding a parent from 
possession of or access to a  child.”  The renditions ordered on Ja nuary 16th, 
2024,  and January 22nd, 2024 were rendered in violation of this statute  as 
no visitation time was included with the order for the Respondent.  
d. Texas Family Code S ec. 105.005  mandates that the court ’s findings must be 
on based on a preponderance  of the evidence. No e vidence has been 
presented in this case relevant  to the Petitioner ’s claims of family violence 
which have governed the case  since the start.  
e. Texas Family Code Sec. 153.002  outlines that “The best interest of the child 
shall always be the primary consideration of the court in determining the 
issues of conservatorship and possession of and access to the child. ” This 
requirement was not met, as the conside ration of the children ’s best 
interests were not a factor  in the Court ’s determinations  when awarding 
the Petitioner full custody without any evidence being presented , and 
without considering  the Respondent ’s active role in their lives and his 
ability to both provide financially and emo tionally given his stay -at-home 
position.
