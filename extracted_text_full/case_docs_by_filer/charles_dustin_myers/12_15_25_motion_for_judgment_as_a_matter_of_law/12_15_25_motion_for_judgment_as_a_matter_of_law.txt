CHILDREN                                                                       TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS  
 
Respondent’s Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law (JNOV) and To Render Take -
Nothing Judgment on Petitioner’s Contested Claims  
 
TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT:  
 COMES NOW, Respondent CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS  (“Father”), who submits this 
motion for judgment as a matter of law (JNOV), and in support thereof, shows this court the 
following:  
I. INTRODUCTION  
1. Under Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(i), once a proper no-evidence motion is filed after an adequate 
time for discovery, the nonmovant must come forward with more than a scintilla of competent 
summary judgment evidence on each challenged element or the court must gr ant the motion. 
Petitioner’s response to Father’s no -evidence motion was unsigned and relied on future 
testimony and unauthenticated materials; it failed to direct the Court to competent, cited 
summary judgment proof and thus could not defeat the motion. At trial, Petitioner admitted 
material falsities concerning indigence and family violence and offered no exhibits or competent 
proof on her pleaded claims, confirming the total failure of proof.  §

 2. Despite this record, the Court denied Father’s no -evidence motion by letter ruling and set 
the matter for trial; Petitioner’s counsel did not submit the order as directed. The trial proceeded; 
no exhibits were admitted by Morgan Michelle Myers (“Petitioner ”); and the Court took the case 
under advisement. The complete absence of evidence on essential elements requires judgment as a matter of law in Father’s favor on Petitioner’s contested claims. The Court should now render judgment accordingly and enter final orders consistent with Respondent’s live pleadings and the 
evidence of record.  
II. BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL POSTURE  
3. Father filed a no -evidence motion specifically challenging essential elements of 
Petitioner’s claims, including: (i) family violence; (ii) existence of any protective order with a finding of family violence; (iii) Petitioner’s indigence on filing; (iv) no tice and hearing 
supporting February 1, 2024 temporary relief; (v) alleged agreement to March 14, 2024 
“Agreed” orders; and (vi) best -interest proof for onerous temporary orders . 
4. Petitioner filed an unsigned response asserting that there were genuine issues for trial and 
requesting fees, but identified no competent summary judgment proof by citation and relied on 
anticipated trial testimony and unauthenticated materials.  
5. By letter dated December 9, 2025, the Court denied Father’s no-evidence motion and 
directed Petitioner’s counsel to prepare an order denying relief prior to the December 10, 2025 trial. No proposed order was submitted by Petitioner’s counsel; trial commen ced; Petitioner 
presented no exhibits; and the Court took the matter under advisement  after Petitioner admitted 
on the record to lying about family violence to obtain the children and the residence. 6. She also brought unfounded allegations not raised in her pleadings for the first time at 
trial.

 III. LEGAL STANDARDS  
A. No-evidence summary judgment  
7. Under Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(i ), after adequate time for discovery, a movant may challenge 
specific elements on which the nonmovant bears the burden. The nonmovant must produce more 
than a scintilla of competent summary judgment evidence raising a genuine issue on each 
challenged element or the court must grant the motion. See King Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman, 118 
S.W.3d 742 (Tex. 2003); Mack Trucks, Inc. v. Tamez , 206 S.W.3d 572 (Tex. 2006).  
B. Competent summary judgment evidence and specificity  
8. Pleadings and unsworn assertions are not evidence; oral testimony at the hearing is 
prohibited. Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c). The response must specifically identify, with record citations, the competent proof on file to be considered. General references or promises of future testimony 
are insufficient. See DeGrate v. Executive Imprints, Inc., 261 S.W.3d 402, 408 (Tex. App.—Tyler 
2008, no pet.).  
C. Judgment as a matter of law following trial  
9. In a bench trial, the court must render judgment in accordance with the law and the 
evidence. A claim fails for legal insufficiency when there is a complete absence of evidence of a 
vital fact or the evidence is no more than a scintilla. See King Ranch, 118 S.W.3d at 751. The 
court may render judgment notwithstanding the absence of competent proof or on deemed 
admissions. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 301.  
D. Deemed admissions and unpleaded claims 
10. Unanswered requests for admissions are deemed admitted and conclusively establish the 
matter unless withdrawn by motion and order. Tex. R. Civ. P. 198.2(c), 198.3. Issues not raised

4 
 by the pleadings are tried by consent only if the parties clearly consent; otherwise, the court must 
confine judgment to pleaded issues. Tex. R. Civ. P. 67, 301. 
IV. ANALYSIS  
A. Petitioner failed to defeat the no-evidence motion; the Court should render take -nothing 
on the challenged elements.  
 
11.  Father’s motion identified the specific elements for which no evidence existed and shifted 
the burden to Petitioner. Petitioner’s unsigned response relied on generalized assertions, 
unauthenticated materials, and future testimony; it did not direct the Co urt to competent, cited 
proof on file. This is legally insufficient to defeat a Rule 166a(i) motion as a matter of law. See DeGrate , 261 S.W.3d at 408. 
12. The Court’s letter denial did not identify any competent evidence meeting Petitioner’s 
burden, and Petitioner’s counsel did not submit the ordered proposed denial, further underscoring the absence of record support. Accordingly, a take -nothing judgment on Petitioner’s contested 
claims (family violence findings, existence of a protective order, indigence, alleged agreement to “Agreed Orders,” and best -interes t predicate for restrictive temporary orders) should now be 
rendered.  
B. Trial confirmed a total failure of proof and included incurable admissions by Petitioner  
13. At trial, Petitioner introduced no exhibits supporting her pleaded claims and admitted to 
material falsehoods regarding indigence and family violence—facts that directly negate the essential elements she pleaded. Oral testimony consisting of unpleaded clai ms raised for the first 
time is not a lawful substitute for the complete absence of competent proof on the live pleadings, particularly where Respondent objected and did not consent. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 67, 301. On this record, there is a complete absence of evidence on vital facts, requiring judgment as a matter of law. See King Ranch, 118 S.W.3d at 751.

5 
 C. Deemed admissions and unpleaded issues independently compel judgment  
14. Petitioner failed to respond to Father’s written discovery, resulting in deemed admissions 
that conclusively establish certain issues unless withdrawn by motion and order, which Petitioner 
did not obtain. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 198.2(c), 198.3. The Court should render judgment consistent with the deemed admissions and disregard unpleaded, last‑minute claims to which Respondent did not consent. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 67.  
D. The Court should now render final judgment consistent with the record  
15. Given (i) Petitioner’s failure to defeat the no -evidence motion; (ii) Petitioner’s lack of 
trial exhibits; (iii) Petitioner’s admissions discrediting essential elements; (iv) deemed admissions; and (v) the absence of trial by consent, the Court should render a take -nothing 
judgment on Petitioner’s contested claims and enter a final decree that:  
i. Grants a divorce on no -fault grounds as pleaded;  
ii. Respondent respectfully requests that the Court implement his proposed parenting and property transition plan, which includes immediate restoration of his access to the marital residence located at [insert address], currently owned by Petitioner’s grandmot her. 
Respondent relied on this residence for his business operations and as his primary place of work and income. The abrupt and prolonged exclusion from the home —based solely 
on allegations that Petitioner has now admitted were false—caused severe financi al and 
professional harm, as well as disruption to the children’s stability and the family’s status quo. Accordingly, Respondent requests that the Court order a reasonable transition 
period, during which he may re -establish his business activities and resume a normal 
parental role, including but not limited to:

6 
  a.  Immediate access to the residence for a period of not less than eight  
  months  to facilitate the transition and recovery of business    
  assets ; 
 b. Restoration of his ability to work from the home office ; 
 c. Uninterrupted access to the children in accordance with the best interest  
  standard, and  
 d. Any further relief necessary to restore the parties and children to the  
  position they would have occupied but for the false allegations and  
  resulting exclusion.  
 iii. Denies Petitioner’s request for family violence findings and any relief  dependent on  
     those findings;  
 iv. Denies Petitioner’s request for sole managing conservatorship predicated on family    
      violence or child abuse allegations;  
 v. Declines to confirm any protective order or family violence finding;  
 vi. Declares there is no evidence that Father agreed to the March 14, 2024 “Agreed”  
     Orders and that any such characterization is not binding on Father; further, that child     
     support arrears cannot be derived from an “Agreed Order” only agreed to by one party;  
 vii. Determines conservatorship, possession, and child support in accordance with the    
       evidence actually admitted (and not on unpleaded claims), the best interest standard     
       under Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002, and the statutory guidelines where applicable;  
 viii. Divides the community estate in a just and right manner based on admitted evidence, 
        denying any disproportionate division request predicated on unproven fault; and

7 
  ix. Taxes costs and fees as set forth below.  
V. SANCTIONS, COSTS, AND FEES  
16. Petitioner’s sworn indigence and family -violence claims were admitted at trial to be false. 
Father requests that the Court:  
 i.  Strike Petitioner’s false statements from the record;  
 ii.  Impose sanctions under Tex. R. Civ. P. 13 and/or Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.  
  Code ch. 10 for groundless pleadings brought in bad faith or for the  
  purpose of harassment, after notice and opportunity to be heard;  
 iii.  Award Father his reasonable and necessary fees and expenses incurred in  
  responding to Petitioner’s groundless allegations, including the   
  no-evidence motion, hearing(s), and trial preparation necessitated by  
  Petitioner’s conduct; and  retainment of prior counsel;  
 iv. Tax all court costs against Petitioner.  
VI. ALTERNATIVE RELIEF  
17. If the Court declines to render final judgment at this time, Father alternatively requests:  
 i.  Entry of written Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on Petitioner’s  
  failure  of proof on each challenged element and on the legal effect of  
  deemed admissions;  
 ii.  An order striking unpleaded claims and excluding any evidence not timely 
  disclosed;  
 iii.  An order inviting Father to submit a Proposed Final Decree consistent  
  with this motion within 10 days; and

8 
  iv.  Any other relief necessary to effectuate prompt rendition consistent with  
  the record.  
VII. JUD ICIAL NOTICE  
18. Respondent requests the Court take judicial notice of the following facts that have 
significantly undermined the legitimacy of these proceedings . Petitioner ’s initial fabrications 
combined with this Court ’s misapplication of the law has lead to a two -year long effort by the 
Respondent to correct the  following errors of law:  
A. Tex. Fam. Code § 6.405(b) ’s Protections Were Ignored  
19. Pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code § 6.405(b), when a Petitioner claims that an active order of 
protection exists with a finding of family violence, which is what happened here, a “…copy of 
the order is not available at the time of filing, the petition must state that a copy of the order will 
be filed with the court before any hearing .” (emphasis added)  
20. On January 16, 2024, these protections were disregarded, and the Respondent was 
ordered to vacate his residence on four hours ’ notice. In essence, Petitioner now admits that this 
claim was fal se, and is a prima facie showing of extrinsic fraud  as it prevented Respondent from 
presenting his case, leading to his unjust removal from his matrimonial residence.  
21. Pursuant to the rule, the Court had no discretion to order his vacatur without the required 
copy of the alleged active protective order .  
B. Tex. Fam. Code § 85.001’ s Protections Were Ignored  
22. Even if the court had the copy of the protective order  (which doesn’ t exist) , it still failed 
to enter into the record the required findings before making the initial , drastic custody

9 
 determination  that it made on January 16, 2024. “ [A]t the close of a hearing on an application for 
a protective order, the court shall find whether family violence has occurred .” Here, that didn ’t 
happen, and the deprivation of Respondent ’s rights was compounded.  
C. Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001’ s Protections Were Ignored  
23. Section 105.001 governs temporary orders in suits affecting the parent -child relationship 
(SAPCRs). It provides that, except in certain emergency situations, a court may not issue 
temporary orders affecting possession or access to a child without notice an d a hearing.  
24.  Specifically, the statute prohibits rendering an order excluding a parent from possession 
or access to a child unless there is a verified pleading or affidavit in accordance with the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. The only exception to this requirement is  for emergency orders sought 
by a governmental entity under Chapter 262, which may be rendered without notice and an adversary hearing in certain circumstances. This provision is designed to ensure that parents are not summarily deprived of their rights to possession or access without due process, except in emergencies involving child protection by the state, proposition,  Tex. Fam. Code § 105.001. 
25. Here, the Court ’s actions were in direct  contrast to the protections the legislature afforded 
to litigants , and it awarded relief to the parent who, by  her own admissions, brought the suit in 
bad faith  and lied under oath.  
D. Tex. Fam. Code  § 201.006 Was Disregarded  
26. The Texas Family Code, specifically section 201.006, governs the referral of cases to 
associate judges. This provision mandates that a district judge must  render either an individual  
order of referral for a specific case or a general  order of referral specifying the types of cases that

10 
 may be heard by an associate judge. The statute is clear that such an order is a procedural  
prerequisite for an associate judge to exercise authority over a matter.  
27. On top of the due process violations above, the Court erred further when it reset the 
matter before Honorable Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer  on January 22, 2024, without an order 
of referral, and without a general standing order of referral in place.  
28. However, t he authorities also make clear that, even if an associate judge acts without  
authority, the referring district judge may later adopt or sign the associate judge’s 
recommendations, thereby curing the defect and rendering the  order effective from the date of 
adoption.  
29. As of filing this document, no such adoption has taken place, meaning all settings 
following January 16, 2024, are procedurally invalid, including the February 1, 2024, setting where a settlement  was drafted, the March 14, 2024, cha llenging t hat settlement, and the 
temporary orders that followed which bears only the Petitioner ’s signature.  
30. The only exception to this general rule is for emergency orders sought by a governmental 
entity under Chapter 262. Even in such cases, the statutes impose strict procedural safeguards. Section 262.102 allows for ex parte emergency removal only if there is immediate danger to the child and no time for a hearing.  
31. The Court need look no further than this sequence of events to recognize that the 
Respondent ’s rights were initially deprived, and then only compounded through future 
proceedings . 
32. The Court now has an opportunity to correct this grave mis carriage of justice by granting 
him the unopposed relief he has been seeking for nearly two years as a matter of law.
