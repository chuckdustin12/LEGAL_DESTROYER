INTRODUCTION  \n1. Under Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(i), once a proper no-evidence motion is filed after an adequate \ntime for discovery, the nonmovant must come forward with more than a scintilla of competent \nsummary judgment evidence on each challenged element or the court must gr ant the motion. \nPetitioner\u2019s response to Father\u2019s no -evidence motion was unsigned and relied on future \ntestimony and unauthenticated materials; it failed to direct the Court to competent, cited \nsummary judgment proof and thus could not defeat the motion. At trial, Petitioner admitted \nmaterial falsities concerning indigence and family violence and offered no exhibits or competent \nproof on her pleaded claims, confirming the total failure of proof.  \u00a7 \n\u00a7 \n\u00a7 \n\u00a7 \n\u00a7 \n\u00a7 \n\u00a7 \n\u00a7 \n\u00a7 \n\u00a7 \n\u00a7",

Despite this record, the Court denied Father\u2019s no -evidence motion by letter ruling and set \nthe matter for trial; Petitioner\u2019s counsel did not submit the order as directed. The trial proceeded; \nno exhibits were admitted by Morgan Michelle Myers (\u201cPetitioner \u201d); and the Court took the case \nunder advisement. The complete absence of evidence on essential elements requires judgment as a matter of law in Father\u2019s favor on Petitioner\u2019s contested claims. The Court should now render judgment accordingly and enter final orders consistent with Respondent\u2019s live pleadings and the \nevidence of record.  \nII. BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL POSTURE  \n3. Father filed a no -evidence motion specifically challenging essential elements of \nPetitioner\u2019s claims, including: (i) family violence; (ii) existence of any protective order with a finding of family violence; (iii) Petitioner\u2019s indigence on filing; (iv) no tice and hearing \nsupporting February 1, 2024 temporary relief; (v) alleged agreement to March 14, 2024 \n\u201cAgreed\u201d orders; and (vi) best -interest proof for onerous temporary orders . \n4. Petitioner filed an unsigned response asserting that there were genuine issues for trial and \nrequesting fees, but identified no competent summary judgment proof by citation and relied on \nanticipated trial testimony and unauthenticated materials.  \n5. By letter dated December 9, 2025, the Court denied Father\u2019s no-evidence motion and \ndirected Petitioner\u2019s counsel to prepare an order denying relief prior to the December 10, 2025 trial. No proposed order was submitted by Petitioner\u2019s counsel; trial commen ced; Petitioner \npresented no exhibits; and the Court took the matter under advisement  after Petitioner admitted \non the record to lying about family violence to obtain the children and the residence. 6. She also brought unfounded allegations not raised in her pleadings for the first time at \ntrial.",

P. 166a(i ), after adequate time for discovery, a movant may challenge \nspecific elements on which the nonmovant bears the burden. The nonmovant must produce more \nthan a scintilla of competent summary judgment evidence raising a genuine issue on each \nchallenged element or the court must grant the motion. See King Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman, 118 \nS.W.3d 742 (Tex. 2003); Mack Trucks, Inc. v. Tamez , 206 S.W.3d 572 (Tex. 2006).  \nB. Competent summary judgment evidence and specificity  \n8. Pleadings and unsworn assertions are not evidence; oral testimony at the hearing is \nprohibited. Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c). The response must specifically identify, with record citations, the competent proof on file to be considered. General references or promises of future testimony \nare insufficient. See DeGrate v. Executive Imprints, Inc., 261 S.W.3d 402, 408 (Tex. App.\u2014Tyler \n2008, no pet.).  \nC. Judgment as a matter of law following trial  \n9. In a bench trial, the court must render judgment in accordance with the law and the \nevidence. A claim fails for legal insufficiency when there is a complete absence of evidence of a \nvital fact or the evidence is no more than a scintilla. See King Ranch, 118 S.W.3d at 751. The \ncourt may render judgment notwithstanding the absence of competent proof or on deemed \nadmissions. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 301.  \nD. Deemed admissions and unpleaded claims \n10. Unanswered requests for admissions are deemed admitted and conclusively establish the \nmatter unless withdrawn by motion and order. Tex. R. Civ. P. 198.2(c), 198.3. Issues not raised",

ANALYSIS  \nA. Petitioner failed to defeat the no-evidence motion; the Court should render take -nothing \non the challenged elements.  \n \n11.  Father\u2019s motion identified the specific elements for which no evidence existed and shifted \nthe burden to Petitioner. Petitioner\u2019s unsigned response relied on generalized assertions, \nunauthenticated materials, and future testimony; it did not direct the Co urt to competent, cited \nproof on file. This is legally insufficient to defeat a Rule 166a(i) motion as a matter of law. See DeGrate , 261 S.W.3d at 408. \n12. The Court\u2019s letter denial did not identify any competent evidence meeting Petitioner\u2019s \nburden, and Petitioner\u2019s counsel did not submit the ordered proposed denial, further underscoring the absence of record support. Accordingly, a take -nothing judgment on Petitioner\u2019s contested \nclaims (family violence findings, existence of a protective order, indigence, alleged agreement to \u201cAgreed Orders,\u201d and best -interes t predicate for restrictive temporary orders) should now be \nrendered.  \nB. Trial confirmed a total failure of proof and included incurable admissions by Petitioner  \n13. At trial, Petitioner introduced no exhibits supporting her pleaded claims and admitted to \nmaterial falsehoods regarding indigence and family violence\u2014facts that directly negate the essential elements she pleaded. Oral testimony consisting of unpleaded clai ms raised for the first \ntime is not a lawful substitute for the complete absence of competent proof on the live pleadings, particularly where Respondent objected and did not consent. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 67, 301. On this record, there is a complete absence of evidence on vital facts, requiring judgment as a matter of law. See King Ranch, 118 S.W.3d at 751.",

Petitioner failed to respond to Father\u2019s written discovery, resulting in deemed admissions \nthat conclusively establish certain issues unless withdrawn by motion and order, which Petitioner \ndid not obtain. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 198.2(c), 198.3. The Court should render judgment consistent with the deemed admissions and disregard unpleaded, last\u2011minute claims to which Respondent did not consent. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 67.  \nD. The Court should now render final judgment consistent with the record  \n15. Given (i) Petitioner\u2019s failure to defeat the no -evidence motion; (ii) Petitioner\u2019s lack of \ntrial exhibits; (iii) Petitioner\u2019s admissions discrediting essential elements; (iv) deemed admissions; and (v) the absence of trial by consent, the Court should render a take -nothing \njudgment on Petitioner\u2019s contested claims and enter a final decree that:  \ni.

Respondent requests the Court take judicial notice of the following facts that have \nsignificantly undermined the legitimacy of these proceedings . Petitioner \u2019s initial fabrications \ncombined with this Court \u2019s misapplication of the law has lead to a two -year long effort by the \nRespondent to correct the  following errors of law:  \nA. Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 6.405(b) \u2019s Protections Were Ignored  \n19. Pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 6.405(b), when a Petitioner claims that an active order of \nprotection exists with a finding of family violence, which is what happened here, a \u201c\u2026copy of \nthe order is not available at the time of filing, the petition must state that a copy of the order will \nbe filed with the court before any hearing .\u201d (emphasis added)  \n20. On January 16, 2024, these protections were disregarded, and the Respondent was \nordered to vacate his residence on four hours \u2019 notice. In essence, Petitioner now admits that this \nclaim was fal se, and is a prima facie showing of extrinsic fraud  as it prevented Respondent from \npresenting his case, leading to his unjust removal from his matrimonial residence.  \n21. Pursuant to the rule, the Court had no discretion to order his vacatur without the required \ncopy of the alleged active protective order .  \nB. Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 85.001\u2019 s Protections Were Ignored  \n22.

Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 105.001\u2019 s Protections Were Ignored  \n23. Section 105.001 governs temporary orders in suits affecting the parent -child relationship \n(SAPCRs). It provides that, except in certain emergency situations, a court may not issue \ntemporary orders affecting possession or access to a child without notice an d a hearing.  \n24.  Specifically, the statute prohibits rendering an order excluding a parent from possession \nor access to a child unless there is a verified pleading or affidavit in accordance with the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. The only exception to this requirement is  for emergency orders sought \nby a governmental entity under Chapter 262, which may be rendered without notice and an adversary hearing in certain circumstances. This provision is designed to ensure that parents are not summarily deprived of their rights to possession or access without due process, except in emergencies involving child protection by the state, proposition,  Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 105.001. \n25. Here, the Court \u2019s actions were in direct  contrast to the protections the legislature afforded \nto litigants , and it awarded relief to the parent who, by  her own admissions, brought the suit in \nbad faith  and lied under oath.  \nD. Tex. Fam. Code  \u00a7 201.006 Was Disregarded  \n26. The Texas Family Code, specifically section 201.006, governs the referral of cases to \nassociate judges. This provision mandates that a district judge must  render either an individual  \norder of referral for a specific case or a general  order of referral specifying the types of cases that",

On top of the due process violations above, the Court erred further when it reset the \nmatter before Honorable Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer  on January 22, 2024, without an order \nof referral, and without a general standing order of referral in place.  \n28. However, t he authorities also make clear that, even if an associate judge acts without  \nauthority, the referring district judge may later adopt or sign the associate judge\u2019s \nrecommendations, thereby curing the defect and rendering the  order effective from the date of \nadoption.  \n29. As of filing this document, no such adoption has taken place, meaning all settings \nfollowing January 16, 2024, are procedurally invalid, including the February 1, 2024, setting where a settlement  was drafted, the March 14, 2024, cha llenging t hat settlement, and the \ntemporary orders that followed which bears only the Petitioner \u2019s signature.  \n30. The only exception to this general rule is for emergency orders sought by a governmental \nentity under Chapter 262. Even in such cases, the statutes impose strict procedural safeguards. Section 262.102 allows for ex parte emergency removal only if there is immediate danger to the child and no time for a hearing.  \n31. The Court need look no further than this sequence of events to recognize that the \nRespondent \u2019s rights were initially deprived, and then only compounded through future \nproceedings . \n32.
