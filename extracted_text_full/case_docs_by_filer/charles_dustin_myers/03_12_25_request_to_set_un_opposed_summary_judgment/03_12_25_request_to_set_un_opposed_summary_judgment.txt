1.COOPER L. CARTER has had ample time to submit a reply or response in opposition
to the above-mentioned motions but has failed to do so.
2.COOPER L. C
ARTER has had ample time to show her authority either through a
verified affidavit or filing a notice of appeara nce.
3.COOPER L. CARTER has failed to reply to t he requested admissions wi thin  the
statutory time frame. Pursuant to T
exas law, the requested  admissions are now deemed
admitted without the necessity of a court order. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 198.
4.Once an
 admission is admitted or deemed admitted, it becomes a judicial admission,
and a party may not introduce evidence to contradict it.  Marshall v. Vi
se, 767 S.W.2d
at 700; Sherman Acquisition II LP v. Garcia, 229 S.W.3d 802, 812 (Tex. App.—W aco

5.Deemed admissions are competent summary judgment evidence . Schafer v. Federal
Servs. Corp., 875 S.W.2d 455, 457 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.]1994, no writ)
(holding that trial court was free to consider deemed admissions, although not
specifically referenced in motion for summary judgment); TEX. R. CIV . P. 166a(c)
6.The requested and unanswered admissions have been attached as Exhibit 1.
Thus, considering the above, the Respondent is entitled to S ummary Judgment as a 
matter
 of law as no  genuine dispute of  material fact exists outside of damage s. Respondent asks 
the clerk of the court to promptly set these matters for submission and provide the relief 
requested in the motion given no opposition has been raised by the oppos ing party. The summary

IN THE 322nd DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY  
STATE OF TEXAS  
Morgan Michelle Myers,  Cause No. 322 -744263 -23 
Petitioner,  
v. 
RESPONDENT’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL 
SUMMARY JUDGEMENT  
Charles Dustin Myers,  
Respondent  
Pursuant to Rule 166a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure ¹, the Respondent, Charles 
Dustin Myers, firmly seeks a partial Summary Judgment  in regard to  the upcoming 
hearing scheduled for March 14th, 2024 . He categorically asserts that the evidence on file 
with the Court definitively demonstrates there is no genuine issue as to any material fact 
related to the allegations against him which have led to his unwarranted removal from 
his home, significantly disrupted his business operations, and unjustly grante d the 
Petitioner full custody of their children and possession of the family home  on a 
temporary basi s. 
The Respondent has meticulously and persistently contested the baseless allegations of 
family violence that have unjustly prejudiced the custody resolution to the detriment of 
the children's interests. The absence of substantive evidence supporting these claims has 
been made clear through detailed submissions. ²  This unwarranted influence on custody  
¹ Rule 166a specifically allows for summary judgment when "the pleadings, depositions, answers to 
interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine 
issue as to any material fact and that the moving  party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." This 
provision is utilized here to highlight the lack of factual dispute regarding the allegations of family 
violence  which have led to the continuation of unlawful temporary orders currently in place . 
² Submissions on record filed by the Respondent: Motion of Continuance (granted), Motion of 
Consolidation (granted), Protective Order Answer (ignored), Counter Petition for Divorce (ignored), 
Motion of Withdrawal for Attorney (granted), Emergency Motion of Reconsideration of Evidence and to 
Vacate Temporary Orders (Scheduled for March 14th, 2024) . See attach ed EXHIBIT A.  322-744263-23

arrangements negate  the principles of fairness and due process. The subsequent 
dismissal of the Protective Order suit not only vindicates the Respondent but also 
invalidates the current custody orders, revealing that the initial award of custody was  
grounded solely in unsubstantiated claims of family violence. ³ 
 
BACKGROUND  
The documents on record  filed by the Respondent , by virtue of their acceptance , 
inherently meet the threshold for self -authentication, thereby bolstering the legal 
foundation for the requested partial Summary Judgment. Detailed herewith are the 
enumerated  facts underpinning this motion:  
1. On December 14th, 2023, the Petitioner sought an EX -PARTE Order of 
Protection from the Court, which was judiciously denied, affirming the 
absence of immediate threat or harm that warranted such an extraordinary 
measure. Undeterred by this judicial determin ation, the Petitioner proceeded 
to file for divorce on December 18th, 2023, misleadingly alleging the existence 
of an active Order of Protection against the Respondent. This deliberate 
misrepresentation constitutes not merely an attempt to skew the legal p rocess 
in the Petitioner’s favor but represents a flagrant abuse of the judicial system 
designed to secure an undue advantage in the divorce proceedings, which ha s 
ultimately been successful.  
 
2. On December 22nd, 2023, the Petitioner initiated a subsequent application for 
a Protective Order, forming the cornerstone of litigation since the initial 
hearing on January 16th, 2024.  
 
3. On January 16th, 2024, the Court  rendered Temporary Orders which required 
the Respondent to vacate his family home and  give up custody of his children 
on the presumption of family violence. The Court’s decision did not meet the 
statutory requirements of the Texas Family Code, Sec. 6.502. ⁴ 
 
³ The non-suit of the protective order entitles the Respondent to this Partial Summary Judgement as a 
matter of law, as there is now no genuine dispute over the baselessness of the allegations made against 
him which are the foundation of the current temporary orders in place.  
⁴ Sec. 6.502 mandates that a Court may make such a decision while a suit for dissolution of a marriage is 
pending and on the motion of a party or on the court's own motion after notice and hearing . No hearing 
took place, and no reasonable notice was given prior to the decision rendered on January 16th, 2024.

4. On January 22nd, 2024, before the start of the reset hearing, the Petitioner   
acquired legal counsel at the last minute, delaying the case further until the 
reset date of February 1st, 2024 . 
 
5. On February 1st, 2024, both parties entered into an agreement which allowed 
the respondent back into the home on a temporary basis, yet still awarded the 
Petitioner with full custody of the children.  The Respondent was given 30 days 
per the agreement to remain in the home. Despite having the ability to stay 
next door, and after dropping the Protective Suit that initiated and are the 
foundation for this agreement , the Petitioner chose to stay with her friend 9 
miles away and remove the children from their stable environment . 
 
6. On February 5th, 2024, the Respondent discharged his Legal Counsel for failure 
to address any of the issues  mentioned herewith, and for failure to diligently 
represent the Respondent, as no genuine effort was made to make the court 
aware of these errors.  The Protective Order suit was non -suited on this day, 
invalidating the current agreement, and requiring by law that the Court reset 
the case back to the status quo ante until a fair discovery process can be 
conducted on relevant matters to the divorce proceeding, and restoring order 
back into the lives of the Respondent and his Children.  
 
7. The Petitioner's decision to reside outside the family home, despite alternatives 
that would minimize disruption during this transitional period, is a deliberate 
choice. This choice, made independently, should not facilitate the continuation 
of unfounded c laims that have since been dismissed. Such actions have unduly 
influenced the living arrangements and well -being of the children at the heart 
of this case . 
 
8. The Respondent explicitly refrains from pursuing any sanctions or penalties 
against the Petitioner, emphasizing instead a heartfelt plea for a reasonable 
transition period. This adjustment period is advocated as crucial for 
safeguarding the welfare of his children, himself, and the Petitioner, ensuring 
their collective long -term well -being. Furthermore, the Respondent 
underscores that the prevailing custody determinations were unjustly 
predicated on unsubstantiated allegations of family violence —a point 
underscored by the unequivocal dismissal of the Protective Order, which 
confirms the absence of any contested material facts .

LEGAL BASIS  
The legal foundation for this Partial Summary Judgment is firmly rooted in the principles 
and mandates of the law, notably where the current temporary orders are predicated on 
unsubstantiated claims of family violence, for which no concrete evidence has been 
presented. This lack of evidence fundamentally challenges the integrity and validity of 
the orders affectin g the lives and welfare of the children involved. The necessity for the 
court to vacate these orders and revert to the status quo ante is underscored by the 
following critical legal argument s: 
1 . Misalignment with Texas Family Code Sec. 105.001:   
 
1.1 The orders issued on January 16th, 2024, and continued on January 
22nd, 2024, starkly conflict with Texas Family Code Sec. 105.001, which 
unequivocally necessitates notice and a hearing prior to the issuance of 
such orders. This statute ensures that partie s are given a fair opportunity to 
be heard, a fundamental aspect of due process, which was conspicuously 
absent in this case.  
 
2. Contravention of Texas Family Code Sec. 105.005:  
2.1 The initial rendering of temporary orders on January 16th, 2024, did 
not adhere to Texas Family Code Sec. 105.005 , requiring that court's 
findings be grounded in a preponderance of the evidence  before making 
any child custody determination affecting the parent -child relationship .  
 
2.2 The absence of evidence from the Petitioner, juxtaposed with the 
disregard for the Respondent's timely submissions, underscores a 
significant deviation from this legal requirement.  
 
3. Violation of Texas Family Code Sec. 153.002:   
 
3.1 The proceedings failed to prioritize "The best interest of the child," as 
mandated by Texas Family Code Sec. 153.002. This principle, deemed 
paramount in determining issues of conservatorship, possession, and 
access, was overlooked.  
 
3.2 The Respondent's work -from-home situation and the need for a

reasonable transition period to maintain his pivotal role in his children ’s 
lives were disregarded, further exacerbating the impact of the Petitioner ’s 
actions and the court ’s decisions on the children ’s stability and well -being.  
4. Equal Opportunity and Fair Hearing (Sec. 152.205 & Sec. 105.003):  
4.1 The Texas Family Code Sec. 152.205  and Sec. 105.003  enshrine the 
necessity for equitable procedural rights, mandating that all parties are 
granted a fair opportunity for notification and a meaningful hearing. The 
Respondent ’s ability to engage fully in the hearing process and to present a 
comprehensive defense was significantly impeded, a deviation from the 
due process envisaged by these statutes. Consequently, the temporary 
orders issued lack the foundational fairness that i s central to the justice 
system and contravene the legal safeguards intended to ensure balanced 
participation by all parties in family law proceedings.  
 
5. Managing Conservatorship Considerations (Sec. 153.005 & Sec. 153.007):  
5.1 In deliberations of conservatorship, Texas Family Code Sec. 153.005 
obligates the court to deliberate thoroughly on the child ’s best interest, 
including the living circumstances and stability provided by the parents. 
Additionally, Sec. 153.007  advocates for the establishment of a mutually 
agreed parenting plan, prioritizing the child ’s welfare and the continuity of 
their established routine. The current  custodial provisions do not 
correspond with a collaboratively designed parenting plan that satisfies 
these essential criteria. Given the disproven allegations of family violence 
and the unnecessary protective measures imposed during this period of 
change, it is imperative for the Court to rescind these provisional measures. 
The immediate restoration of the status quo ante is crucial to uphold the 
children ’s best interest, allowing for a planned and considerate period of 
adjustment that acknowledges the absence of any immediate risk or harm 
to their well -being  and without disruption to the Respondent’s business 
operations at -home.  
 
6. Rules of Dispositions for Family Law Cases – (Tarrant County Rules):  
6.1 The provisions under Rule 4.02: Trial Procedures of the Tarrant Family 
Rules , specifically Part 4  concerning the disposition of family law cases, 
have been notably contravened in the ongoing proceedings of the. This rule

mandates that, except upon order of the Court or a showing of good cause,  
and notably in cases involving the characterization, value, or division of 
property, each party is required to provide the Court and opposing counsel 
with a concise written summary of the relief requested and, in the context 
of a final trial, the party’s i nventory and appraisement and proposed 
division of property and debts at the time of the temporary hearing, final 
trial, or other court proceeding.  
 
6.2 The failure to adhere to this procedural requirement undermines the 
fairness and efficiency of the legal process, particularly in this case where 
the Respondent, has faced significant challenges and disruptions based on 
temporary orders and allegations wit hout the foundation of substantiated 
evidence or the proper procedural disclosures as outlined by Rule 4.02 . The 
absence of such critical documentation and summaries from the Petitioner 
has not only impaired the Respondent's ability to prepare and present a 
comprehensive defense but has also deprived the Court of essential 
information necessary for a fair and informed decision -making process . 
 
7. Rule 60. Relief from a Judgment or Order ( Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure):  
7.1 In accordance with Rule 60(b)  of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure , 
this motion seeks relief from the temporary orders previously granted, and 
which are the basis of the current orders, which have unjustifiably removed 
the Respondent  from his residence and disrupted his custodial rights 
without substantial evidence. Rule 60(b)  expressly allows for such relief 
under conditions including, but not limited to, mistake, inadvertence, 
surprise, excusable neglect, and most pertinently, fraud or 
misrepresentatio n by an opposing party. Given the demonstrated lack of 
evidence supporting the allegations of family violence and the procedural 
discrepancies noted throughout the initiation and execution of these 
temporary orders, it is imperative that the court immediately vacate the 
current arrangements as their basis no longer exists . The circumstances 
surrounding the issuance of these orders align with the instances wherein 
Rule 60(b)  provides clear recourse for relief, underscoring the necessity for 
their immediate reevaluation to restore fairness and ensure justice is served 
in accordance with the foundational principles of our legal system .

STATEMENTS OF FACT  
Below are the enumerated statements of fact  with no genuine dispute of material fact  
that entitle the Respondent to this Partial Summary Judgement:  
1. The Petitioner has not provided any evidence of Family Violence .⁶ These claims 
unjustly removed the Respondent from his home starting on January 16th, 2024  
and significantly impaired his at -home business operations , and are the basis for 
the current custodial arrangements  which are unlawful and founded on false 
claims.⁷ 
 
2. No basis exists for the current arrangements, as the Court has no t considered the 
best interests of the children throughout this case, but rather has operated solely 
on the accusations of family violence, which are now non -suited.⁸ 
 
3. The deadline approaching  March 1st to vacate,  and the current custodial 
arrangements are void of any lawful basis . Any custodial arrangements are 
required to consider  the best interests of the children involved . 
 
4. Respondent’s parenting plan has been overlooked by the Court, filed January 6th, 
2024.⁹ 
 
5. The Court’s basis for conservatorship was based solely on the claims of Family 
Violence, which are now void.  
 
6. The respondent is entitled to this Partial Summary Judgement as a matter of law, 
which will rightfully restore the status quo ante  given no genuine dispute of 
material fact exists regarding family violence, which are the basis for the ongoing 
and current orders.  
⁶ There exist no evidence supporting family violence on record, nullifying any custodial arrangements    
based on these foundational claims  alone . 
 
⁷ See attached EXHIBIT B . 
 
  ⁸ Attached EXHIBIT C, page 3. 
  ⁹ See attached EXHIBIT D, filed January 6th, 2024 , which better serve the children’s  best interests.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF  
WHEREFORE, Charles Dustin Myers, the Respondent herein, respectfully requests  this 
Honorable Court to:  
1. Annul the current temporary custody and visitation arrangements premised on 
allegations now proven to be baseless, taking into account the critical urgency 
imposed by the Respondent’s work -from -home requirements and the ongoing 
detriment to his familial re lationships.  
 
2. Recognize that the initial accusations of family violence, which underpinned 
the imposition of these temporary measures, were not substantiated by 
credible evidence. This failure has unjustly prejudiced the Respondent, 
undermining his right to an equitable  adjudication and rendering the imposed 
measures legally untenable.  
 
 
3. Acknowledge the absence of substantial evidence for the allegations levied 
against the Respondent. Command a thorough reevaluation of both procedural 
and substantive legal missteps observed in the prevailing proceedings, with a 
view to rectifying the inequ itable temporary orders that have adversely 
impacted the Respondent’s familial and professional life.  
 
4.  In accordance with Rule 166a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule 
60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, award relief predicated on 
identifiable mistakes, errors, and the conspicuous lack of evidential foundation 
for the accusations face d by the Respondent.  
 
 
5. Uphold Fairness and Due Process: Reorient the ongoing legal process to align 
strictly with the principles of fairness, due process, and the paramount 
interests of the children involved. This reorientation is essential to ensure the 
administration of justic e, uphold the Respondent’s inalienable right to a fair 
trial, and ameliorate the unwarranted disruptions to his familial life.  
 
6. Consideration of Respondent’s Efforts: Reflect on the substantial time and 
effort dedicated by the Respondent in pursuit of equitable treatment under the

law and the significant repercussions stemming from his unjust displacement  
based on allegations now demonstrated to be without merit.  
 
7. Reestablish the custodial and visitation status quo ante pending a lawful and 
unbiased reevaluation of the custody determination, ensuring that any future 
decisions are made in a manner that genuinely reflects the best interests of the 
children and respect s the due process rights of all parties involved.  
The Respondent avers that such relief is not only justified but imperative to rectify the 
injustices endured and to restore the integrity of this Court’s proceedings.  
Under penalty of perjury, I attest that the facts herein are true and accurate to the best of 
my knowledge and belief.  Pursuant to the Tarrant Local Rules, no conference between 
Counsel was required to be filed with this motion.
