The subsequent \ndismissal of the Protective Order suit not only vindicates the Respondent but also \ninvalidates the current custody orders, revealing that the initial award of custody was  \ngrounded solely in unsubstantiated claims of family violence. \u00b3 \n \nBACKGROUND  \nThe documents on record  filed by the Respondent , by virtue of their acceptance , \ninherently meet the threshold for self -authentication, thereby bolstering the legal \nfoundation for the requested partial Summary Judgment. Detailed herewith are the \nenumerated  facts underpinning this motion:  \n1. On December 14th, 2023, the Petitioner sought an EX -PARTE Order of \nProtection from the Court, which was judiciously denied, affirming the \nabsence of immediate threat or harm that warranted such an extraordinary \nmeasure. Undeterred by this judicial determin ation, the Petitioner proceeded \nto file for divorce on December 18th, 2023, misleadingly alleging the existence \nof an active Order of Protection against the Respondent. This deliberate \nmisrepresentation constitutes not merely an attempt to skew the legal p rocess \nin the Petitioner\u2019s favor but represents a flagrant abuse of the judicial system \ndesigned to secure an undue advantage in the divorce proceedings, which ha s \nultimately been successful.  \n \n2. On December 22nd, 2023, the Petitioner initiated a subsequent application for \na Protective Order, forming the cornerstone of litigation since the initial \nhearing on January 16th, 2024.  \n \n3. On January 16th, 2024, the Court  rendered Temporary Orders which required \nthe Respondent to vacate his family home and  give up custody of his children \non the presumption of family violence. The Court\u2019s decision did not meet the \nstatutory requirements of the Texas Family Code, Sec. 6.502. \u2074 \n \n\u00b3 The non-suit of the protective order entitles the Respondent to this Partial Summary Judgement as a \nmatter of law, as there is now no genuine dispute over the baselessness of the allegations made against \nhim which are the foundation of the current temporary orders in place.  \n\u2074 Sec. 6.502 mandates that a Court may make such a decision while a suit for dissolution of a marriage is \npending and on the motion of a party or on the court's own motion after notice and hearing . No hearing \ntook place, and no reasonable notice was given prior to the decision rendered on January 16th, 2024.   \n-2- \n\u00a0\u00a0  A CERTIFIED COPY  \n   ATTEST:   \n THOMAS A.

      "text": "4. On January 22nd, 2024, before the start of the reset hearing, the Petitioner   \nacquired legal counsel at the last minute, delaying the case further until the \nreset date of February 1st, 2024 . \n \n5. On February 1st, 2024, both parties entered into an agreement which allowed \nthe respondent back into the home on a temporary basis, yet still awarded the \nPetitioner with full custody of the children.  The Respondent was given 30 days \nper the agreement to remain in the home. Despite having the ability to stay \nnext door, and after dropping the Protective Suit that initiated and are the \nfoundation for this agreement , the Petitioner chose to stay with her friend 9 \nmiles away and remove the children from their stable environment . \n \n6. On February 5th, 2024, the Respondent discharged his Legal Counsel for failure \nto address any of the issues  mentioned herewith, and for failure to diligently \nrepresent the Respondent, as no genuine effort was made to make the court \naware of these errors.  The Protective Order suit was non -suited on this day, \ninvalidating the current agreement, and requiring by law that the Court reset \nthe case back to the status quo ante until a fair discovery process can be \nconducted on relevant matters to the divorce proceeding, and restoring order \nback into the lives of the Respondent and his Children.  \n \n7. The Petitioner's decision to reside outside the family home, despite alternatives \nthat would minimize disruption during this transitional period, is a deliberate \nchoice. This choice, made independently, should not facilitate the continuation \nof unfounded c laims that have since been dismissed. Such actions have unduly \ninfluenced the living arrangements and well -being of the children at the heart \nof this case . \n \n8. The Respondent explicitly refrains from pursuing any sanctions or penalties \nagainst the Petitioner, emphasizing instead a heartfelt plea for a reasonable \ntransition period. This adjustment period is advocated as crucial for \nsafeguarding the welfare of his children, himself, and the Petitioner, ensuring \ntheir collective long -term well -being. Furthermore, the Respondent \nunderscores that the prevailing custody determinations were unjustly \npredicated on unsubstantiated allegations of family violence \u2014a point \nunderscored by the unequivocal dismissal of the Protective Order, which \nconfirms the absence of any contested material facts . \n-3- \n\u00a0\u00a0  A CERTIFIED COPY  \n   ATTEST:   \n THOMAS A.

      "text": "LEGAL BASIS  \nThe legal foundation for this Partial Summary Judgment is firmly rooted in the principles \nand mandates of the law, notably where the current temporary orders are predicated on \nunsubstantiated claims of family violence, for which no concrete evidence has been \npresented. This lack of evidence fundamentally challenges the integrity and validity of \nthe orders affectin g the lives and welfare of the children involved. The necessity for the \ncourt to vacate these orders and revert to the status quo ante is underscored by the \nfollowing critical legal argument s: \n1 . Misalignment with Texas Family Code Sec. 105.001:   \n \n1.1 The orders issued on January 16th, 2024, and continued on January \n22nd, 2024, starkly conflict with Texas Family Code Sec. 105.001, which \nunequivocally necessitates notice and a hearing prior to the issuance of \nsuch orders. This statute ensures that partie s are given a fair opportunity to \nbe heard, a fundamental aspect of due process, which was conspicuously \nabsent in this case.  \n \n2. Contravention of Texas Family Code Sec. 105.005:  \n2.1 The initial rendering of temporary orders on January 16th, 2024, did \nnot adhere to Texas Family Code Sec. 105.005 , requiring that court's \nfindings be grounded in a preponderance of the evidence  before making \nany child custody determination affecting the parent -child relationship .  \n \n2.2 The absence of evidence from the Petitioner, juxtaposed with the \ndisregard for the Respondent's timely submissions, underscores a \nsignificant deviation from this legal requirement.  \n \n3. Violation of Texas Family Code Sec. 153.002:   \n \n3.1 The proceedings failed to prioritize \"The best interest of the child,\" as \nmandated by Texas Family Code Sec. 153.002. This principle, deemed \nparamount in determining issues of conservatorship, possession, and \naccess, was overlooked.  \n \n3.2 The Respondent's work -from-home situation and the need for a  \n-4- \n\u00a0\u00a0  A CERTIFIED COPY  \n   ATTEST:   \n THOMAS A.

Equal Opportunity and Fair Hearing (Sec. 152.205 & Sec. 105.003):  \n4.1 The Texas Family Code Sec. 152.205  and Sec. 105.003  enshrine the \nnecessity for equitable procedural rights, mandating that all parties are \ngranted a fair opportunity for notification and a meaningful hearing. The \nRespondent \u2019s ability to engage fully in the hearing process and to present a \ncomprehensive defense was significantly impeded, a deviation from the \ndue process envisaged by these statutes. Consequently, the temporary \norders issued lack the foundational fairness that i s central to the justice \nsystem and contravene the legal safeguards intended to ensure balanced \nparticipation by all parties in family law proceedings.  \n \n5. Managing Conservatorship Considerations (Sec. 153.005 & Sec. 153.007):  \n5.1 In deliberations of conservatorship, Texas Family Code Sec. 153.005 \nobligates the court to deliberate thoroughly on the child \u2019s best interest, \nincluding the living circumstances and stability provided by the parents. \nAdditionally, Sec. 153.007  advocates for the establishment of a mutually \nagreed parenting plan, prioritizing the child \u2019s welfare and the continuity of \ntheir established routine. The current  custodial provisions do not \ncorrespond with a collaboratively designed parenting plan that satisfies \nthese essential criteria. Given the disproven allegations of family violence \nand the unnecessary protective measures imposed during this period of \nchange, it is imperative for the Court to rescind these provisional measures. \nThe immediate restoration of the status quo ante is crucial to uphold the \nchildren \u2019s best interest, allowing for a planned and considerate period of \nadjustment that acknowledges the absence of any immediate risk or harm \nto their well -being  and without disruption to the Respondent\u2019s business \noperations at -home.  \n \n6. Rules of Dispositions for Family Law Cases \u2013 (Tarrant County Rules):  \n6.1 The provisions under Rule 4.02: Trial Procedures of the Tarrant Family \nRules , specifically Part 4  concerning the disposition of family law cases, \nhave been notably contravened in the ongoing proceedings of the.

Rule 60(b)  expressly allows for such relief \nunder conditions including, but not limited to, mistake, inadvertence, \nsurprise, excusable neglect, and most pertinently, fraud or \nmisrepresentatio n by an opposing party. Given the demonstrated lack of \nevidence supporting the allegations of family violence and the procedural \ndiscrepancies noted throughout the initiation and execution of these \ntemporary orders, it is imperative that the court immediately vacate the \ncurrent arrangements as their basis no longer exists . The circumstances \nsurrounding the issuance of these orders align with the instances wherein \nRule 60(b)  provides clear recourse for relief, underscoring the necessity for \ntheir immediate reevaluation to restore fairness and ensure justice is served \nin accordance with the foundational principles of our legal system . \n-6- \n\u00a0\u00a0  A CERTIFIED COPY  \n   ATTEST:   \n THOMAS A.
