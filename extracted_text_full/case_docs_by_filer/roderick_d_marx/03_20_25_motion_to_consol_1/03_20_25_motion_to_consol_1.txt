MOTION TO CONSOLIDATE 
 
This Motion to Consolidate the above lawsuits is brought by MORGAN MYERS, who 
shows in support: 
1. These lawsuits involve common questions of law or of fact as the parties have a 
current divorce case pending in the 322nd Judicial District Court, Cause No. 322 -744263-23.  
2. It would serve the convenience of the Court, litigants, and counsel and would 
avoid multiplicity of suits, duplication of testimony, and unnecessary expense and delay to have 
these lawsuits consolidated for trial. 
MORGAN MYERS prays that the Court grant the Motion to Consolidate and consolidate 
these lawsuits under the older and lower cause number. 
Respectfully submitted, 233-765358-25 FILED
