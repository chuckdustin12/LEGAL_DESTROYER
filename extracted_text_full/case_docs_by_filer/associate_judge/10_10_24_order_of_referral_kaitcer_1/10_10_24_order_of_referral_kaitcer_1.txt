NO. 322-744263-23 
IN THE 322ND DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
IN THE MATTER 
OF THE MARRIAGE OF 
MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS 
AND CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS 
AND IN THE INTEREST OF MARA 
MYERS AND CAROLINE MYERS, 
CHILDREN MOTION FOR RECUSAL 
TO THE HONORABLE DAVID EVANS 
OF THE 8TH ADMINISTRATIVE JUDICIAL REGION OF TEXAS: 
In February of 2018, response to a question posed by the Republican Club Political 
Action Committee, the now elected District Judge James Munford stated: 
"I'm running for this office because I've worked many, many years in the family law field. I want 
to help and work with the citizens of Tarrant County and the families of Tarrant County to 
provide a good and accurate judiciary that follows the rules of law." 
However, in this case, Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, has encountered a 
series of judicial determinations that fundamentally contradict this objective. The 
assurance to uphold a judiciary that follows the rule of law has been replaced with 
decisions that have deprived the Respondent of due process, equitable hearings, and his 
fundamental paternal rights. Respondent respectfully moves to recuse District Judge 
James Munford and Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer pursuant to TAC § 155.152 & TEX. 
R. CIV. P § 18b(b)(l) and in support thereof, states the following un-opposed facts: 
1

I. BASIS FOR RECUSAL 
A. The impartiality of a judge may be challenged in the trial court by a motion to 
recuse. TEX. R. CIV. P. 18a, 18b. The Respondent respectfully moves to recuse Honorable 
Judge James Munford and Honorable Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer from presiding over 
cause number 322-744263-231 for their collective inability to remain impartial in this 
matter by depriving the Respondent of a fair trial on four separate appearances. "Texas 
requires the recusal of a judge in any case where his or her impartiality might reasonably 
be questioned, regardless of any actual bias which may be held in a case." Aguilar v. 
Anderson., 855 S.W.2d 799, 815. 
B. This motion has been filed at the earliest practicable opportunity, as the 
Respondent has exhausted all other available legal avenues without receiving any response, 
explanation, or opposition. Respondent has given the trial court every opportunity to 
correct the errors made in this case and has recently discovered pertinent information 
related to the initial proceeding that took place on January 16th, 2024, as outlined below. 
There are no current settings or upcoming hearings, and the case has not yet been scheduled 
for a final trial. The Respondent's motion is verified and asserts grounds for recusal 
pursuant to TEX. CIV. R. P. 18(b )b 1. These grounds are not predicated solely on the judges' 
prior rulings. Instead, this motion presents detailed, particularized facts based on the 
Respondent's direct knowledge that are admissible as evidence and are self-authenticating 
1 This case was consolidated on January 1611\ 2024, by District Judge James Munford with cause number 
322-744538-23, a protective order suit initiated by the Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers. 
2

under Rule 902( 4) of the Texas Rules of Evidence and are sufficient to warrant recusal. 
Moreover, where facts are presented based on information and belief, the foundation for 
such beliefs is explicitly stated. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 18a(a)(l)-(4); 18a(b)(l) 
II. QUESTIONING THE IMPARTIALITY OF JAMES MUNFORD 
A. On September 29th, 2024, the Respondent discovered a Facebook post made by 
the Tarrant County District Courts which stated the following: 
"The following Tarrant County District Courts will be closed tomorrow, Tuesday, January 16, 
2024. 
This list is evolving as individual Judges are making informed decisions based on their dockets, 
inclement weather, and the safety and welfare of litigants, Court staff, counsel, and the general 
public." -Tarrant County District Courts on January 15, 2024. 
The Fort Worth Independent School District also announced that they would remain 
closed due to inclement weather in the area. https:/lwww.fox4news.com/news/dallas-fort­
worth-school-closings-;an-l 6. On December 14th, 2024, the petitioner requested a 
protective order from James Munford, which was denied. Exhibit A. However, one month 
and two days later, Judge James Munford made an initial decision that has been 
unexplained for the last ten months. 
B. The initial decision at issue arose during a show cause hearing concerning an 
order of protection initiated by the petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, on December 22, 
2023. This hearing was originally scheduled to be presided over by Associate Judge 
Jeffrey Kaitcer in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County at 9:00 A.M. on January 16th, 
2024. However, due to delays caused by inclement weather as mentioned above, the 
3

proceedings were instead conducted by District Judge James Munford, as Associate 
Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer arrived late. 
C. Both parties were present and appeared without legal representation. During the 
proceedings, Judge Munford presented the parties with an agreed continuance, which 
both parties accepted, and which was subsequently granted by Judge Munford as 
reflected in his order. However, despite granting the continuance, Judge Munford went 
further, issuing a series of rulings where he sua sponte consolidated the protective order 
case with the divorce case previously filed by the petitioner on December 18, 2023. 
Exhibit B. He ordered the Respondent to vacate the residency that same day by 2:00 p.m., 
divested him of the custody of his children, and the hearing was then rescheduled for 
January 22, 2024, to be presided over by Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer. Exhibit C. 
D. This decision by Judge Munford undeniably raises serious questions regarding 
his impartiality in this matter. Due process of law requires that an individual receive 
notice and hearing before being deprived of a property right. In re the Guardianship of 
Bays, 355 S.W.3d 715, 720 (Tex. App. 2011); See Grannis v. Ordean, 234 U.S. 385,394, 
34 S. Ct. 779, 783, 58 L. Ed. 1363 (1914) ("a fundamental requisite of due process oflaw 
is the opportunity to be heard"). Furthermore, the Texas Family Code prohibits such an 
order before notice and hearing. TEX. FAM. CODE 105.001 (" ... an order may not be 
rendered under Subsection (a)(l) ... except after notice and a hearing ... ") (referencing 
child custody). 
4

E. Moreover, 6.405(b) of the Texas Family Code was not satisfied, which is a 
mandatory requirement before any hearing can take place given the original petition for 
divorce claimed an active order of protection was currently in effect against the 
Respondent. Exhibit B, p. 7. ("The petitioner shall attach to the petition a copy of each 
order described by Subsection (a)(l) in which a party to the suit or the child of a party to 
the suit was the applicant or victim of the conduct alleged in the application ... if a copy 
of the order is not available at the time of filing, the petition must state that a copy of the 
order will be filed with the court before any hearing.) All of the procedural safeguards 
above were disregarded by James Munford. 
F. The purpose of temporary orders with injunctive relief is not to destroy the 
status quo, but rather to preserve it. See Iranian Muslim Organization v. City of San 
Antonio, 615 S.W.2d 202, 208 (Tex. 1981); Davis v. Huey, 571 S.W.2d 859, 862 (Tex. 
1978); Citizens of Texas Sav. v. Fox Jacobs, 718 S.W.2d 2, 3 (Tex. App. 1985). Similarly 
to how the temporary injunction in Coyote Lake Ranch, LLC v. City of Lubbock, 498 
S.W.3d 53 (Tex. 2016) improperly denied the City its undisputed right to access 
groundwater-an essential resource-Judge Munford's rulings have deprived the 
Respondent of his residency, which has served not only as the family home since 2015 
but also as the headquarters for his business which provided for the children -an 
essential resource to their wellbeing. Furthermore, the Respondent was divested of 
custodial rights to his children without justification. Like the injunction in Coyote, rather 
than preserving the status quo, these initial rulings have done the opposite by depriving 
5

the Respondent of his constitutional rights to property prior to due process of law. US 
CONST. AMEND XIV,§ 1; TEX CONST. ART. I,§ 19. Furthermore, James Munford 
prejudged critical matters that require full evidentiary hearings. TEX. FAM. CODE 
105.00l(b) ( ... an order may not be rendered under Subsection (a)(l), (2), or (5) except 
after notice and a hearing.) (in regard to the temporary conservatorship for a child, for the 
temporary support of the child, or for payment of attorney's fees.) 
G. The Respondent's burden of showing of bias or impartiality to such an extent 
that the movant was deprived of a fair trial is satisfied from Judge Munford's initial 
ruling. See Rodriguez v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., No. 04-14-00342-CV, 22 (Tex. 
App. Jun. 17, 2015). 
H. The threshold for recusal is "whether a reasonable member of the public at 
large, knowing all the facts in the public domain concerning the judge's conduct, would 
have a reasonable doubt that the judge is actually impartial." Hansen v. JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A., 346 S.W.3d 769, 776 (Tex. App.-Dallas 2011, no pet.); Rodriguez v. 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., No. 04-14-00342-CV, 22 (Tex. App. Jun. 17, 2015). The 
Respondent asserts that a reasonable member of the public would indeed reasonably 
doubt James Munford was actually impartial given that he deprived the Respondent of a 
fair trial. Thus, the Respondent's burden and threshold for recusal has been met, and 
Judge James Munford should be recused from this matter. 
I. The only reasoning provided was an oral statement regarding his personal 
opinion regarding the Respondent living next door to his ex-partner's grandparents, 
6

which is extrajudicial and comes from a biased perspective which discounted the facts of 
the case relevant to the children's well-being. In the context of this case, recusal is 
warranted if the trial judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned, or he has a 
personal bias. TEX. R. CIV. P. l 8b(2). This opinion or bias was irrelevant to the well 
being of the children, as the grandmother, much like the children, relied on the 
Respondent's income in order to provide financial stability, and further justifies his 
recusal. 
III. QUESTIONING THE IMPARTIALITY OF JEFFREY KAITCER 
A. The initial ruling reset the case to January 22nd, 2024. The Respondent retained 
the services of Dan Bacalis, while the Petitioner arrived without any legal representation 
and retained the services of Cooper Carter in the lobby of the courtroom. Much like the 
first setting, Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer granted a continuance which only benefitted 
the petitioner by allowing her legal representation more time to become familiar with the 
case while simultaneously extending the initial orders of Judge James Munford to 
February I st, 2024, which significantly impacted the Respondent and his children. Exhibit 
D. Neither party appeared before the Jeffrey Kaitcer, and this decision was made without 
any input from the Respondent and without any opportunity to contest it. 
B. At the third trial setting on February 1, 2024, the parties arrived only to be 
presented with a settlement agreement from the Respondent's own counsel. Given that 
the case had been delayed twice already and the ongoing damage from being unable to 
work at full capacity was compounding by the day, the Respondent contested this 
7

strategy. He was informed by his attorney that the orders could be modified later and was 
urged to sign it. Left with no better alternative, the Respondent signed the agreement 
under duress after already being deprived of his residency, children, and business since 
January 161\ 2024. Exhibit E 
C. The agreement removed the children from their own home that they had resided 
in their entire life and allowed the Respondent back into the home until March 1, 2024. It 
also established child support, and allocated financial responsibilities to the parties, to 
where the Respondent was left with both car payments, an unreasonable amount of time 
to transition from the home and with the addition of child support obligations. Exhibit E 
D. Due to the Respondent's counsel drafting a settlement agreement rather than 
representing the interests of his client, he was terminated shortly after the third setting on 
February 5, 2024, where the Respondent began to represent himself prose. Exhibit F He 
filed a motion to reconsider the associate judge's report for temporary orders on February 
9, 2024, which wasn't set for hearing until March 14 due to unnecessary delay by the 
opposing counsel, Cooper Carter, who has not filed any pleadings in this case on behalf 
of the petitioner. Exhibit G 
E. Given that Dan Bacalis had been terminated, and that the associate judge's 
report signed on February 1, 2024, had clear stipulations regarding its' reduction to 
writing Exhibit G, p.5, the Respondent filed notice with the court on March 4th, 2024, 
stating that he would not be leaving the marital residence as it was not in the best 
interests of his children. Exhibit H 
8

F. This decision prompted the petitioner to run inside the family residence on 
March 6th, 2024, while the Respondent was walking his daughters to school on her 
visitation time and lock the petitioner out of the home. Since this day, the Respondent has 
pursued relief to no avail, without argument, and without any response or findings of 
facts from either judge or Cooper Carter, petitioner's counsel. 
G. On March 14, 2024, the parties appeared before Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer 
to address the Respondent's motion to reconsider. Just minutes prior to the hearing, the 
Respondent was served formally reduced temporary orders by Cooper L. Carter, which 
contained significant clerical discrepancies and deviated from the original orders signed 
on February 1, 2024. These orders are currently in effect today as 'agreed orders'. Exhibit 
I. The orders also reference a hearing that was never conducted in this case. 
H. During the hearing, the Respondent was precluded from addressing the events 
leading up to February 1, 2024, due to sustained objections based on relevance. Despite 
signing off on the Associate Judge's Report which non-suited the protective order, the 
opposing counsel was nonetheless permitted to elicit testimony from their client 
regarding her purported fear for safety should Respondent be allowed near the residency, 
which has not been supported by any evidence to date. 
I. Judge Kaitcer refused to admit the Respondent's exhibits, which included 
affidavits from business clients prepared to attest to his need for residency and his close 
relationship with his daughters. Exhibit J. Judge Kaitcer further stated in open court, 
while drafting his ruling on the Respondent's motion, "You don't care about your kids. 
9

You just care about your business." This remark, devoid of any evidentiary basis, exposed 
a deep-seated bias that rendered impartial adjudication impossible. A neutral and 
impartial evaluator would have acknowledged the interconnected nature of the 
Respondent's business, residency, and familial relationships as well as the impact of the 
initial proceedings leading up to that point. Further, an impartial judge would have 
realized that there is no logical explanation to remove a parent who relies on the 
residency to provide for the children while simultaneously denying the evidence that 
would have corroborated this need. 
J. The Respondent's motion for reconsideration concluded with an illegible order, 
requiring him to sign the temporary orders served just moments earlier by 1 :30 p.m. that 
same day. Exhibit K. Again, the order was designated as "agreed" despite lacking the 
Respondent's signature, was reduced outside of its' own procedural requirements ordered 
by the same judge, was reduced without any underlying motion for temporary orders ever 
served to the Respondent and differed from the associate judge's report signed on 
February 1, 2024. Rather than holding the opposing counsel and the petitioner in 
contempt for violating Rule 13 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure for signing a 
fictitious pleading which contained false statements, Jeffrey Kaitcer deprived the 
Respondent of a fair trial, thus warranting his recusal from this matter. 
K. It is evident, based on common sense and objective evaluation of the public 
facts regarding Jeffrey Kaitcer's conduct that no reasonable person would believe that he 
was actually impartial knowing all of the facts of the case. After eight months of seeking 
10

relief throughout the Texas judiciary, the collective actions of Judge James Munford and 
Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer remain unexplained, and the damage is ongoing. Their 
joint recusal is necessary to ensure a fair resolution of this matter and to ensure the 
persistent favoritism directed towards the petitioner is abolished. 
IV. THE AFTERMATH 
A. Since the March 14th hearing, the case has stalled. There has been no 
participation from the opposing party, and all attempted communications have failed. 
There hasn't been any explanation for the denials in the Second Court of Appeals, leaving 
the Respondent to continue seeking every remedy available to him to correct the 
decisions presented above or receive a valid legal basis that justifies them. 
B. The joint managing conservatorship that the current orders outline has put the 
Respondent in massive amounts of debt. He had to stay in hotels on Thursday nights in 
order to take his Children to school on Friday mornings for his visitation period, and for 
the extended summer visitation, rented an AIR BNB in order to provide the Children with 
a stable living space. The Respondent was able to have the owner of the AIRBNB located 
at 6608 Dewsbury St. that was only 1.3 miles from the Respondent's home allow him to 
port forward the router, allowing him to work to some degree, where he stayed until 
September 141\ 2024. Given the requirements to operate his business, an alternative 
residency would take a fair amount of time to transition to, and likewise the petitioner 
would need equal amount of time to obtain full employment in order to maintain the 
11

current household. All of this was explained in the Respondent's pleadings that were 
before the court on January 16th, 2024, but were not considered. Exhibit L, Exhibit M 
C. Since the March 14th hearing, the petitioner has moved additional family 
members into the home, has not paid rent, and has reduced her employment while 
significantly reducing the Respondents. On top of both James Munford and Jeffrey 
Kaitcer's disregard for the law and the best interests of the children, the inadvertent 
favoritism towards the petitioner has allowed her to further her own interests at the 
expense of the status quo of the children. An impartial judge is required in this matter to 
ensure that this one-sided favoritism does not continue at the expense of the children. 
D. On June 2 of 2024, the petitioner's grandmother contacted the Respondent 
reiterating the above. She stated that the children were not being taken care of, that the 
petitioner was not acting like herself, and that she was not paying rent. This information 
was relayed to the Supreme Court of Texas, where the Respondent's motion for rehearing 
on petition for writ of mandamus is still pending before the court, asking them to compel 
James Munford to vacate the current orders which were entered by Associate Judge 
Jeffrey Kaitcer as agreed without consent and referenced a hearing that has never taken 
place. 
V. QUESTIONS THAT REMAIN UNANSWERED 
Throughout this case, several concerning questions have arisen regarding the conduct 
of both judges: 
12

1. What dire circumstance compelled Judge James Munford to take up a case on 
short notice and grant injunctions and make child custody decisions without 
knowing the facts or considering the pleadings, particularly on a day the court was 
closed due to inclement weather when he had denied a similar request a month 
earlier? 
2. Why did Judge Munford grant an agreed continuance at a protective order hearing 
and simultaneously rule against one of the parties on divorce issues without taking 
into consideration the preponderance of the evidence before him? 
3. What factual basis on the record compelled Jeffrey Kaitcer to openly make 
negative statements about the Respondent regarding his children? 
4. Why has Cooper Carter failed to respond to any of the Respondent's pleadings and 
neglected to file any documents on behalf of her client? 
5. What factual basis exists on the record to supports the petitioner being granted full 
custody of the children and sole use of the residence? 
6. How can an order be issued as an "agreed order" after consent was explicitly 
withdrawn, referencing a hearing that never occurred, and served to the 
Respondent before a scheduled hearing meant to challenge the very order? 
13

VI. CONCLUSION 
This case, as detailed in the pending motion for rehearing before the Supreme 
Court of Texas, revolves around the core issue of accountability. What began with 
Morgan Michelle Myers attempting to avoid responsibility has now evolved into a 
troubling scenario where both judges have repeatedly failed to recognize and correct their 
serious missteps. Attorney Cooper Carter's authority to represent the petitioner, currently 
being challenged through a Rule 12 motion, further deepens concerns about the integrity 
and fairness of these proceedings. 
Recusing both judges is not just a procedural necessity, but a crucial step toward 
ensuring that this case is reviewed impartially and that the facts are properly considered. 
This will allow the court to focus on the petitioner's pattern of deception and, more 
importantly, what truly serves the best interests of the children. The petitioner's actions 
have caused unnecessary delays, destabilized her family, and inflicted significant 
emotional and financial harm on all involved. The ongoing litigation, exacerbated by a 
lack of judicial transparency and accountability, has only added to the hardship. 
Despite these issues, the Respondent holds no ill will toward any party involved. 
His primary concern has always been, and continues to be, doing what is right for his 
children. The Respondent believes that with impartial judges and a renewed focus on 
fairness, this case can still be resolved justly, allowing all parties to move forward with 
dignity and integrity. The Respondent remains diligent in his commitment to securing a 
fair outcome that reflects the best interests of his children as the Family Code mandates. 
14

VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF 
The Respondent respectfully requests the following relief: 
1. That the clerk of the court deliver a copy of the motion for recusal to both the 
respondent judges and the regional presiding judge, and deliver any signed orders 
of recusal or referral to the regional presiding judge immediately upon filing. 
2. That the respondent judges either recuse themselves or refer the motion to the 
regional presiding judge within three business days after the motion is filed, and 
refrain from taking any further action in the case until the motion is decided, 
unless good cause is shown in writing or on the record. 
3. That the regional presiding judge issue interim orders to reset the status quo by 
allowing the Respondent's immediate return to his home and business, thereby 
initiating a peaceful transitionary period for the family's well-being and stability. 
4. That the motion for recusal be conducted by telephone, as permitted by Rule 
18(g)(6)(C), to expedite the process and ensure all documents submitted by 
facsimile or email, if otherwise admissible under the rules of evidence, are 
considered. 
5. That, if the motion is granted, the regional presiding judge reassign the case to 
another court or assign another judge to ensure fairness and impartiality moving 
forward. 
15

The Respondent seeks this relief to ensure that the case proceeds in a just manner, 
restoring stability and allowing a fair resolution to the matter at hand during the pendency 
of the case.

4. As outlined in the Joint Motion for Recusal, I have encountered judicial 
determinations in this case that have deprived me of due process, equitable 
hearings, and my fundamental parental rights. The decisions rendered by both 
Judge Munford and Judge Kaitcer have caused significant harm to my ability to 
maintain stability for my children and have compounded my financial hardship. 
18

5. I have attempted to address these concerns through all available legal avenues, yet 
I have received no adequate response or resolution. The continued judicial 
favoritism towards the petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, has resulted in undue 
hardship on me and my children, destabilizing our lives both emotionally and 
financially. 
6. I attest that all facts presented in the Joint Motion for Recusal are true and accurate 
based on my personal experience and knowledge. I have made every effort to act 
in the best interests of my children throughout these proceedings, and I believe 
that the recusal of both judges is necessary for an impartial review of this case. 
7. I further attest that the petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, has knowingly made 
fals_e statements and misrepresented facts in order to benefit herself in these 
proceedings, which has inadvertently caused harm to our children. These false 
statements have contributed to the current instability and emotional distress they 
are experiencing. I affirm that all statements made herein regarding the welfare of 
the children are true, accurate, and made under penalty of perjury. 
8. I also affirm that my return to the family residence will be conducted with 
amicable honor and respect for all involved. I will take every step necessary to 
ensure a peaceful and respectful environment, with no conflict or disruptions. 
While residing in the home temporarily, I will pursue alternative living 
arrangements, allowing for a smooth transition, all while preserving the status quo 
for the sake of the children and their well-being.

IN THE 322nd DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY 
STATE OF TEXAS 
Morgan Michelle Myers, 
Petitioner, 
V. 
Charles Dustin Myers, 
Respondent Cause No. 322-744263-23 
Emergency Motion to Reconsider 
Evidence and to Vacate Temporary 
Orders 
This motion urgently calls for the Court's intervention to address critical procedural 
missteps in the matter of cause# 322-744263-23, aiming to reinstate the safety and stability 
that our children rightfully deserve until due process and all facts of the case can be considered 
by the Court. I am seeking immediate court intervention to correct procedural errors and 
address the misuse of the legal system by the Petitioner. This motion highlights the significant 
impact of the Petitioner's actions on our children's welfare and my unjust removal from our 
home based on frivolous claims. 
In pursuit of justice and the well-being of the children at heart, I respectfully request that 
the Court reconsider all details, weighing the comprehensive scenario presented herein along 
with the supporting evidence. I am committed to the highest interests of my children and 
family, striving to resolve these matters efficiently and avoid unnecessary judicial expenditure. 
This document seeks to unveil the Petitioner's deliberate misrepresentation and misuse of the 
legal system, which has gravely disrupted our children's stability and emotional well-being by 
weaponizing the court system. 
1 On December 1st, 2023, the Petitioner announced her desire for a divorce with no plan in place to preserve our 
familial stability, with no desire for counseling or communication, and with no consideration of the timing around 
the holiday season, nor any sign of marital discord warranting such a decision leading up to this announcement. 
2 Between December 14th, 2023, and December 22nd, 2023, the Petitioner filed for an Emergency Protective 
Order, a Divorce Petition, a Protective Order, and instigated an Eviction suit.

NATURE OF SUITS AND THIRD-PARTY INFLUENCE 
1. On December l5t, 2023, Petitioner announced the divorce with no plan in place for the 
children, no sign of marital discord leading up to this point to warrant such a decision, 
and no desire for counseling, communication, and no consideration for the time of year. 
2. Between December l51, 2023, and December 12th, 2023, all efforts are exhausted in an 
attempt to communicate with the Petitioner which lead to the subsequent discovery of an 
alarming volume of text messages that were directed towards two individuals -Debbie 
Price and Darnen Kazlauskas, showing a significant level of influence.3 
3. On December 12th, 2023, After the discovery of the communications between these two 
individuals combined with the irrational behavior from the Petitioner during such a 
critical time of year, I reached out to the Petitioner's grandfather via text message. 4 
4. On December 13th, 2023, Petitioner states she will be going to talk to her Grandparents 
alone. This conversation lasts between 9:55 and 1:30 A.M. 
5. On December 14th, 2023, Petitioner filed for an Emergency Protective Order. This order 
was denied by the court. 
6. On December 15th, 2023, Petitioner involves her family into the situation. 
Particularly, Dan Branthoover became involved. He is the boyfriend of the Petitioner's 
Mother. Shortly thereafter, I received a notice from our joint bank account stating that 
$1,576 had just been withdrawn. As our bank statement for December 2023 will 
demonstrate -the transaction record shows the funds being transferred directly to Mr. 
Branthoover's Pay Pal account. 5 
3 See attached EXHIBIT A.1 - A true and accurate copy of the AT&T text logs filtered by relevant parties. Parties 
include Meme, Papaw, Darnen, Debbie, and Dan. Dates and times surrounding the case will corroborate with other 
evidence presented herein. See page 456 -458.

7. On December 16th, 2023, Petitioner's transaction under the advice of Mr. Branthoover 
lead to our joint bank account becoming $-800 overdrawn. I requested from Mr. 
Branthoover via text message that he needs to return the funds immediately, where he 
subsequently admits to this transaction having occurred. 6 
8. On December 17th, 2023, Petitioner's grandmother, Margie Wilson, initiates an Eviction 
Suit by serving me an eviction notice around 11 :00 AM CST. 
9. On December 18th, 2023 -Petitioner writes "VOID" on the Eviction Notice, and 
physically tears it in half. 7 
10. On December 19th, 2023, Mr. Branthoover uses intimidation tactics by impersonating an 
attorney despite having no license to practice law in the State of Texas. 8 
11. On December 27th, 2023, I am served the Divorce Papers by the Constable. 
12. On December 28th, 2023, I am served the Protective Order, followed by the Eviction 
shortly thereafter by the Constable. 
The Protective Order (Show Cause) hearing was set for January 16th, 2024, and the Eviction 
hearing for January 17th, 2024. 
The documented timeline of events, particularly during the holiday season, underscores a 
notable disregard for our children's welfare. This has enabled the Petitioner to inappropriately 
utilize the judicial system to disrupt the stable environment our children have known, 
influenced significantly by third-party actions as previously detailed. The forthcoming section of 
this motion will highlight the specific frivolous claims and false statements found within each 
filing initiated by the Petitioner.

7 See attached EXHIBIT A.5 -The physically tom and voided Eviction notice served on December 17th, 2023.

FRIVOLOUS CLAIMS AND FALSE STATEMENTS 
A. EMERGENCY PROTECTIVE ORDER 
1. As mentioned above, Petitioner filed for an Emergency Protective Order on 
December 14th, 2023. This protective order was denied by the courts. 
2. Due to the fact this order was not granted by the court, one could conclude that 
there was not a clear and present danger of family violence.1 
B. THE DIVORCE PETITION 
1. Petition was filed on 2024-12-18 under an Affidavit of Inability to pay.2 
2. The Petitioner's action of filing for divorce under an Affidavit of Inability to pay 
three days after transferring $1,576 to herself starkly contravenes the mandates 
set forth in Chapter 10, Section 10.001 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code. This 
section asserts that each claim or legal contention must be warranted by existing 
law or a nonfrivolous argument for the modification of existing law or the 
establishment of new law, and that each factual contention has or is likely to have 
evidentiary support after further investigation or discovery3• 
3. The Petitioner violated Chapter 10, Section 10.001 a second time within the 
same document when she intentionally elected to waive the 60-day waiting 
period claiming to have an active protective order against me that found family 
violence had occurred during our marriage4 despite being denied such an order 
just five days prior on December 14th, 2023. 
5. The final page of the Divorce Petition for service to the Office of the Attorney 
General was left unsigned by the Petitioner.

2 See attached EXHIBIT B.l -A True and Accurate copy of the Divorce Petition for all references made in regard to

3 CML PRACTICE AND REMEDIES CODE, TITLE 2, SUBTITLE A, CHAPTER 10, Sec. 10.001. 
4 TEXAS FAMILY CODE, Sec. 6.405 -The petitioner shall attach to the petition a copy of each order described by 
Subsection (a)(l). No such order, as required, was attached to the divorce petition, because no such order exists.

C. EVICTION SUIT 
1. The suit was unlawful by natures, as the grounds for eviction were based on 
family status, referencing the divorce as well as a protective order that had been 
denied on December 14th, 2023. The suit was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction on 
January 17th, 2024. 6 
D. PROTECTIVE ORDER 
1. This suit was the second attempt by the Petitioner to have me removed from 
the home, which ultimately succeeded. 
2. The claims within this suit mentioned sexually aggressive comments and 
threatening behavior. These allegations are materially false, as the Petitioner 
possesses no evidence, and has presented no evidence in relation to these claims 
since the initiation of the suit. Despite this, as video and image evidence will show 
once a fair trial date is set, the Petitioner and I continued to maintain stability at 
our family home and preserved the sense of normalcy that our daughters have 
been accustomed to their entire lives up until January 16th, 2024. 
The Court's decision to remove me from my home and my children's lives on January 
16th, 2024, albeit preliminary and unjustified, bypassed the safeguarding of the children's 
emotional, psychological, and physical well-being. This oversight is compounded by the 
Petitioner's actions. The juxtaposition of the Court's decision against the backdrop of the 
Petitioner's inattention to the children's needs illuminates a disconcerting disregard for the 
paramount principle that custody determinations should primarily serve the children's best 
interests. The final section of this motion will highlight the procedural aspects of the events 
unfolding between the dates of January 16th, 2024, and February l5t, 2024, and pray the court 
will rectify this situation by restoring the stability to our family by vacating the current 
temporary orders that are in place until a proper investigation can be completed by the courts.

THE PROTECTIVE ORDER HEARINGS 
1. In preparation for the Protective Order hearing on January 161h, 2024, I filed with the 
Court an answer to the Protective Order on January 2nd, 2024 as well as two motions - a 
motion to consolidate the divorce with the protective order, filed on January 41h, 2024, as 
well as a motion of continuance, filed on January 81h, 2024 for the purpose to acquire 
counsel due to the complex nature of the case.1 All three filings were accepted by the 
court. 
2. On January 16th, 2024, both parties sought additional time to secure legal 
representation. Despite not reviewing any evidence, witness testimonies, or documents 
related to the motions, and acknowledging the denial of a previous Emergency Protective 
Order, the court mandated my departure from our home within four hours. This 
decision, unexpectedly made, awarded custody to the Petitioner, overlooking my 
concerns about the adverse effects on our children and my work from home. This ruling, 
which both parties did not sign, set the case to resume on January 22nd, 2024, to allow 
time for obtaining counsel. 2 
3. Following the court's directive, I relocated to my father's residence in Flower Mound until 
the subsequent hearing. During this interval, the Petitioner did not take the initiative to 
have the children call once and did not provide any information as to how they were 
doing, showcasing her lack of empathy and concern for our children's well-being and 
stability. After incurring substantial expenses to secure representation, I detailed my case 
and concerns to my attorney, preparing for the next court appearance. 
4. On January 22nd, 2024, the Petitioner chose to seek legal representation just minutes 
before the hearing was due to start, indicating a disregard for the process. My lawyer 
recommended agreeing to a continuance, thereby extending the period I couldn't work 
and impacting our established family dynamics. This resulted in a third hearing being set 
for February 1st, coinciding with my birthday, and a second rendition being ordered. 3 
1 See attached EXHIBIT C.1 -A true and accurate copies of all referenced filings in paragraph 1. 
2 See attached EXHIBIT C.2 - A true and accurate copy of the unsigned rendition ordered on January 161\ 2024.

5. On February 1st, 2024, during the third hearing, the substantive issues I had raised were 
not addressed, nor was there any exchange of evidence between our legal representatives. 
Despite the focus of the hearing supposed to be on the protective order, the discussions 
veered into custody and child support matters. My lawyer presented the sole option of a 
temporary return to the family home for 30 days with expanded visitation rights, coupled 
with a child support obligation starting in April. This outcome, which diverged significantly 
from the case's core issues, compelled me to reconsider my legal representation. 
Consequently, I decided to terminate my attorney's services and embarked on drafting this 
motion myself, aiming to bring the court's attention back to the pivotal elements of the case 
that had thus far been neglected while able to legally reside in my home. 
CONCLUSION AND PRAYER 
In conclusion, this motion has laid bare the stark realities and procedural aberrations that have 
marred the essence of justice and due process in the matter of Cause No. 322-744263-23. 
Through the course of these proceedings, it has become abundantly clear that the actions taken 
by the Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, have not only disregarded the welfare and best 
interests of our children but have also illuminated her unfitness as a parent. Her actions speak 
to a pattern of deceit, manipulation, and an unsettling willingness to leverage the judicial 
system for personal vendettas, all at the expense of the emotional and psychological well-being 
of our children. 
The court, in its decisions, inadvertently facilitated this troubling trajectory by removing me, 
Charles Dustin Myers, from the lives of our children based on unsubstantiated claims and 
without due consideration of my role as a devoted and stable parent. This oversight has not 
only disrupted the lives of our children but has also significantly impaired my ability to provide 
for them, casting a long shadow over their future stability and welfare. 
Moreover, the conduct of my Counsel involved has further compounded these issues, 
demonstrating a distressing disregard for the intricate dynamics and facts of this case. This has 
culminated in a situation where the paramount importance of the children's best interests and 
the fundamental principles of fairness and justice have been overshadowed by procedural 
missteps and a lack of thorough investigation into the Petitioner's fitness as a parent.

••••••••

Therefore, it is with a heavy hearted yet unwavering resolve that I implore the Court to take 
immediate and decisive action to rectify these wrongs. Specifically, I respectfully request the 
Court to: 
1. Vacate the existing temporary orders that unjustly removed me from my home and 
separated me from my children, restoring the status quo ante until a thorough and 
unbiased evaluation of the facts can be conducted, as the Texas Constitution requires. If 
left as it stands, these orders will further compound the issues at hand, and will 
exacerbate the chaos introduced into the children's lives. 
2. Set a fair hearing date to delve into the substantive issues at hand, ensuring that all 
parties are given an equitable opportunity to present their case and that the best 
interests of our children are placed at the forefront of all considerations. 
3. Scrutinize any response or new claims from the Petitioner or her counsel with the utmost 
diligence, given the established pattern of deceitful and manipulative behavior exhibited 
by the Petitioner throughout these proceedings. 
4. Consider awarding me full custody of our children, ensuring their continued access to a 
stable, nurturing environment, and the consistent provision of their needs, which I am 
fully committed to upholding. Furthermore, in alignment with my enduring belief in the 
importance of both parents in the lives of our children, I pledge to facilitate and 
encourage a healthy, constructive relationship between the children and their mother, 
provided she demonstrates a genuine commitment to their well-being and stability. 
5. In seeking these remedies, I do so not out of vindictiveness but from a place of deep 
concern for the welfare of our children and a steadfast belief in the principles of justice 
and fairness. Despite the pain and turmoil of these proceedings, my ultimate desire is for 
peace and the best possible outcome for all parties involved, most importantly, our 
children. It is my sincere hope that the Court will recognize the gravity of the situation 
and act in a manner that prioritizes the well-being of our children, ensuring their return 
to a life marked by stability and love. 
I affirm under penalty of perjury that all claims herein are true and accurate to the best of my 
knowledge. 
Respectfully submitted on this 9th day of February 2024,

NOTICE AND UNSWORN DECLARATION 
Charles Dustin Myers, 
Respondent 
March 3, 2024 
Dear Clerk of the Court, 
This letter is submitted on behalf of the Respondent in the above-referenced case to 
provide the court with an update on the Respondent's efforts to uphold the well-being of 
the children under the current agreed arrangements pending review and to navigate the 
complexities of this case. The following reasons why it is impossible for the Respondent 
to vacate the family home under the current agreement pending review are as follows: 
1. Since the inception of the case, the Respondent's primary focus has been to reset 
the status quo ante for the benefit of the children, ensuring their lives remain as 
normal and uninterrupted as possible during this transitory period after it was 
significantly disrupted beginning on January 16th, 2024. Despite the challenges 
posed by the non-suited protective order and the dropped allegations of family 
violence which were the foundations of all decisions made within this case, the 
Respondent has respected the orders pending review, and has strived to provide a 
stable and supportive environment for his children during his designated time, all 
while planning a transition that best suits his children. 
2. During the short amount of time the Respondent has been re-instated to his home, 
the Petitioner has, on multiple occasions, entered the residence unannounced and 
without prior consent, actions which stand in stark contrast to her prior requests 
for protection which have governed this case.

3. The Petitioner has changed employers since the signing of the agreement. 
4. Petitioner has relinquished custody of the children to the Respondent on multiple 
days during her scheduled time, showcasing the Respondent's ability to care for 
his children at any time given his at-home work schedule specifically crafted to 
ensure participation in every aspect of his children's lives remains possible. 
5. The Respondent must dedicate substantial time to researching and understanding 
legal procedures to ensure compliance with court rules and to advocate effectively 
for the best interests of his children. He is prepared to present all relevant facts 
and evidence at the upcoming hearing on March 14th, should his partial summary 
judgment not be accepted. 
6. The Respondent has made efforts over the past 30 days to maintain normalcy for 
his children, showcasing his dedication to their well-being. The Respondent has 
maintained an amicable relationship with the Grandparents residing next-door, 
allowing frequent access during his time with the children to visit and attend 
church, maintaining normalcy and peace. 
7. The choice to remain outside the home is a deliberate decision by the Petitioner 
during the transition period. Self-hosting and advertising is an essential 
requirement for my at-home operations, which is essential to maintain the quality 
of life our children are accustomed to. Multiple alternative housing options are 
available to the Petitioner, including the house next door. 
The Respondent remains committed to following the court's directives and ensuring the 
best possible outcomes for his children. He appreciates the court's attention to these 
matters and is ready to provide further information or clarification as needed. 
My name is Charles Dustin Myers my date of birth is 02-01-1991, and my address is 6641

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the additional child support payments for costs of health and 
dental insurance ordered below are payable through the state disbursement unit or as directed 
below and subject to the provisions for withholding from earnings provided above for other child

2. Definitions -
"Health Insurance" means insurance coverage that provides basic health-care services, 
including usual physician services, office visits, hospitalization, and laboratory, X-ray, and 
emergency services, that may be provided through a health maintenance organization or other 
private or public organization, other than medical assistance under chapter 32 of the Texas 
Human Resources Code. 
"Reasonable cost" means the total cost of health insurance coverage for all children for 
which MORGAN MYERS is responsible under a medical support order that does not exceed 9 
percent of MORGAN MYERS's annual resources, as described by section 154.062(b) of the 
Texas Family Code. 
"Health-care expenses" include, without limitation, medical, surgical, prescription drug, 
mental health-care services, dental, eye care, ophthalmological, and orthodontic charges but do 
not include expenses for travel to and from the provider or for nonprescription medication. 
"Health-care expenses that are not reimbursed by insurance" ("unreimbursed expenses") 
include related copayments and deductibles. 
3. Findings on Availability of Health Insurance -Having considered the cost, 
accessibility, and quality of health insurance coverage available to the parties, the Court finds: 
IT IS FURTHER FOUND that the following orders regarding health-care coverage are in 
the best interest of the children.

4. Provision of Health-Care Coverage-
As Petitioner's child support, MORGAN MYERS is ORDERED to obtain Medicaid for 
the children the subject of this suit, and then maintain health insurance for the children as long as 
child support is payable for that child. MORGAN MYERS is ORDERED -
a. to provide to each conservator of the children the following information no later 
than the thirtieth day after she received Medicaid for the children: 
a. MORGA MYERS' Social Security number;

c. The following information and documents: 
1. The name of the health insurance carrier; 
11. The number of the policy;

lapse of health insurance coverage of the children no later than the 
fifteenth day after the date of the termination or lapse; 
f. After termination or lapse of health insurance coverage, to notify 
each conservator of the children of the availability to MORGAN 
MYERS of additional health insurance for the children no later than 
the fifteenth day after the date the insurance becomes available; 
g. After termination or lapse of health insurance coverage, to enroll the 
children in a health insurance plan that is available to MORGAN 
MYERS at a reasonable cost at the next available enrollment period. 
Pursuant to section 1504.051 of the Texas Insurance Code, IT IS ORDERED that if 
MORGAN MYERS is eligible for dependent health coverage but fails to apply to obtain 
coverage for the children, the insurer shall enroll the children on application of CHARLES 
MYERS or others authorized by law. 
5. Allocation ofUnreimbursed Expenses -
The conservator who incurs a health-care expense on behalf of a child is ORDERED to 
provide to the other conservator receipts, bills, statements, or explanations of benefits showing 
the uninsured portion of the health-care expenses within thirty days after the incurring 
conservator receives them. The nonincurring conservator is ORDERED to pay the non-incurring 
conservator's percentage of the unreimbursed portion of the health-care expenses either by 
paying the health-care provider directly or by reimbursing the incurring conservator for any 
advance payment exceeding the incuning conservator's percentage of the unreimbursed portion 
of the health-care expenses within thirty days after the nonincurring conservator receives 
receipts, bills, statements, or explanations of benefits showing the unreimbursed portion of the

health-care expense. 
For the Court to hold the nonincurring conservator in civil or criminal contempt for 
failing to pay the nonincuning conservator's percentage of the unreimbursed portion of a health­
care expense, the incurring conservator must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the 
nonincurring conservator personally received receipts, bills, statements, or explanations of 
benefits reflecting the unreimbursed portion of the health-care expense no later than thirty days 
after the incuning conservator received them. Even if the incurring conservator fails to meet that 
burden of proof, the Court may award the incurring conservator a judgment in the nature of child 
support against the nonincuning conservator in the amount of the unreimbursed portion of the 
heath-care expense the nonincuning conservator was ordered but fail to pay. 
6. WARNING -A PARENT ORDERED TO PROVIDE HEALTII INSURANCE 
OR DENT AL INSURANCE OR TO PAY THE OTHER PARENT ADDITIONAL CHILD 
SUPPORT FOR THE COST OF HEALTII INSURANCE OR DENTAL INSURANCE WHO 
FAIT.,S TO DO SO IS LIABLE FOR NECESSARY MEDICAL EXPENSES OF THE 
CHILDREN, WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER THE EXPENSES WOULD HA VE BEEN 
PAID IF HEALTH INSURANCE OR DENTAL INSURANCE HAD BEEN PROVIDED, AND 
FOR THE COST OF HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS, DENTAL INSURANCE 
PRE:MIUMS, OR CONTRIBUTIONS, IF ANY, PAID ON BEHALF OF THE CHILDREN. 
7. Notice to Employer -On this date a Medical Support Notice was signed by the 
Court. For the purpose of section 1169 of title 29 of the United States Code, the conservator not 
carrying the health or dental insurance policy is designated the custodial parent and alternate 
recipient's representative.

I am of sound mind and capable of making this statement. I have personal knowledge of 
the facts written in this statement. I understand that if I lie in this statement, I may be held 
criminally responsible. This statement is true and correct. 
I, Aaron Watson, affirm my association with the data service managed 
by Mr. Charles Myers over the past two years. During this time, Mr. Myers has 
demonstrated a strong commitment to delivering high-quality service and has 
frequently shared personal stories that highlight his devotion to his daughters. 
His efforts to maintain a balance between his professional responsibilities and his 
commitment to familY,, such as surprising his daughters with lunch dates 
and celebrating significant family events, have endeared him to his customer 
base and fostered a close-knit community.

However, since December 2023, there has been a notable decline in the 
reliability and efficiency of the service provided. This shift coincides with Mr. 
Myers facing significant personal and legal challenges, including a divorce 
proceeding that has drastically impacted his ability to operate his business 
effectively. A particularly distressing development for Mr. Myers has been his 
inability to access the physical location where his business equipment and 
data connections are housed. This situation has not only disrupted the service 
but has also imposed significant financial difficulties on Mr. Myers, threatening 
the sustainability of the business and the quality of service that customers 
have come to expect. 
The repercussions of these challenges have been felt deeply by both Mr. 
Myers and his clientele. While the community understands and sympathizes 
with Mr. Myers' personal struggles, the increasing service disruptions have 
raised concerns among users about the future reliability and viability of the 
service. We are hopeful for a resolution that will allow Mr. Myers to regain 
access to his business infrastructure, thereby restoring the service quality and 
reliability that we have valued highly. It is in the interest of both Mr. Myers and 
his customers to find a solution that addresses these operational challenges 
while supporting him through his personal difficulties, ensuring the long-term 
success and sustainability of the service. •

I am of sound mind and capable of making this statement. I have personal knowledge of 
the facts written in this statement. I understand that if I lie in this statement, I may be held 
criminally responsible. This statement is true and correct. 
This statement serves as a formal declaration of my support for Mr. Charles Myers in light 
of recent challenges that have resulted in him being unjustly denied access to his home, where 
his business equipment and operations are based. As a paying client for two years prior to this 
incident, Mr. Myers maintained a flawless record of uninterrupted service, reflecting his 
hardworking nature and commitment to excellence. Mr. Myers's dedication to improving both his 
personal capabilities and the quality of his products has been the cornerstone of his reputation. 
The denial of Mr. Myers's access to his home has not only caused significant service 
disruptons but has also resulted in considerable financial losses for Mr. Myers, myself, and other 
paying clients that rely on the services that he offers. As someone directly affected by this 
situation, I have witnessed firsthand the stress and financial strain placed on Mr. Myers, compounded

I solemnly affirm that the statements herein are true to the best of my knowledge and belief,

financial and operational setbacks experienced. I submit this affidavit to express the urgent need 
for a resolution that addresses the losses incurred and to support the reinstatement of 
access to Mr. Myers's home for the restoration of business operations. It is my sincere hope that 
the court will recognize the undue hardship placed on Mr. Myers and facilitiate a swift resolution 
to restore his access to his home and thereby his ability to conduct business without further 
disruptions.

I am of sound mind and capable of making this statement. I have personal knowledge of 
the facts written in this statement. I understand that if I lie in this statement, I may be held 
criminally responsible. This statement is true and correct. 
I'm signing this affidavit to attest to the work ethic and 
dedication of Charles Myers. I've come to rely on the 
services he provides in order to gather the required data to 
make educated decisions on what and when to enter/exit 
options positions. Recently due to him not being at his 
normal location of operations the services have had multiple 
down times in which Charles was not in a position to be able 
to remedy. Some of these down times have led to significant 
losses due to making decisions without the necessary data 
after already being entered in a position.

Charles' work ethic is unlike anything I've seen in anyone 
I've ever met and he does everything for the future of his 
family. I'm constantly amazed at the feats he is able to pull 
off as a one man show. Some things he is able to create 
I didn't think were possible but he figures it out through 
his endless research and personal development efforts. 
Again, everything I've seen him do, he does to give his 
girls the best life he can and wants the world for them. 
I've seen videos of him with his children out at many 
different parks/recreational areas and I can tell that they 
love their father to death and that he would die for them. 
I hope his situation is resolved for not only my benefit but 
for the sakes of his children and the life he is trying to 
provide them with. Charles Myers is both a good person and 
amazing father and I would hate to see him and his daughters 
robbed of the life he is building that they need and deserve.

I am a paying customer of Charles Myers for the past two years and four months. In this time, he has been 
working exclusively out of his home office to run his business, and provide for his family. 
Charles has worked very hard for the past two years to provide a quality experience that benefits 
all of his customers. His ability to provide these services have been directly impacted by his inability to 
access his home office. As a result, my experience as a customer has suffered, and I am not receiving 
the level of service that I have been paying for. I understand that there are unfortunate circumstances 
and I am patient while Charles resolves his situation. He has been incredibly apologetic that he cannot 
provide the same level of quality, and uninterrupted service due to his inability to work out of his home 
office. I do not question his integrity with regards to this situation, he has always been honest and upfront 
with myself and others. My hope is that he may return to his home office in order to avoid shutting down

EXHIBIT L 
PROPOSED PARENTING PLAN 
01/07/23

IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
322ND DISTRICT FAMILY COURT 
MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS, § 
Plaintiff, § 
§ 
vs. § case No. 322-744538-23 
§ 
CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, § 
Defendant. § 
EXHIBIT A: TEMPORARY VISITATION ADJUSTMENT PROPOSAL 
Respondent: Charles Dustin Myers 
Understanding the intricate nature of our family's current situation and the legal complexities involved, I, 
Charles Dustin Myers, propose a thoughtful adjustment to the visitation schedule that aligns with our 
cohabiting status and the abrupt changes brought about by the divorce announcement 
1. Co-habitation Acknowledgement: 
It is acknowledged that both parents currently cohabit, which complicates traditional custody 
arrangements. Therefore, the immediate priority rs to facilitate a transition where both parties can 
establish their respective independent living and working arrangements without disrupting the children's 
lives. 
2. Transition Period: 
Morgan's Employment: Provide Morgan with the necessary support and time to secure stable 
employment, which is vital far her to contribute to the children's needs and establish her own residence. 
Stable Housing for Charles: As I seek stable housing to maintain my significant role in our daughters' 
lives, flexibility in visitation is essential to ensure I continue to fulfill my parental duties.

3. Work and Research Commitments: 
The concurrent legal proceedings, particularly those based on unverified claims, demand a substantial 
amount of my time for research and preparation to protect the children's well-being. 
My ability to work has been affected by the proceedings, necessitating an adjustment in my day-to-day 
routine to accommodate these new responsibilities. 
4. Interim Custody Logic: 
Continuity for Children: While we navigate these proceedings, It is critical to maintain stability and 
continuity for our children. Any temporary custody arrangements should reflect the least disruptive path 
for them. 
Counseling and Mediation: I strongly advocate for counseling or mediation to reconcile and navigate the 
divorce process, emphasizing the children's best interests rather than abrupt and contentious changes. 
5. Court's Facilitation: 
The court's facilitation in endorsing a temporary and flexible visitation framework Is crucial. This 
framework must account for the current living situation and the significant emotional and logistical 
upheaval that the divorce proceedings have caused. 
This proposal is made in the spirit of cooperation, with a focus on minimizing the impact of our marital 
dissolution on our children. It is with a sincere hope that we can transition into a stable co-parenting 
arrangement that keeps our children's welfare as the priority.

EXHIBIT M 
BACKGROUND REPORT FOR CASE 
CONSOLIDATION 01/03/24

322-7 44263-23 
Background Report for Case Consolidation 
Case Details: 
Divorce Case (Cause No. 322-744263-23) in the 322nd District Court ofTarrant County, filed on 
December 18, 2023. 
Protective Order Case (Cause No. 322-744538-23) in the 322nd District Court ofTarrant County. 
Reasons for Consolidation: 
Interconnected Issues: 
The divorce case and the protective order case involve overlapping issues concerning family violence 
allegations, which are central to the divorce proceedings and directly affect custody and visitation rights. 
The protective order case includes allegations of family violence, which are also a pivotal point in the 
divorce case in determining the waiver of the standard waiting period for the divorce. 
Consistency In Rulings: 
Consolidating the divorce and protective order cases would ensure consistency in the court's findings, 
particularly regarding any allegations of family violence and their impact on the dissolution of marriage, 
custody, and visitation rights. 
Judicial Economy: 
Hearing both cases together would promote judicial economy by avoiding duplication of legal 
proceedings, as both cases are likely to Involve similar witnesses, evidence, and legal arguments. 
Claims of False Statements: 
There have been claims of false statements and perjury related to the protective order, which could have 
significant implications for the divorce case. For instance, the claim that the plaintiff intentionally lied 
about being unable to pay court fees and made false allegations of family violence to gain an advantage 
in the divorce proceedings suggests that a single judge should hear both matters for a clear 
understanding of the facts.

Evidence of Misrepresentation and False Statements: 
Evidence provided suggests that there have been misrepresentations to the court, including the transfer 
of funds from the joint account and the plaintiff's interaction with third parties, which could affect both 
the protective order and the divorce outcome. The protective order-which was based on claims of 
family violence -are entirely baseless as I have no record of family violence, and no evidence from the 
Plaintiff has been provided to substantiate these claims. 
landlord-Tenant Relationship: 
The eviction case, although not directly related to family law matters, stems from claims and actions that 
are deeply intertwined with the divorce and protective order cases, suggesting that the alleged family 
violence and the actions of the plaintiff have been used to justify an eviction that coincides with the 
timing of the divorce and protective order filings. 
Conclusion: 
Given the overlapping factual and legal issues in the divorce and protective order cases, consolidation 
would serve the interests of justice and efficiency. It would ensure that the court has a comprehensive 
understanding of the intertwined nature of the family's circumstances, which is vital for fair and 
equitable resolution of these matters. While the eviction case may not be directly consolidated due to 
jurisdictional differences, it should be considered in context with the other cases to provide a complete 
picture of the ongoing disputes and to keep the best interests of our children intact.

RULE 12 MOTION TO SHOW 
AUTHORITY 09/20/24

322-7 44263-23 FILED 
TARRANT COUNTY 
9/20/2024 3:31 PM 
THOMAS A. WILDER 
DISTRICT CLERK 
NO. 322-744263-23 
IN THE 322ND DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
Morgan Michelle Myers, 
Petitioner, 
v. Respondent's Rule 12 Motion to Show 
Authority 
Charles Dustin Myers, 
Respondent 
2024-09-20 
To the Honorable Judge of the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County: 
REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION 
There is a general presumption that an attorney is acting with authority; 
however, that presumption is rebuttable. Breceda v. Whi, 187 S.W.3d 148, 152 
(Tex. App.--El Paso 2006, no pet.); Kelly v. Murphy, 630 S.W.2d 759, 761 
(Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1982, writ refd n.r.e.); see also City of San 
Antonio v. Aguilar, 670 S. W.2d 681, 684 (Tex. App.--San Antonio 1984, writ 
dism'd) ("[A]n attorney who has conducted a case in the trial court is 
presumed to have authority to pursue an appeal, although this presumption can 
be rebutted."). Here, however, this presumption is to be rebutted for the 
foregoing reasons: 
1

I. Legal Basis for Rule 12 Motion 
2. Pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. § 12, a party may challenge an attorney's 
authority to act on behalf of a party in a proceeding. When such a challenge is 
raised, the burden of proof shifts to the challenged attorney to demonstrate 
their authority to represent the party. Id. The attorney must appear before the 
trial court and show sufficient authority to prosecute or defend the suit on 
behalf of their client. (Breceda v. Whi (2006) 187 S.W.3d 148, 152; Kelly v. 
Murphy (1982) 630 S.W.2d 759, 761). 
3. Rule 12 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure permits any party to 
challenge an attorney's authority to prosecute or defend a lawsuit. (See Nolana 
Open MRI Ctr., Inc. v. Pechero (2015) No. 13-13-00552-CV, at *15). The 
purpose of a Rule 12 motion is to protect parties from groundless suits and to 
permit dismissal of suits instituted without authority. (See Nicholas v. Envtl. 
Sys. (Int'!) Ltd. (2016) 499 S.W.3d 888, 895; Angelina Cty. v. McFarland 
(1964) 374 S.W.2d 417, 422-23). 
4. Here, the procedural inconsistencies, lack of formal notice, and 
submission of documents by other parties on behalf of Ms. Carter raise 
substantial doubts about whether she possesses the necessary authority to 
represent the Petitioner. Despite being allegedly retained on January 22, 2024, 
Ms. Carter has not filed a formal notice of appearance, leaving her role 
ambiguous. Further complicating matters, filings under her name have been 
submitted by others, including the founder of Marx Altman & Johnson, her 
purported former employer. Coupled with her suspiciously timed State Bar 
profile update and lack of meaningful engagement, these facts compel the 
Respondent to seek clarification and challenge her authority under Rule 12. 
2

II. Procedural Basis 
5. No Formal Notice of Appearance Filed. Although Cooper Carter 
was allegedly retained on January 22, 2024, she has not filed a formal Notice 
of Appearance in this case. The absence of a Notice of Appearance creates 
substantial ambiguity regarding her authority to represent the Petitioner, 
especially given the procedural irregularities discussed below. 
6. Lack of engagement. Throughout the proceedings, Ms. Carter 
has consistently failed to engage in any meaningful way and has failed 
to respond to any pleadings in the suit. 
7. Filings Submitted on Behalf of Cooper Carter. All court 1 
documents and pleadings attributed to Ms. Carter have been submitted "on her 
behalf' by Roderick Marx, the founder of Marx Altman & Johnson. There 
is no indication that Ms. Carter is directly involved in this matter, raising 
significant questions about whether she is properly authorized to act as 
counsel for Morgan Michelle Myers. 
8. Discrepancies in employment. On Ms. Carter's public social 
media, she claims to be a former attorney for Marx Altman & Johnson and 
claims to be employed currently with Cantey Hanger LLP. 1 The timeliness of 
her profile aligns with the public article released by Cantey Hanger LLP 
1 ~rter's public Linked In profile 
3

themselves. 2 Further, Every attorney in Texas is required by law to maintain a 
current and up-to-date profile. Tex. Gov't Code § 81.115. Notably, Ms. 
Carter's profile was updated on March 13•\ 2024, one day prior to the only 
hearing that has occurred in this matter3 to her former employer. The 
Respondent has actively been seeking relief from the result of the 
aforementioned hearing for nearly seven months without any engagement or 
any authoritative activity from Ms. Carter, thus warranting this motion. 
III. Prayer and Relief 
9. Given the ongoing procedural irregularities and the apparent lack of 
clarity surrounding Cooper Carter's authority to represent Petitioner Morgan 
Myers, the Respondent respectfully requests the following: 
1. The Court should schedule a hearing requiring Cooper Carter to 
personally appear and definitively prove her authority to represent 
Morgan Myers, and to provide clarification as to who is involved in 
the case, and in what capacity Morgan Michelle Myers is being 
represented in this matter. 
11. "Upon [her] failure to show such authority, the court shall refuse 
to permit the attorney to appear in the cause, and shall strike the 
pleadings if no person who is authorized to prosecute or defend 
appears." (Tex. R. Civ. P. 12; see Kindle v. Wood Cnty. Elec. Co-op, Inc. 
(2004) 151 S. W.3d 206,210) 
2 News article corroborating employment timeline 
3 Ms. Carter's Texas State Bar profile. 
4

m. Grant of Summary Judgment Motion: Given that the 
Respondent's pending summary judgment motion filed on February 
26th, 2024, remains unchallenged due to the lack of any meaningful 
engagement from Cooper Carter, and in light of the procedural 
deficiencies highlighted above, the Court should grant the pending 
summary judgment via the attached order as unopposed for judicial 
efficiency and to reset the status quo ante. 
1v. Stay all other formal settings and proceedings until resolution of 
this motion. 
v. Respondent seeks no further sanctions against Ms. Carter 
given she fails to show her authority over the Petitioner in this 
matter.
