Both parties were present and appeared without legal representation. During the \nproceedings, Judge Munford presented the parties with an agreed continuance, which \nboth parties accepted, and which was subsequently granted by Judge Munford as \nreflected in his order. However, despite granting the continuance, Judge Munford went \nfurther, issuing a series of rulings where he sua sponte consolidated the protective order \ncase with the divorce case previously filed by the petitioner on December 18, 2023. \nExhibit B. He ordered the Respondent to vacate the residency that same day by 2:00 p.m., \ndivested him of the custody of his children, and the hearing was then rescheduled for \nJanuary 22, 2024, to be presided over by Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer. Exhibit C. \nD. This decision by Judge Munford undeniably raises serious questions regarding \nhis impartiality in this matter. Due process of law requires that an individual receive \nnotice and hearing before being deprived of a property right. In re the Guardianship of \nBays, 355 S.W.3d 715, 720 (Tex.

Exhibit B, p. 7. (\"The petitioner shall attach to the petition a copy of each \norder described by Subsection (a)(l) in which a party to the suit or the child of a party to \nthe suit was the applicant or victim of the conduct alleged in the application ... if a copy \nof the order is not available at the time of filing, the petition must state that a copy of the \norder will be filed with the court before any hearing.) All of the procedural safeguards \nabove were disregarded by James Munford. \nF. The purpose of temporary orders with injunctive relief is not to destroy the \nstatus quo, but rather to preserve it. See Iranian Muslim Organization v. City of San \nAntonio, 615 S.W.2d 202, 208 (Tex. 1981); Davis v. Huey, 571 S.W.2d 859, 862 (Tex. \n1978); Citizens of Texas Sav. v.

City of Lubbock, 498 \nS.W.3d 53 (Tex. 2016) improperly denied the City its undisputed right to access \ngroundwater-an essential resource-Judge Munford's rulings have deprived the \nRespondent of his residency, which has served not only as the family home since 2015 \nbut also as the headquarters for his business which provided for the children -an \nessential resource to their wellbeing. Furthermore, the Respondent was divested of \ncustodial rights to his children without justification.

The Respondent's burden of showing of bias or impartiality to such an extent \nthat the movant was deprived of a fair trial is satisfied from Judge Munford's initial \nruling. See Rodriguez v.

The \nRespondent asserts that a reasonable member of the public would indeed reasonably \ndoubt James Munford was actually impartial given that he deprived the Respondent of a \nfair trial. Thus, the Respondent's burden and threshold for recusal has been met, and \nJudge James Munford should be recused from this matter. \nI.

The Respondent retained \nthe services of Dan Bacalis, while the Petitioner arrived without any legal representation \nand retained the services of Cooper Carter in the lobby of the courtroom.

Exhibit \nD. Neither party appeared before the Jeffrey Kaitcer, and this decision was made without \nany input from the Respondent and without any opportunity to contest it. \nB.

The agreement removed the children from their own home that they had resided \nin their entire life and allowed the Respondent back into the home until March 1, 2024. It \nalso established child support, and allocated financial responsibilities to the parties, to \nwhere the Respondent was left with both car payments, an unreasonable amount of time \nto transition from the home and with the addition of child support obligations.

Since this day, the Respondent has \npursued relief to no avail, without argument, and without any response or findings of \nfacts from either judge or Cooper Carter, petitioner's counsel. \nG. On March 14, 2024, the parties appeared before Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer \nto address the Respondent's motion to reconsider. Just minutes prior to the hearing, the \nRespondent was served formally reduced temporary orders by Cooper L. Carter, which \ncontained significant clerical discrepancies and deviated from the original orders signed \non February 1, 2024. These orders are currently in effect today as 'agreed orders'. Exhibit \nI. The orders also reference a hearing that was never conducted in this case. \nH. During the hearing, the Respondent was precluded from addressing the events \nleading up to February 1, 2024, due to sustained objections based on relevance. Despite \nsigning off on the Associate Judge's Report which non-suited the protective order, the \nopposing counsel was nonetheless permitted to elicit testimony from their client \nregarding her purported fear for safety should Respondent be allowed near the residency, \nwhich has not been supported by any evidence to date. \nI. Judge Kaitcer refused to admit the Respondent's exhibits, which included \naffidavits from business clients prepared to attest to his need for residency and his close \nrelationship with his daughters.

The Respondent's motion for reconsideration concluded with an illegible order, \nrequiring him to sign the temporary orders served just moments earlier by 1 :30 p.m. that \nsame day. Exhibit K.

What began with \nMorgan Michelle Myers attempting to avoid responsibility has now evolved into a \ntroubling scenario where both judges have repeatedly failed to recognize and correct their \nserious missteps. Attorney Cooper Carter's authority to represent the petitioner, currently \nbeing challenged through a Rule 12 motion, further deepens concerns about the integrity \nand fairness of these proceedings. \nRecusing both judges is not just a procedural necessity, but a crucial step toward \nensuring that this case is reviewed impartially and that the facts are properly considered. \nThis will allow the court to focus on the petitioner's pattern of deception and, more \nimportantly, what truly serves the best interests of the children. The petitioner's actions \nhave caused unnecessary delays, destabilized her family, and inflicted significant \nemotional and financial harm on all involved. The ongoing litigation, exacerbated by a \nlack of judicial transparency and accountability, has only added to the hardship. \nDespite these issues, the Respondent holds no ill will toward any party involved. \nHis primary concern has always been, and continues to be, doing what is right for his \nchildren. The Respondent believes that with impartial judges and a renewed focus on \nfairness, this case can still be resolved justly, allowing all parties to move forward with \ndignity and integrity. The Respondent remains diligent in his commitment to securing a \nfair outcome that reflects the best interests of his children as the Family Code mandates. \n14",

The decisions rendered by both \nJudge Munford and Judge Kaitcer have caused significant harm to my ability to \nmaintain stability for my children and have compounded my financial hardship. \n18",

This protective order was denied by the courts. \n2. Due to the fact this order was not granted by the court, one could conclude that \nthere was not a clear and present danger of family violence.1 \nB. THE DIVORCE PETITION \n1. Petition was filed on 2024-12-18 under an Affidavit of Inability to pay.2 \n2. The Petitioner's action of filing for divorce under an Affidavit of Inability to pay \nthree days after transferring $1,576 to herself starkly contravenes the mandates \nset forth in Chapter 10, Section 10.001 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code.

The suit was unlawful by natures, as the grounds for eviction were based on \nfamily status, referencing the divorce as well as a protective order that had been \ndenied on December 14th, 2023. The suit was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction on \nJanuary 17th, 2024. 6 \nD. PROTECTIVE ORDER \n1. This suit was the second attempt by the Petitioner to have me removed from \nthe home, which ultimately succeeded. \n2. The claims within this suit mentioned sexually aggressive comments and \nthreatening behavior. These allegations are materially false, as the Petitioner \npossesses no evidence, and has presented no evidence in relation to these claims \nsince the initiation of the suit. Despite this, as video and image evidence will show \nonce a fair trial date is set, the Petitioner and I continued to maintain stability at \nour family home and preserved the sense of normalcy that our daughters have \nbeen accustomed to their entire lives up until January 16th, 2024. \nThe Court's decision to remove me from my home and my children's lives on January \n16th, 2024, albeit preliminary and unjustified, bypassed the safeguarding of the children's \nemotional, psychological, and physical well-being. This oversight is compounded by the \nPetitioner's actions. The juxtaposition of the Court's decision against the backdrop of the \nPetitioner's inattention to the children's needs illuminates a disconcerting disregard for the \nparamount principle that custody determinations should primarily serve the children's best \ninterests. The final section of this motion will highlight the procedural aspects of the events \nunfolding between the dates of January 16th, 2024, and February l5t, 2024, and pray the court \nwill rectify this situation by restoring the stability to our family by vacating the current \ntemporary orders that are in place until a proper investigation can be completed by the courts. \n5 TEXAS RULES OF CML PROCEDURE -RULE 6 -Suits initiated on a Sunday are invalid. \n6 See attached EXHIBIT B.2 - A true and accurate copy of the Eviction Dismissal. \n-5-\n\u00b7\u00b7\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u00b7\u00b7 \u2022\u2022-\u2022o~,:A~>'\u2022 A CERTIFIED COPY \nt'_,4.-\u2022\u2022 <6\\ ATTEST: 04/15/2024 \n[8 . ~ %\\ THOMAS A.

      "text": "THE PROTECTIVE ORDER HEARINGS \n1. In preparation for the Protective Order hearing on January 161h, 2024, I filed with the \nCourt an answer to the Protective Order on January 2nd, 2024 as well as two motions - a \nmotion to consolidate the divorce with the protective order, filed on January 41h, 2024, as \nwell as a motion of continuance, filed on January 81h, 2024 for the purpose to acquire \ncounsel due to the complex nature of the case.1 All three filings were accepted by the \ncourt. \n2. On January 16th, 2024, both parties sought additional time to secure legal \nrepresentation. Despite not reviewing any evidence, witness testimonies, or documents \nrelated to the motions, and acknowledging the denial of a previous Emergency Protective \nOrder, the court mandated my departure from our home within four hours. This \ndecision, unexpectedly made, awarded custody to the Petitioner, overlooking my \nconcerns about the adverse effects on our children and my work from home. This ruling, \nwhich both parties did not sign, set the case to resume on January 22nd, 2024, to allow \ntime for obtaining counsel. 2 \n3. Following the court's directive, I relocated to my father's residence in Flower Mound until \nthe subsequent hearing. During this interval, the Petitioner did not take the initiative to \nhave the children call once and did not provide any information as to how they were \ndoing, showcasing her lack of empathy and concern for our children's well-being and \nstability. After incurring substantial expenses to secure representation, I detailed my case \nand concerns to my attorney, preparing for the next court appearance. \n4. On January 22nd, 2024, the Petitioner chose to seek legal representation just minutes \nbefore the hearing was due to start, indicating a disregard for the process. My lawyer \nrecommended agreeing to a continuance, thereby extending the period I couldn't work \nand impacting our established family dynamics. This resulted in a third hearing being set \nfor February 1st, coinciding with my birthday, and a second rendition being ordered. 3 \n1 See attached EXHIBIT C.1 -A true and accurate copies of all referenced filings in paragraph 1. \n2 See attached EXHIBIT C.2 - A true and accurate copy of the unsigned rendition ordered on January 161\\ 2024. \n3 See attached EXHIBIT C.3 -A true and accurate copy of the second rendition ordered on January 22nd, 2024. \n-6-\n\u2022\u2022m\u2022~;T;:;~;_-..

      "text": "5. On February 1st, 2024, during the third hearing, the substantive issues I had raised were \nnot addressed, nor was there any exchange of evidence between our legal representatives. \nDespite the focus of the hearing supposed to be on the protective order, the discussions \nveered into custody and child support matters. My lawyer presented the sole option of a \ntemporary return to the family home for 30 days with expanded visitation rights, coupled \nwith a child support obligation starting in April. This outcome, which diverged significantly \nfrom the case's core issues, compelled me to reconsider my legal representation. \nConsequently, I decided to terminate my attorney's services and embarked on drafting this \nmotion myself, aiming to bring the court's attention back to the pivotal elements of the case \nthat had thus far been neglected while able to legally reside in my home. \nCONCLUSION AND PRAYER \nIn conclusion, this motion has laid bare the stark realities and procedural aberrations that have \nmarred the essence of justice and due process in the matter of Cause No. 322-744263-23. \nThrough the course of these proceedings, it has become abundantly clear that the actions taken \nby the Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, have not only disregarded the welfare and best \ninterests of our children but have also illuminated her unfitness as a parent. Her actions speak \nto a pattern of deceit, manipulation, and an unsettling willingness to leverage the judicial \nsystem for personal vendettas, all at the expense of the emotional and psychological well-being \nof our children. \nThe court, in its decisions, inadvertently facilitated this troubling trajectory by removing me, \nCharles Dustin Myers, from the lives of our children based on unsubstantiated claims and \nwithout due consideration of my role as a devoted and stable parent. This oversight has not \nonly disrupted the lives of our children but has also significantly impaired my ability to provide \nfor them, casting a long shadow over their future stability and welfare. \nMoreover, the conduct of my Counsel involved has further compounded these issues, \ndemonstrating a distressing disregard for the intricate dynamics and facts of this case. This has \nculminated in a situation where the paramount importance of the children's best interests and \nthe fundamental principles of fairness and justice have been overshadowed by procedural \nmissteps and a lack of thorough investigation into the Petitioner's fitness as a parent. \n-7-\n\u00b7\u00b7m\u00b7~;~:.:R~;-..

Vacate the existing temporary orders that unjustly removed me from my home and \nseparated me from my children, restoring the status quo ante until a thorough and \nunbiased evaluation of the facts can be conducted, as the Texas Constitution requires. If \nleft as it stands, these orders will further compound the issues at hand, and will \nexacerbate the chaos introduced into the children's lives. \n2. Set a fair hearing date to delve into the substantive issues at hand, ensuring that all \nparties are given an equitable opportunity to present their case and that the best \ninterests of our children are placed at the forefront of all considerations. \n3. Scrutinize any response or new claims from the Petitioner or her counsel with the utmost \ndiligence, given the established pattern of deceitful and manipulative behavior exhibited \nby the Petitioner throughout these proceedings. \n4. Consider awarding me full custody of our children, ensuring their continued access to a \nstable, nurturing environment, and the consistent provision of their needs, which I am \nfully committed to upholding. Furthermore, in alignment with my enduring belief in the \nimportance of both parents in the lives of our children, I pledge to facilitate and \nencourage a healthy, constructive relationship between the children and their mother, \nprovided she demonstrates a genuine commitment to their well-being and stability. \n5.

WILDER \nDISTRICT CLERK \nMorgan Michelle Myers, Cause No. 322-744263-23 \nPetitioner, \nV. \nNOTICE AND UNSWORN DECLARATION \nCharles Dustin Myers, \nRespondent \nMarch 3, 2024 \nDear Clerk of the Court, \nThis letter is submitted on behalf of the Respondent in the above-referenced case to \nprovide the court with an update on the Respondent's efforts to uphold the well-being of \nthe children under the current agreed arrangements pending review and to navigate the \ncomplexities of this case. The following reasons why it is impossible for the Respondent \nto vacate the family home under the current agreement pending review are as follows: \n1. Since the inception of the case, the Respondent's primary focus has been to reset \nthe status quo ante for the benefit of the children, ensuring their lives remain as \nnormal and uninterrupted as possible during this transitory period after it was \nsignificantly disrupted beginning on January 16th, 2024. Despite the challenges \nposed by the non-suited protective order and the dropped allegations of family \nviolence which were the foundations of all decisions made within this case, the \nRespondent has respected the orders pending review, and has strived to provide a \nstable and supportive environment for his children during his designated time, all \nwhile planning a transition that best suits his children. \n2. During the short amount of time the Respondent has been re-instated to his home, \nthe Petitioner has, on multiple occasions, entered the residence unannounced and \nwithout prior consent, actions which stand in stark contrast to her prior requests \nfor protection which have governed this case. \n,\u2022\u2022-\u2022o;;~;~'.;;\u2022...

Petitioner has relinquished custody of the children to the Respondent on multiple \ndays during her scheduled time, showcasing the Respondent's ability to care for \nhis children at any time given his at-home work schedule specifically crafted to \nensure participation in every aspect of his children's lives remains possible. \n5. The Respondent must dedicate substantial time to researching and understanding \nlegal procedures to ensure compliance with court rules and to advocate effectively \nfor the best interests of his children. He is prepared to present all relevant facts \nand evidence at the upcoming hearing on March 14th, should his partial summary \njudgment not be accepted. \n6. The Respondent has made efforts over the past 30 days to maintain normalcy for \nhis children, showcasing his dedication to their well-being. The Respondent has \nmaintained an amicable relationship with the Grandparents residing next-door, \nallowing frequent access during his time with the children to visit and attend \nchurch, maintaining normalcy and peace. \n7. The choice to remain outside the home is a deliberate decision by the Petitioner \nduring the transition period. Self-hosting and advertising is an essential \nrequirement for my at-home operations, which is essential to maintain the quality \nof life our children are accustomed to. Multiple alternative housing options are \navailable to the Petitioner, including the house next door. \nThe Respondent remains committed to following the court's directives and ensuring the \nbest possible outcomes for his children.

      "text": "However, since December 2023, there has been a notable decline in the \nreliability and efficiency of the service provided. This shift coincides with Mr. \nMyers facing significant personal and legal challenges, including a divorce \nproceeding that has drastically impacted his ability to operate his business \neffectively. A particularly distressing development for Mr. Myers has been his \ninability to access the physical location where his business equipment and \ndata connections are housed. This situation has not only disrupted the service \nbut has also imposed significant financial difficulties on Mr. Myers, threatening \nthe sustainability of the business and the quality of service that customers \nhave come to expect. \nThe repercussions of these challenges have been felt deeply by both Mr. \nMyers and his clientele. While the community understands and sympathizes \nwith Mr. Myers' personal struggles, the increasing service disruptions have \nraised concerns among users about the future reliability and viability of the \nservice. We are hopeful for a resolution that will allow Mr. Myers to regain \naccess to his business infrastructure, thereby restoring the service quality and \nreliability that we have valued highly. It is in the interest of both Mr. Myers and \nhis customers to find a solution that addresses these operational challenges \nwhile supporting him through his personal difficulties, ensuring the long-term \nsuccess and sustainability of the service. \u2022 \nSigned this ___..l-=-1 __ day of f\\A.t>,.~c.. \"\" zo z.

Co-habitation Acknowledgement: \nIt is acknowledged that both parents currently cohabit, which complicates traditional custody \narrangements. Therefore, the immediate priority rs to facilitate a transition where both parties can \nestablish their respective independent living and working arrangements without disrupting the children's \nlives. \n2. Transition Period: \nMorgan's Employment: Provide Morgan with the necessary support and time to secure stable \nemployment, which is vital far her to contribute to the children's needs and establish her own residence. \nStable Housing for Charles: As I seek stable housing to maintain my significant role in our daughters' \nlives, flexibility in visitation is essential to ensure I continue to fulfill my parental duties. \n,\u2022\u2022~;;,;'.~;_-..

Work and Research Commitments: \nThe concurrent legal proceedings, particularly those based on unverified claims, demand a substantial \namount of my time for research and preparation to protect the children's well-being. \nMy ability to work has been affected by the proceedings, necessitating an adjustment in my day-to-day \nroutine to accommodate these new responsibilities. \n4. Interim Custody Logic: \nContinuity for Children: While we navigate these proceedings, It is critical to maintain stability and \ncontinuity for our children. Any temporary custody arrangements should reflect the least disruptive path \nfor them. \nCounseling and Mediation: I strongly advocate for counseling or mediation to reconcile and navigate the \ndivorce process, emphasizing the children's best interests rather than abrupt and contentious changes. \n5. Court's Facilitation: \nThe court's facilitation in endorsing a temporary and flexible visitation framework Is crucial. This \nframework must account for the current living situation and the significant emotional and logistical \nupheaval that the divorce proceedings have caused. \nThis proposal is made in the spirit of cooperation, with a focus on minimizing the impact of our marital \ndissolution on our children. It is with a sincere hope that we can transition into a stable co-parenting \narrangement that keeps our children's welfare as the priority. \nRespectfully submitted, \nx~~ a\\-o~-J.~~ \nCharles D ~yers \n6641 Anne Court \nWatauga, Texas 76148 \n817-507-6562 \nChuckdustin12@gmail.com \n.\u2022\u2022~;;:.:;;;;;~..

For instance, the claim that the plaintiff intentionally lied \nabout being unable to pay court fees and made false allegations of family violence to gain an advantage \nin the divorce proceedings suggests that a single judge should hear both matters for a clear \nunderstanding of the facts.",

The protective order-which was based on claims of \nfamily violence -are entirely baseless as I have no record of family violence, and no evidence from the \nPlaintiff has been provided to substantiate these claims. \nlandlord-Tenant Relationship: \nThe eviction case, although not directly related to family law matters, stems from claims and actions that \nare deeply intertwined with the divorce and protective order cases, suggesting that the alleged family \nviolence and the actions of the plaintiff have been used to justify an eviction that coincides with the \ntiming of the divorce and protective order filings. \nConclusion: \nGiven the overlapping factual and legal issues in the divorce and protective order cases, consolidation \nwould serve the interests of justice and efficiency. It would ensure that the court has a comprehensive \nunderstanding of the intertwined nature of the family's circumstances, which is vital for fair and \nequitable resolution of these matters.

When such a challenge is \nraised, the burden of proof shifts to the challenged attorney to demonstrate \ntheir authority to represent the party. Id. The attorney must appear before the \ntrial court and show sufficient authority to prosecute or defend the suit on \nbehalf of their client. (Breceda v. Whi (2006) 187 S.W.3d 148, 152; Kelly v. \nMurphy (1982) 630 S.W.2d 759, 761). \n3. Rule 12 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure permits any party to \nchallenge an attorney's authority to prosecute or defend a lawsuit. (See Nolana \nOpen MRI Ctr., Inc. v. Pechero (2015) No. 13-13-00552-CV, at *15). The \npurpose of a Rule 12 motion is to protect parties from groundless suits and to \npermit dismissal of suits instituted without authority. (See Nicholas v. Envtl. \nSys. (Int'!) Ltd. (2016) 499 S.W.3d 888, 895; Angelina Cty. v. McFarland \n(1964) 374 S.W.2d 417, 422-23). \n4. Here, the procedural inconsistencies, lack of formal notice, and \nsubmission of documents by other parties on behalf of Ms. Carter raise \nsubstantial doubts about whether she possesses the necessary authority to \nrepresent the Petitioner. Despite being allegedly retained on January 22, 2024, \nMs. Carter has not filed a formal notice of appearance, leaving her role \nambiguous. Further complicating matters, filings under her name have been \nsubmitted by others, including the founder of Marx Altman & Johnson, her \npurported former employer. Coupled with her suspiciously timed State Bar \nprofile update and lack of meaningful engagement, these facts compel the \nRespondent to seek clarification and challenge her authority under Rule 12. \n2",
