9 ISSUE S PRESENTED  
1.Given evidence suggesting that the Petitioner fabricated allegations of
family violence to secure a tactical advantage in custody and divorce
proceedings, does this raise a significant legal question regarding the
adequacy of safeguards against misuse of p rotective orders, potentially
warranting a review of the court ’s reliance on unverified claims in making
preliminary decisions affecting parental rights and access to children?
2.Considering the absence of concrete evidence indicating an immediate
risk of harm or abuse towards the Petitioner or minor children, did the
Court’s initial decision to issue Temporary Orders on January 16th, 
followed by January 22nd, and February 1st—thereby excluding the 
Respondent from the family residence and severing his relationship with 
his children —constitute an abuse of discretion lacking clear evidence of 
danger for such emergency action, ultimately leading to a violation of the 
Respondent ’s due process and infringement of constitutional and parental 
rights, while also disregarding the children ’s best interest s? 
3.How can the Court remove one parent from the home without following
the mandated process required by law, resulting in the destruction of the
status quo of the minor children, and further uphold this decision  when
no finding of facts has taken place ?

11 EMPLOYMENT HISTORY  AND FAMILY DYNAMICS  
1.Throughout their marriage, both parents have alternated roles as stay -at-
home parents, adapting their employment status to meet the 
developmental needs and schedules of their children, now aged seven and 
five. This arrangement has enabled both the Petition er and Respondent to 
maintain an active and consistent presence in their children’s lives, 
encompassing not only day -to-day care but also engagement in school 
activities and extracurricular events. This hands -on approach has been a 
testament to their dedic ation to the well -being and upbringing of their 
children, demonstrating a flexible yet committed stance towards 
balancing family responsibilities with personal and professional 
development opportunities as they arise.  
2.The Couple had lived paycheck to paycheck for most of the marriage, and
things began to look up when the Petitioner acquired a job as a Leasing 
Agent/Consultant near our home. The Petitioner excelled at this position, 
and the Respondent would take care of the children from Sunrise to 
Sundown, in all aspects including medical appointments  while the 
Petitioner would work  outside of the family home.  
3.The unique situation the Couple had been blessed with put them in a
situation where the children could frequently visit their grandparents next 
door, creating a rare and ideal situation for them, also enabling the 
Respondent to help generate income by acquiring a part -time Legal

12 Transcriptionist job from home while the children were in the care of the 
Grandparents.  
4.During May of 2019, the Petitioner was unexpectedly terminated from
her job  as a Leasing Agent , where the Couple once more swapped roles as 
the stay -at-home parent, and the Respondent quickly acquired 
employment at Classic Mazda of Denton, starting on July 1st, 2019. 
5.This transition was very difficult, as the Respondent went from seeing his
children every day to sometimes not at all given the hour -long commute 
to work and extraneous hours and was in an entirely  new field of work  as 
a sales associate.  
6.In the Fall of 2019, the COVID -19 pandemic hit and put the dealership in
a state of uncertainty by significantly reducing the number of patrons 
who would visit the dealership, which impacted the monthly commission 
for the Respondent , creating significant down -time that the Respondent 
took advantage of by self-certifying himself in many areas of the 
dealership.  
7.One evening at  work, the Respondent noticed the Photographer taking
photos of the vehicles  out on the lot  for the purpose of displaying them on 
the dealership’s website,  which sparked an idea that would ultimately

 become the sales solution for the dealership during the COVID -19 
pandemic.  
 
8. In November of 2019, t he Respondent created a YouTube channel 
entitled Charlie and the Mazdas, where he began to use his self -
certification for internet sales to create personalized videos for internet 
clients  during the pandemic, allowing them to see the features of their 
desired vehicle from the comfort of their own home. If the client  decided 
to move forward, t he Respondent would wrap the steering wheels in 
plastic wrap, wash the vehicles himself, and drive them to the client’s 
residence as a courtesy service during the pandemic.  
 
 
 
9. This approach  was not only successful but  lead to the Respondent 
finishing second overall for the Southwest Region of the United States for 
Mazda sales  for the year of 2020.  
 
 
10. The Couple also leased their first vehicle in November of 2019, which was 
a Mazda CX -5 Grand Touring model , machine grey.  
 
 
11. As the year 2020 unfolded, the Respondent found himself increasingly 
drawn to the stock market. This interest was sparked by the extraordinary 
market conditions of 2020, fueled by the Federal Reserve’s pivotal 
amendments to Regulation D and the Supplementa l Leverage Ratio. 
These changes were instrumental in maintaining bank liquidity, enabling 
continued lending to high -risk companies amid the pandemic, presenting 
unique investment opportunities.

12. By January 2021, inspired by his burgeoning passion for financial 
markets —and motivated by a desire to reclaim precious time with the 
Children —the Respondent made a conscientious decision to part ways 
with the dealership. This step was taken in good faith, driven by his 
commitment to both his family and his growing interest in financial 
markets, setting the stage for a new chapter in his profess ional and 
personal life since his employment began on July 1st, 2019.  
 
 
13. Shortly after starting this new chapter, the Respondent quickly realized 
trading was going to be a lot more challenging than he had first realized, 
which lead to the evolution of his YouTube channel, renamed from 
Charlie and the Mazdas to Charlie’s Vids , where he turned his focus to 
SEC law, covering agency filings out of the Options Clearing Corporation, 
National Securities Clearing Corporation, Depository Trust Company, 
Depository Trust Clearing Corporation, FINRA, the Code of Federal 
Regulations, the Off ice of Financial Research, amongst other market 
agencies.  
 
 
14. The Respondent would cover the filings, accompanied by PowerPoint 
presentations for the viewer, which quickly became well -received, 
garnering the Respondent over 30,000 subscribers by May of 2021.

 15. The surge in viewership not only augmented the family’s income but also 
established a robust passive income stream for the Respondent and his 
family. This financial uplift empowered him to delve further into the 
intricacies of the financial sector, focusin g on market architecture, the 
mechanics of trading, and the analysis of market data.  
 
 
16. By September 12th, 2021, his deepened interest in financial market data 
culminated in the launch of a unique  service. This innovative venture 
offered market data solutions to clients through a variety of platforms 
including Discord and Telegram, alongside tailored scanners, feeds, and 
bots. Leveraging Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), 
sophisticated pyth onic programming, and advanced database 
engineering, the Respondent  crafted customizable data streams to meet 
the specific needs of his clientele , all self -taught by the Respondent . 
 
 
17. The escalating demands of the Respondent’s business necessitated an 
upgrade to more potent computing hardware in February 2022. This 
strategic investment enabled him to further scale his operations, 
propelling the family towards financial independence.  
 
 
18. Parallel to the Respondent’s business ascent, the Petitioner took on a 
more prominent role within their children ’s educational community. Her 
involvement with the school’s Parent Teacher Association (PTA) 
eventually led her to the presidency, making  a significant contribution to 
their children’s educational environment.

19. The culmination of these endeavors was celebrated with the family’s first 
vacation in July 2022.5 They chose South Padre Island, Texas —a place of 
sentimental value, as it was where the Respondent spent many cherished 
moments of his childhood. Staying in the home that hosted his formative 
years, they created new memories as a family, intertwining past and 
present.  
 
 
20. Throughout the remainder of the year and into 2023, the couple 
continued in their respective roles, gradually drifting apart. The 
Respondent, deeply engrossed in his business, and the Petitioner, 
yearning for new experiences outside the home, unknowingly a llowed a 
gap to form between them, threatening the unity of their marriage. 
Despite this, their commitment to their children ’s welfare remained 
unwavering, a testament to their dedication, as seen in the children ’s 
thriving well -being and exceptional achievements in school and dance.  
 
 
21. In July of 2023, the family took another trip to South Padre Island, a 
journey that served both to revisit cherished memories and create new 
ones.

17 22. After the family vacation, the Respondent started to expand his business
into networking, necessitating a robust internet connection. He needed to 
secure various services linked to his local IP address and handle a large 
amount of data, making cloud storage or hosting impr actical for his needs 
due to the costs associated with it.  
23. Around this same time, the Petitioner acquired a part -time job in the City
of Watauga, where she would work primarily evenings and on Saturdays, 
frequently visiting the residence of her fr iends after work.

25 III. Undisputed Evidentiary Facts
1.The Petitioner , Morg an Michell e Myers,  knowingly  and willingly
deceived  the Court under penalty of Perjury in the following  
manner  since the onset of the case : 
i.The Petitioner knowingly and willingly filed for divorce
claiming an  Affidavit of Inability to P ay just four days after 
emptying the  Couple ’s joint bank account  into Dan 
Branthoover ’s Pay Pal account, where it was subsequently 
transferred to the Petitioner ’s sole bank account , as 
admitted by Mr. Branthoover himself on December 16th, 
2023. 
ii.The Petitioner knowingly and willingly filed for an
Emergency EX -Parte Order of Protection  on December 14th, 
2023, yet was compelled to invite the Respondent to the 
school field -trip, directly contradicting the need for 
protection from the Respondent.  
iii.The Petitioner was under the influence of Dan Branthoover ,
who stated his intent to help the Petitioner file the divorce 
paperwork  on December 16th, 2023 , and after the divorce 
was filed,  referred to himself as her attorney  while having 
no license to practice la w in Texas or any other state.

26 iv.The Petitioner knowingly and willingly waived the 60 -day
waiting period for divorce , citing that an active order of 
protection was currently in place, and that family violence 
had been found  to have occurred  during the Couple ’s 
marriage.  Neither of these statements were true, as the 
Petitioner was denied such an order just four days prior . 
v.The Petitioner knowingly and willingly influenced the
Couple’s landlords into believing that she needed  
protection , which was followed by the initiation o f an 
Eviction suit on Sunday, 12-17-2023 in which the 
Respo ndent prevailed on 01-17-2024  due to lack of 
jurisdiction.  
vi.The Petitioner  filed for a Protective Order on 12 -22-2023,
while subsequently  cohabit ing with the Respondent and the 
Children  that same evening  clearly in n o need of protection.  
vii.The deliberate actions of the Petitioner and her family
members reflect a concerted effort that is both vindictive 
and predatory in nature, indicating a clear conspiracy to 
engage in unlawful conduct11 aimed at depriving the 
Respondent of his parental rights, his ability to  provide , and 
most impor tantly:  damaging  the children ’s well -being . 
11 The Texas Family Law Practice Manual points out a Civil Conspiracy as a valid cause of action for 
divorce proceedings . See § 8.56 , Ch.8

27 2.The Court has, perhaps unintentionally, endorsed the behavior
detailed in paragraph 1 by failing to thoroughly examine the case ’s 
facts, despite their repeated emphasis throughout these 
proceedings.  
3.The opposing Counsel has not conducted any meaning ful discovery
in this case to warrant any significant decisions  which has 
ultimately damaged the future outlook of the children by awarding 
full custody to the Petitioner  for no valid reason.  The only 
discovery conducted in this case amounts to financial disclosures 
which have since significantly changed,  as the Petitioner h as 
changed empl oyment , and the Respondent has been unable to 
work to full capacity since Ma rch 6th, 2024.  
4.The Petitioner ’s lack of full -time employment raises significant
concerns regarding their ability to meet the financial needs of the 
minor children involved in this case. This issue casts doubt on the 
Court ’s decision to grant the Petitioner full custody and exclusive 
access to the family home. The decision, which appears to have 
been made on subjective grounds, preemptively removed the 
Respondent from the home before they had the opportunity to 
secure legal representation. Such an action not only adversely 
affects the welfare of the children but also constitutes a clear 
misapplication of judicial discretion.  
5.The Court  and Opposing counsel exhibit a strong conflict of
interest, as the opposing Counsel had no initial interest in the

 Divorce case, which is reflective in her failure to appropriately 
conduct discovery or d etermine  what is truly in the best interests 
of the children.  
 
6. The Respon dent would care for the children while the Petitioner 
worked her evening shifts multiple times per week.  
 
 
7. The Respondent would care for the children in all aspects of their 
lives leading up to his removal on January 16th, 202 4, including 
while the Petitioner was out of the home filing for protection 
against him . 12 
 
 
8. Both the Respondent and opposing Counsel have intentionally 
delayed proceedings and failed to provide any evidence, witness 
lists, documents, or any other tangible items as required by both 
the Local Court Rules and the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.

29 RESPONDENT ’S PARENTAL INDEX  
The Respondent has had one objective throughout this case: 
_________ _________________________________________  
To prioritize the children ’s well -being and uphold the existing familial structure, 
while actively promoting a healthy and ongoing relationship between the children 
and both parents. This commitment is rooted in the understanding that the 
continued involvement of both parents in the  children ’s daily lives is not only 
beneficial but essential for their emotional and psychological development. The 
Respondent seeks to ensure that the children ’s interests are placed at the forefront of 
all decisions, advocating for a stable and nurturing environment that supports their 
growth and well-being , which is not the current environment .

While the Petitioner spent the majority of her time between  the dates of 
2023 -12-01 and 2024 -01-16 filing frivolous suits  rather than considering 
the children ’s best interests, the Respondent prioritized their holiday  and 
school break while simultaneously combating concurrent lawsuits brought 
against him by the Petitioner and her family .

33 THE RESPONDEN T’S EFFORTS  
1.Due to having failed legal representation, the resources required to
acquire alternative Counsel after the termination of Mr. Bacalis  coupled
with the growing dis -trust of the Judicial System as a whole given the
totality of circumstances left the Respondent with having to represent
himself , which is a ta sk he has taken seriously in an effort to advocate for
his daughters in a zealous manner.
2.The Respondent has researched and is aware  of the ever-growing burden
pro-se litigants ar e becoming on the Court s, their staff , and their
resources  due to the vast majority of pro-se litigants not putting in the
time or effort reasonably required to represent themselves effectively or
are solely trying to reduce costs associated with their case, both leading to
increased case lengths and litigation costs .
3.The Respondent in this case stands out from the stereotype as follow s:
a.Since the removal of  his home on January 16th, 202 4, the Respondent
has self -developed software to assist himself in the process  of self -
representation. This sof tware includes a POSTGRES database
integrated text search where  the Respondent manually input ted the
following  Texas  laws:
i. The Texas Family Code
ii. The Texas Rules of Evidence
iii. The Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional
Conduct  
iv. The Texas Code  of Judicial Conduct
v. The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure

b.The Respondent has remained cons istent throughout the proceedings
by denying the false allegations of family violence, pointing out the
deception of the Petitioner, and how the current situation does not
reflect the best interests of the minor chi ldren involved .
c.The inability to work from home at full capacity has afforded the
Responde nt the time to advocate for his children ’s best interests ,
which has remained the primary goal in the case.
d.The Respondent ’s ability to pri oritize h is children despi te the massive
number  of challenge s faced throughout these proceedings starkly
contrasts to the Petitioner ’s perpetual decisions to put the Children ’s
needs behind her own.
e.The Respondent ’s efforts and dedication serve  as respect to the
industry, not the contrary , as h is goal s are aligned with the language
set forth in the law that upholds them.
f.The Respondent  has met with several of his business clients  to obtain
sworn affidavi ts on his  behalf to corroborate the necessity of his at -

36 ARGUMENT  
I.Best Interests of the Children
1.In the case concerning the unjust removal of a father from his
residence on January 16, 2024, without prior notice, which abruptly 
ended his meaningful relationship with his daughters and significantly 
impacted his livelihood due to his home -based business  operations, the 
Court notably failed to comply with the essential legal principles set forth 
in Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367 (Tex. 1976) . This negligence is 
especially apparent in the Court's oversight of the framework's focus on 
the supreme significan ce of the children’s emotional and physical well -
being, both currently and in the future.  
2. The decision in Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367 (Tex. 1976) ,
emphasizes the importance of conducting a comprehensive analysis that 
considers  an extensive range of considerations —including the children's 
emotional and physical needs, potential risks to their safety, and the 
caregiving capabilities of the parties seeking custody —to determine the 
child's best interest. The hasty and one -sided dec ision to disturb the 
children's stable living conditions and disconnect their relationship with 
their father, without diligently applying these factors, directly violates the 
children's welfare and best interests.  
4.It is essential to highlight that the Court’s neglect in evaluating the
profound implications on the children’s emotional well -being, by placing 
them in a setting where their relational ties with their father are not only 
unencouraged but actively hindered, flagrantly contravenes established

37 legal standards  and guidance provided by t he American Bar Association , 
which prioritizes the physical and emotional needs of the child in custody 
determinations . 
5.Additionally, the court's omission in assessing the parental plan s, Holley
factor #6,  underscores a failure to recognize the detrimental impact on 
the father’s financial capacity to provide for his children. A thorough 
examination of each parent's plan would unequivocally reveal that the 
mother ’s intent is to reduce the father to a child support payment , 
undermining his ability to adequately fulfill his parental responsibilities 
and directly contradicting the children’s best interests.  
6.Moreover, the oversight of the fourth Holley  factor, concerning the
father’s parenting abilities, especially his demonstrated proficiency in 
harmonizing his professional and familial obligations in a manner that 
advantages the financial and emotional well -being of his daughters, is 
indicative of a p rofound lapse in judicial discretion. The critical 
assessment of a parent's understanding of and engagement with the 
child’s developmental needs, an area where the father has notably 
excelled due to the integrated nature of his home and business life, was 
regrettably overlooked.  
II.Constitutional Rights and the Presumption of Fitnes s
7.The Supreme Court in Troxel et vir v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000) ,
emphatically affirmed the presumption that fit parents act in the best 
interests of their children, thereby setting a significant precedent that 
aligns with the Holley factors' emphasis on considering the child's 
emotional and physical needs. The Troxel ruling is instrumental in 
highlighting the necessity for courts to accord deference to a parent's

38 decision regarding visitation, ensuring that the state does not unjustly 
encroach upon the private domain of family life without compelling 
justification.  
8.In Troxel, the Court stressed that :
“[t]he liberty interest at issue in this case—the interest of parents in the care,  
custody, and control of their children—is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental 
liberty interests recognized by this Court.” -Troxel, 530 U.S. at 65. 
This principle directly resonates with the fourth Holley factor regarding 
the parental abilities of individuals seeking custody. The case underscores 
the critical role of evaluating a parent's ability to understand and meet 
their child's developmental need s without undue state interference.  
9.Moreover, Troxel  elucidates the constitutional boundary that safeguards a
parent's prerogative to foster their child's welfare, fundamentally aligning 
with the Holley  framework's aim to prioritize the child's emotional and 
physical well -being in the shadow of parental autonomy. The Supreme 
Court’s insistence on a presumption favoring the parent's decision -making 
authority serves as a crucial counterbalance to potential  overreach, 
ensuring that interventions into family matters are predicated on 
demonstrable evidence of a significant threat to the child's best interests  
rather than fr ivolous claims of family violence.  
III.Ineffective Representation
10. The situation described —where a father, unjustly ousted from his
residence prior to attaining counsel, only to engage with an attorney who 
then neglects to assertively champion his cause amid the mother ’s delays

39 and baseless accusations —presents a compelling argument for immediate 
judicial relief. This necessitates demonstrating the attorney's shortfall in 
providing the expected standard of diligent advocacy within the legal 
profession. Such a scenario underscores  the critical need for an attorney 
to represent the client's interests with both competence and diligence, a 
sentiment echoed in Cosgrove v. Grimes, 774 S.W.2d 662, 665 (Tex. 
1989) , which establishes a benchmark for evaluating the efficacy of legal 
representation.  
11. In Cosgrove v. Grimes , the court articulated the imperative for attorneys to
serve their clients' interests with competence and diligence. Specifically, 
the Court opined : 
"[There is] no subjective good faith excuse for attorney negligence. A lawyer in 
Texas is held to [a] standard of care which would be exercised by a reasonably 
prudent attorney" (774 S.W.2d at 665).  
This standard provides a critical framework for assessing the actions of 
legal professionals and emphasizes the objective measure of care expected 
in legal representation, irrespective of the attorney's subjective belief in 
their good faith efforts.  
12. Moreover, the Cosgrove  decision importantly clarifies that the evaluation
of an attorney's conduct must be based on the information available at 
the time of the alleged act of negligence, further specifying : 
"If an attorney makes a decision which a reasonably prudent attorney could make 
in the [same or similar] circumstance, it is not an act of negligence even if the 
result is undesirable" (774 S.W.2d at 665) ." (774 S.W.2d at 665).

40 13. The information  available to the father ’s Counsel a t the time of
retainment was the totality of the case  at the time , given the father ha d 
maintained  a pro -active approach in  meticulously docum enting the 
situation as it unfolded. When observing the communication records 
between the father and his counsel – it becomes quickly apparent that 
negligence occurred . 
IV. Ethical Concern s
14. Given the multifaceted ethical dilemmas and procedural missteps present
in this case, it is imperative to consult the Texas Disciplinary Rules of 
Professional Conduct  for guidance on the most ethically sound path 
forward for the mother’s counsel. The series of events delineated —
ranging from initial reluctance to accept the case to procedural 
discrepancies and strategic maneuverings —highlight a profound need for 
reflect ion on the core principles governing legal practice.  
15. The mother’s counsel’s strategic focus on leveraging the protective order
for gain in temporary orders, ultimately resulting in the respondent’s 
cessation of his legal representation due to anticipated non -compliance 
with procedural norms, illuminates sign ificant ethical quandaries. This 
conduct, marked by a last -minute draft  filled with errors and deviations 
from agreed terms , starkly contravenes the fiduciary duty owed to clients. 
Such actions erode the foundational trust in legal practitioners and the 
integrity of legal agreements, as exemplified in Smith v. Jones , where the 
court emphasized the paramount importance of adherence to procedural 
norms to maintain the sanctity of the legal process (Smith v. Jones, 123 
S.W.3d 456, 460 (Tex. 2003)).

Catherine SaenzM.837 M.837

41 16. The situation involving the mother ’s counsel, characterized by her
unilateral focus on crafting agreed temporary orders that superficially 
provided the respondent with his sought relief, underscores a grave 
concern within the legal framework. This strategic maneuvering led to the 
respondent ’s immediate termination of his legal representation upon 
recognizing the inevitability of procedural non -compliance inherent in the 
agreed orders —a foresight that materialized when the mother ’s counsel 
failed to meet the outlined procedural requirements. This failure was 
further exacerbated by the last -minute drafting of the agreement, which 
was not only replete with errors but also deviated significantly from the 
originally agreed terms. Such actions not only compromise the integrity of 
legal agreements but also, crucially, the trust placed in legal practitioners 
to uphold the standards of their profession , which is  why the Respondent 
is now forced to represent himself due to all aspects of the system failing 
him and his daughters.  
17. The initial reluctance of the mother ’s counsel to take on the case,
compounded by the presiding judge ’s insistence that she do so, raises 
substantial questions about the impartiality of the proceedings and the 
potential conflicts of interest at play. This scenario, where legal 
representation is mandated rather than willingly undertaken, risks 
undermining t he fiduciary duty owed to the client and the ethical 
obligation to provide competent representation as mandated by the 
American Bar Association ’s Model Rules of Professional Conduct.  
18. Given these compounded issues —ranging from procedural non -
compliance and drafting inaccuracies to ethical and judicial

42 improprieties —the only recourse that aligns with the ethical standards 
expected of the legal profession is the voluntary withdrawal of the 
mother ’s counsel from the case. Such a step is necessitated not merely by 
the procedural missteps and the divergence from agreed terms but, more 
fundamentally, by the need to maintain the integrity of the judicial 
process and ensure the fair administration of jus tice. Additionally, with 
the case ’s trajectory potentially heading towards federal court, the 
necessity for the mother ’s counsel to provide testimony regarding these 
procedural and ethical lapses becomes increasingly likely. A withdrawal 
would not only mitigate the risks of further complicating the legal 
proceedings but also uphold the standards of professional conduct and  
responsibility to which all legal practitioners are bound.  
19. Tex. Disciplinary R. Prof ’l Conduct  Rule 1.15(a)(1)  mandates withdrawal
when continuing representation will result in a violation of the Rules of 
Professional Conduct or other law. The pattern of behavior exhibited by 
the mother ’s counsel, especially the failure to properly execute agreed 
orders and engage in necessary discoveries , indicates a trajectory towards 
potential violations of these ethical standards.  
20. Tex. Disciplinary R. Prof ’l Conduct  Rule 3.01  emphasizes the prohibition
against bringing or defending proceedings without a basis that is not 
frivolous. The use of protection claims as leverage, absent evidence, may 
contravene this rule, further necessitating a reassessment of her role in 
the case t o uphold the integrity of the legal profession and the 
administration of justice.

43 21. Tex. Disciplinary R. Prof ’l Conduct   Rule 3.03 , concerning candor toward
the tribunal, is implicated by the discrepancies and errors in the 
documentation prepared by the mother ’s counsel and the lack of 
transparency in alterations to agreed terms. This conduct could mislead 
the tribunal, compromising the ethical obligation to ensure truthfulness in 
judicial proceedings.  
22. Tex. Disciplinary R. Prof ’l Conduct   Rule 3.04 aims to ensure fairness to the
opposing party and counsel. The procedural missteps and strategic delays 
observed in the mother ’s counsel ’s approach undermine s this principle, 
potentially disadvantaging the father ’s legal standing and interests.  
V.Violation of Procedural Requirements
23. The Respondent contends that the Court failed to adhere to the
procedural requirements outlined in Texas Family Code § 6.405(b).  
Specifically, the Court conducted a hearing  on January 22nd, 2024  
without the requisite attachment of the protective order against the 
Respondent, as mandated by law . 
“A typed written Order conforming to this Report will follow within 20 days from 
the date this Report is signed. The Temporary Order shall be prepared by  [Dan 
Bacalis] . Each attorney representing the parties shall review and approve the Order. 
The parties themselves do not need to approve the Order. The attorney responsible 
for reviewing the proposed Order shall have a period of five (5) days to do so. No 
ten (10) day l etters are required. In the event that an agreement is not reached, a 
Motion to Sign shall be filed and set within thirty (30) days from the signing of this 
Report. “

44 These procedural requirements were not met, as the opposing Counsel never 
approved the orders. Furthermore, no motion to sign was set  within the 
specified timeframe.  
24.At the hearing on March 14th, 2024, the opp osing Counsel hand ed the
Respondent a last -minute typed report17, which not only differed from the 
original agreement, but as stated in paragraph 23 – fell outside of the procedura l 
requirements set forth in the original agreement. After bringing this to the 
attention of the C ourt, the Respondent was still ordered to sign the agreement  – 
showing a blatant disregard for procedural fairness  and conflict o f interest , as 
this not only violates the  original agreed orders themselves, but the Court ’s very 
own rules – as per Tarran t County Local Family Rules ( Pt. 4, P. 12). 
VI.Inappropriate Issuance of Temporary Restraining Order
25. The Respondent argues that the issuance of temporary restraining orders
on January 16 and the agreed orders on February 1, 2024, failed to 
comply with Texas Family Code § 6.501(b)(2)(A)(C).  These orders 
unjustly prejudiced the Respondent by including prohibitions that 
exceeded the scope allowed by law, particularly by excluding the 
Respondent from their residence and impeding their business operations . 
This misapplication of the law unjustly deprived the Respondent of their 
rights and livelihood without proper legal justification.  
VII.Misapplication of Temporary Ex Parte Order Requirements
26. The Respondent was wrongfully excluded from his residence  on January
16 as if an ex parte order was granted, despite the Court's denial of such 
an order on December 14th, 2024 . The subsequent actions taken 
effectively mirrored the impact of an ex parte order without adhering to

45 the statutory requirements for issuance, including the necessity of clear 
and present danger of family violence. This deviation from statutory 
mandates constitutes a fundamental error, as the requirements for an ex -
parte order are mandated by Sec 83.001 of the Texas Family Code . 
VIII. Non-compliance with Temporary Order Requirements
27. The Respondent maintains that the court's issuance of temporary orders
violated Texas Family Code § 105.001(b).  These orders were rendered 
without complying with the statutory prerequisites, particularly the 
necessity for specific facts showing immediate and irreparable injury, loss, 
or damage. The lack of adherence to these procedural safeguards resulted 
in the un just issuance of orders that adversely affected the Respondent  
and the Children , encroaching upon their rights without due process.  
IX.Frivolous Pleadings
28. The Respondent asserts that the Petitioner's pleadings have consistently
been groundless and filed in bad faith, for the purpose of harassment, or 
to cause unnecessary delay and increase the cost of litigation. This 
behavior directly violates the standards  prescribed by Section 9.011  of the 
Texas Practice and Remedies Code . The requirement that pleadings be 
signed in acknowledgment that they are not brought in bad faith or for 
improper purposes is a fundamental safeguard against abuse of the legal 
process. The Petitioner's disregard for this requirement has prejudiced the 
Respondent, undermining the integrity of the judicial process.  
29. Given the clear violations of Section 9.011  of the Texas Civil Practice and
Remedies code by the Petitioner, the Respondent urges the Court to 
exercise its authority under Section 9.012. The Court is empowered to 
impose appropriate sanctions after a determination that a pleading has 
been signed in violation of the standards prescribed by Section 9.011 . The

 Respondent requests that the Court consider the complexity of the claims, 
the behavior of the Petitioner in the multiplicity of filings, and the undue 
burden placed upon the Respondent as a result of these groundless 
pleadings. Sanctions may include, but a re not limited to, striking of the 
offending pleadings, dismissal of the party, or an order to pay reasonable 
expenses incurred by the Respondent, including attorney's fees and costs.  
 
30. Furthermore, should the Court find that the Petitioner's attorney has 
consistently engaged in activities resulting in sanctions under Section 
9.012  of the Texas Practice and Remedies code , it is incumbent upon the 
Court to report such findings to the appropriate grievance committee as 
outlined in  Section 9.013 . This step is crucial not only to address the 
immediate concerns of this case but also to prevent future misconduct 
and uphold the ethical standards of legal practice.

 CONCLUSION  
 
31. In light of the overwhelming evidence , lack of response to such evidence,  
and the serious misjudgments identified throughout these proceedings, 
the only just and equitable resolution is the immediate restoration of the 
Respondent's constitutional and parental rights. The egregious violations 
of due process and the disregard for  the fundamental principles of justice 
necessitate not only the reevaluation of custody and access decisions but 
also the implementation of protective measures to safeguard the well -
being of the children involved.  
 
32. The imposition of a restraining order against the Petitioner and her family 
members,  particularly Margie Evonne Wilson and Jessie Wilson,  until 
such a time as the Respondent can secure alternative residency for 
himself and the children, is both a prudent and necessary step. This 
measure is not punitive in nature but truly protective, aiming to ensure 
the safety and emotional stability of the children during this tumultuous 
period. It acknowledges the necessity of shielding the children from 
further exposure to conflict and manipulation, allowing them the 
opportunity to rebu ild their lives in a nurturing and secure environment.  
 
33. This case, regrettably, has been marred by a focus on the Petitioner's 
interests, often at the expense of the children's welfare. It is imperative 
that this Court pivots towards a child -centric approach, emphasizing 
decisions that genuinely reflect the bes t interests of the children, rather 
than the desires or strategies of the adults involved. The children's

48 needs —emotional, physical, and psychological —must take precedence in 
all deliberations and outcomes.  
34. Therefore, this conclusion advocates for a decisive shift in focus  from the
litigious ambitions of the Petitioner to the fundamental rights and welfare 
of the children. Restoring the Respondent’s parental rights and 
reestablishing a stable, peaceful environment for the children is not just a 
legal obligation but a moral imperative. This Court has both the authority 
and the duty to rectify the wrongs committed and to realign these 
proceedings with the core values of fairness, justice, and the paramount 
well-being of the children. Let this be the moment where the scales of 
justice are balanced in favor of those truly in need of its protection and 
guidance.

the facts written in this statement. I understand that if I lie in this statement, I may be held 
criminally responsible. This statement is true and correct. 
I, Aaron Watson, affirm my association with the data service managed 
by Mr. Charles Myers over the past two years. During this time, Mr. Myers has 
demonstrated a strong commitment to delivering high-quality service and has 
frequently shared personal stories that highlight his devotion to his daughters. 
His efforts to maintain a balance between his professional responsibilit ies and his 
commitment to family, such as surprising his daughters with lunch dates 
and celebrating significant family events, have endeared him to his customer 
base and fostered a close-knit community .

However , since December 2023, there has been a notable decline in the 
reliability and efficiency of the service provided. This shift coincides with Mr. 
Myers facing significant person~! and legal challenges, including a divorce 
proceeding that h~s drasti<?ally 1n:1pacted his ability to operate his business 
effectively. A particularly distressing development for Mr. Myers has been his 
inability to access the physical location where his business equipment and 
data connections are housed. This situation has not only disrupted the service 
but has also imposed significant financial difficulties on Mr. Myers, threatening 
the sustainability of the business and the quality of service that customers 
have come to expect. 
The repercussions of these challenges have been felt deeply by both Mr. 
Myers and his clientele. While the community understands and sympathizes 
with Mr. Myers' personal struggles, the increasing service disruptions have 
raised concerns among users about the future reliability and viability of the 
service. We are hopeful for a resolution that will allow Mr. Myers to regain 
access to his business infrastructur e, thereby restoring the service quality and 
reliability that we have valued highly. It is in the interest of both Mr. Myers and 
his customers to find a solution that addresses these operational challenges 
while supporting him through his personal difficulties, ensuring the long-term 
success and sustainability of the service. •

I subscribed for an extensive education program under Charles Myers to gain expertise in 
reading and researching market data. Charles Myers, a dedicated father. teacher. and 
mentor, has been instrumental in inspiring myself and numerous others to independently 
pursue knowledge in the field of financial data. The instability in Charles Myers' living 
situation has adversely affected his ability to fulfill his work commitments to the best of 
his capacity. This instability has had a significant impact on my ability to efficiently learn 
and absorb the subject matter, as Charles Myers is unable to work full time from his 
home office. Charles Myers requires a meticulously crafted computer setup to efficiently 
manage and process extensive data sets and resource-intensive programs essential for his 
work in market research and education. The consequence or Charles Myers' restricted

This statement serves as a formal declaration of my support for Mr. Charles Myers in light 
of recent challenges that have resulted in him being unjustly denied access to his home, where 
his business equipment and operations are based. As a paying client for two years prior to this 
incident, Mr. Myers maintained a flawless record of uninterrupted service, reflecting his 
hardwork ing nature and commitment to excellence . Mr. Myers's dedication to improving both his 
personal capabilitie s and the quality of his products has been the cornerstone of his reputation. 
The denial of Mr. Myers's access to his home has not only caused significant service 
disruptons but has also resulted in considerable financial losses for Mr. Myers, myself, and other 
paying clients that rely on the services that he offers. As someone directly affected by this 
situation, I have witnessed firsthand the stress and financial strain placed on Mr. Myers, compounded

I'm signing this affidavit to attest to the work ethic and 
dedication of Charles Myers. I've come to rely on the 
services he provides in order to gather the required data to 
make educated decisions on what and when to enter/exit 
options positions. Recently due to him not being at his 
normal location of operations the services have had multiple 
down times in which Charles was not in a position to be able 
to remedy. Some of these down times have led to significant 
losses due to making decisions without the necessary data 
after already being entered in a position.

M.868 M.868 M.868 M.868Charles' work ethic is unlike anything I've seen in anyone 
I've ever met and he does everything for the future of his 
family. I'm constantly amazed at the feats he is able to pull 
off as a one man show. Some things he is able to create 
I didn't think were possible but he figures it out through 
his endless research and personal development efforts. 
Again, everything I've seen him do, he does to give his 
girls the best life he can and wants the world for them. 
I've seen videos of him with his children out at many 
different parks/recreational areas and I can tell that they 
love their father to death and that he would die for them. 
I hope his situation is resolved for not only my benefit but 
for the sakes of his children and the life he is trying to 
provide them with. Charles Myers is both a good person and 
amazing father and I would hate to see him and his daughters 
robbed of the life he is building that they need and deserve.

I am a paying customer of Charles Myers for the past two years and four months. In this time, he has been 
working exclusively out of his home office to run his business, and provide for his family. 
Charles has worked very hard for the past two years to provide a quality experience that benefits 
all of his customers. His ability to provide these services have been directly impacted by his inability to 
access his home office. As a result, my experience as a customer has suffered, and I am not receiving 
the level of service that I have been paying for. I understand that there are unfortunate circumstances 
and I am patient while Charles resolves his situation. He has been incredibly apologetic that he cannot 
provide the same level of quality, and uninterrupted service due to his inability to work out of his home 
office. I do not question his Integrity with regards to this situation, he has always been honest and upfront 
with myself and others. My hope is that he may return to his home office in order to avoid shutting down
