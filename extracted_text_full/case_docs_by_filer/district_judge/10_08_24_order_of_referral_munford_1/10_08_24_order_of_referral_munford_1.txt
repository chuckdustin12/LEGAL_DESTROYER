IN THE MATTER

OF THE MARRIAGE OF
MORGAN MICHELLE MYERS
AND CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS

MOTION FOR RECUSAL

AND IN THE INTEREST OF MARA
MYERS AND CAROLINE MYERS,
CHILDREN

TO THE HONORABLE DAVID EVANS
OF THE 8TH ADMINISTRATIVE JUDICIAL REGION OF TEXAS:

In February of 2018, response to a question posed by the Republican Club Political
Action Committee, the now elected District Judge James Munford stated:

“I’m running for this office because I’ve worked many, many years in the family law field. I want

to help and work with the citizens of Tarrant County and the families of Tarrant County to

provide a good and accurate judiciary that follows the rules of law.”
However, in this case, Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, has encountered a
series of judicial determinations that fundamentally contradict this objective. The
assurance to uphold a judiciary that follows the rule of law has been replaced with
decisions that have deprived the Respondent of due process, equitable hearings, and his
fundamental paternal rights. Respondent respectfully moves to recuse District Judge

James Munford and Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer pursuant to TAC §155.152 & TEX.

R. CIV. P § 18b(b)(1) and in support thereof , states the following un-opposed facts:

I. BASIS FOR RECUSAL

A. The impartiality of a judge may be challenged in the trial court by a motion to
recuse. TEX. R. CIV. P. 18a, 18b. The Respondent respectfully moves to recuse Honorable
Judge James Munford and Honorable Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer from presiding over
cause number 322-744263-23! for their collective inability to remain impartial in this
matter by depriving the Respondent of a fair trial on four separate appearances. “Texas
requires the recusal of a judge in any case where his or her impartiality might reasonably
be questioned, regardless of any actual bias which may be held in a case.” Aguilar v,

Anderson., 855 S.W.2d 799, 815.

B. This motion has been filed at the earliest practicable opportunity, as the
Respondent has exhausted all other available legal avenues without receiving any response,
explanation, or opposition. Respondent has given the trial court every opportunity to
correct the errors made in this case and has recently discovered pertinent information
related to the initial proceeding that took place on January 16th, 2024, as outlined below.
There are no current settings or upcoming hearings, and the case has not yet been scheduled
for a final trial. The Respondent’s motion is verified and asserts grounds for recusal
pursuant to TEX. CIV. R. P. 18(b)b1. These grounds are not predicated solely on the judges’
prior rulings. Instead, this motion presents detailed, particularized facts based on the
Respondent's direct knowledge that are admissible as evidence and are self-authenticating

&&
age

' This case was consolidated on January 16", 2024, by District Judge James Munford with cause number
322-744538-23, a protective order suit initiated by the Petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers.

2

under Rule 902(4) of the Texas Rules of Evidence and are sufficient to warrant recusal.
Moreover, where facts are presented based on information and belief, the foundation for

such beliefs is explicitly stated. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 18a(a)(1)-(4); 18a(b)(1)
Il. QUESTIONING THE IMPARTIALITY OF JAMES MUNFORD

A. On September 29th, 2024, the Respondent discovered a Facebook post made by
the Tarrant County District Courts which stated the following:

“The following Tarrant County District Courts will be closed tomorrow, Tuesday, January 16,
2024.
This list is evolving as individual Judges are making informed decisions based on their dockets,

inclement weather, and the safety and welfare of litigants, Court staff, counsel, and the general

public.” — Tarrant County District Courts on January 15, 2024.

The Fort Worth Independent School District also announced that they would remain
closed due to inclement weather in the area. https://www.fox4news.com/news/dallas-fort-
worth-school-closings-jan-16. On December 14", 2024, the petitioner requested a
protective order from James Munford, which was denied. Exhibit A. However, one month
and two days later, Judge James Munford made an initial decision that has been
unexplained for the last ten months.

B. The initial decision at issue arose during a show cause hearing concerning an
order of protection initiated by the petitioner, Morgan Michelle Myers, on December 22,
2023. This hearing was originally scheduled to be presided over by Associate Judge
Jeffrey Kaitcer in the 322" District Court of Tarrant County at 9:00 A.M. on January 16",

2024. However, due to delays caused by inclement weather as mentioned above, the

proceedings were instead conducted by District Judge James Munford, as Associate

Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer arrived late.

C. Both parties were present and appeared without legal representation. During the
proceedings, Judge Munford presented the parties with an agreed continuance, which
both parties accepted, and which was subsequently granted by Judge Munford as
reflected in his order. However, despite granting the continuance, Judge Munford went
further, issuing a series of rulings where he sua sponte consolidated the protective order
case with the divorce case previously filed by the petitioner on December 18, 2023.
Exhibit B. He ordered the Respondent to vacate the residency that same day by 2:00 p.m.,
divested him of the custody of his children, and the hearing was then rescheduled for

January 22, 2024, to be presided over by Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer. Exhibit C.

D. This decision by Judge Munford undeniably raises serious questions regarding
his impartiality in this matter. Due process of law requires that an individual receive
notice and hearing before being deprived of a property right. In re the Guardianship of
Bays, 355 $.W.3d 715, 720 (Tex. App. 2011); See Grannis v. Ordean, 234 U.S. 385, 394,
348. Ct. 779, 783, 58 L. Ed. 1363 (1914) ("a fundamental requisite of due process of law
is the opportunity to be heard"). Furthermore, the Texas Family Code prohibits such an
order before notice and hearing. TEX. FAM. CODE 105.001 (“...an order may not be
rendered under Subsection (a)(1)... except after notice and a hearing...”) (referencing

child custody).

E. Moreover, 6.405(b) of the Texas Family Code was not satisfied, which is a
mandatory requirement before any hearing can take place given the original petition for
divorce claimed an active order of protection was currently in effect against the
Respondent. Exhibit B, p. 7. (‘The petitioner shall attach to the petition a copy of each
order described by Subsection (a)(1) in which a party to the suit or the child of a party to
the suit was the applicant or victim of the conduct alleged in the application... if a copy
of the order is not available at the time of filing, the petition must state that a copy of the
order will be filed with the court before any hearing.) All of the procedural safeguards

above were disregarded by James Munford.

F, The purpose of temporary orders with injunctive relief is not to destroy the
status quo, but rather to preserve it. See Iranian Muslim Organization v. City of San
Antonio, 615 S.W.2d 202, 208 (Tex. 1981); Davis v. Huey, 571 S.W.2d 859, 862 (Tex.
1978); Citizens of Texas Sav. v. Fox Jacobs, 718 S.W.2d 2, 3 (Tex. App. 1985). Similarly
to how the temporary injunction in Coyote Lake Ranch, LLC v. City of Lubbock, 498
S.W.3d 53 (Tex. 2016) improperly denied the City its undisputed right to access
groundwater—an essential resource—Judge Munford's rulings have deprived the
Respondent of his residency, which has served not only as the family home since 2015
but also as the headquarters for his business which provided for the children — an
essential resource to their wellbeing. Furthermore, the Respondent was divested of
custodial rights to his children without justification. Like the injunction in Coyote, rather

than preserving the status quo, these initial rulings have done the opposite by depriving

the Respondent of his constitutional rights to property prior to due process of law. US
CONST. AMEND XIV, § 1; TEX CONST. ART. I, § 19. Furthermore, James Munford
prejudged critical matters that require full evidentiary hearings. TEX. FAM. CODE
105.001(b) (...an order may not be rendered under Subsection (a)(1), (2), or (5) except
after notice and a hearing.) (in regard to the temporary conservatorship for a child, for the

temporary support of the child, or for payment of attorney’s fees.)

G. The Respondent’s burden of showing of bias or impartiality to such an extent
that the movant was deprived of a fair trial is satisfied from Judge Munford’s initial
ruling. See Rodriguez v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., No. 04-14-00342-CV, 22 (Tex.

App. Jun. 17, 2015).

H. The threshold for recusal is "whether a reasonable member of the public at
large, knowing all the facts in the public domain concerning the judge's conduct, would
have a reasonable doubt that the judge is actually impartial." Hansen v. JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A., 346 S.W.3d 769, 776 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2011, no pet.); Rodriguez v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., No. 04-14-00342-CV, 22 (Tex. App. Jun. 17, 2015). The
Respondent asserts that a reasonable member of the public would indeed reasonably
doubt James Munford was actually impartial given that he deprived the Respondent of a
fair trial. Thus, the Respondent’s burden and threshold for recusal has been met, and

Judge James Munford should be recused from this matter.

I. The only reasoning provided was an oral statement regarding his personal

opinion regarding the Respondent living next door to his ex-partner’s grandparents,

which is extrajudicial and comes from a biased perspective which discounted the facts of
the case relevant to the children’s well-being. In the context of this case, recusal is
warranted if the trial judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned, or he has a
personal bias. TEX. R. CIV. P. 18b(2). This opinion or bias was irrelevant to the well
being of the children, as the grandmother, much like the children, relied on the
Respondent’s income in order to provide financial stability, and further justifies his

recusal.
ITI. QUESTIONING THE IMPARTIALITY OF JEFFREY KAITCER

A. The initial ruling reset the case to January 224, 2024. The Respondent retained
the services of Dan Bacalis, while the Petitioner arrived without any legal representation
and retained the services of Cooper Carter in the lobby of the courtroom. Much like the
first setting, Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer granted a continuance which only benefitted
the petitioner by allowing her legal representation more time to become familiar with the
case while simultaneously extending the initial orders of Judge James Munford to
February 1“, 2024, which significantly impacted the Respondent and his children. Exhibit
D. Neither party appeared before the Jeffrey Kaitcer, and this decision was made without

any input from the Respondent and without any opportunity to contest it.

B. At the third trial setting on February 1, 2024, the parties arrived only to be
presented with a settlement agreement from the Respondent’s own counsel. Given that
the case had been delayed twice already and the ongoing damage from being unable to
work at full capacity was compounding by the day, the Respondent contested this

7

strategy. He was informed by his attorney that the orders could be modified later and was
urged to sign it. Left with no better alternative, the Respondent signed the agreement
under duress after already being deprived of his residency, children, and business since

January 16", 2024. Exhibit E

C. The agreement removed the children from their own home that they had resided
in their entire life and allowed the Respondent back into the home until March 1, 2024. It
also established child support, and allocated financial responsibilities to the parties, to
where the Respondent was left with both car payments, an unreasonable amount of time

to transition from the home and with the addition of child support obligations. Exhibit E

D. Due to the Respondent’s counsel drafting a settlement agreement rather than
representing the interests of his client, he was terminated shortly after the third setting on
February 5, 2024, where the Respondent began to represent himself pro se. Exhibit F He
filed a motion to reconsider the associate judge’s report for temporary orders on February
9, 2024, which wasn’t set for hearing until March 14 due to unnecessary delay by the
opposing counsel, Cooper Carter, who has not filed any pleadings in this case on behalf

of the petitioner. Exhibit G

E. Given that Dan Bacalis had been terminated, and that the associate judge’s
report signed on February 1, 2024, had clear stipulations regarding its’ reduction to
writing Exhibit G, p.5, the Respondent filed notice with the court on March 4", 2024,
stating that he would not be leaving the marital residence as it was not in the best

interests of his children. Exhibit H

F. This decision prompted the petitioner to run inside the family residence on
March 6", 2024, while the Respondent was walking his daughters to school on her
visitation time and lock the petitioner out of the home. Since this day, the Respondent has
pursued relief to no avail, without argument, and without any response or findings of

facts from either judge or Cooper Carter, petitioner’s counsel.

G. On March 14, 2024, the parties appeared before Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer
to address the Respondent's motion to reconsider. Just minutes prior to the hearing, the
Respondent was served formally reduced temporary orders by Cooper L. Carter, which
contained significant clerical discrepancies and deviated from the original orders signed
on February 1, 2024. These orders are currently in effect today as ‘agreed orders’. Exhibit

I. The orders also reference a hearing that was never conducted in this case.

H. During the hearing, the Respondent was precluded from addressing the events
leading up to February 1, 2024, due to sustained objections based on relevance. Despite
signing off on the Associate Judge’s Report which non-suited the protective order, the
opposing counsel was nonetheless permitted to elicit testimony from their client
regarding her purported fear for safety should Respondent be allowed near the residency,

which has not been supported by any evidence to date.

I. Judge Kaitcer refused to admit the Respondent's exhibits, which included
affidavits from business clients prepared to attest to his need for residency and his close
relationship with his daughters. Exhibit J. Judge Kaitcer further stated in open court,

while drafting his ruling on the Respondent's motion, "You don’t care about your kids.

You just care about your business." This remark, devoid of any evidentiary basis, exposed
a deep-seated bias that rendered impartial adjudication impossible. A neutral and
impartial evaluator would have acknowledged the interconnected nature of the
Respondent's business, residency, and familial relationships as well as the impact of the
initial proceedings leading up to that point. Further, an impartial judge would have
realized that there is no logical explanation to remove a parent who relies on the
residency to provide for the children while simultaneously denying the evidence that

would have corroborated this need.

J. The Respondent's motion for reconsideration concluded with an illegible order,
requiring him to sign the temporary orders served just moments earlier by 1:30 p.m. that
same day. Exhibit K. Again, the order was designated as "agreed" despite lacking the
Respondent's signature, was reduced outside of its’ own procedural requirements ordered
by the same judge, was reduced without any underlying motion for temporary orders ever
served to the Respondent and differed from the associate judge’s report signed on
February 1, 2024. Rather than holding the opposing counsel and the petitioner in
contempt for violating Rule 13 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure for signing a
fictitious pleading which contained false statements, Jeffrey Kaitcer deprived the

Respondent of a fair trial, thus warranting his recusal from this matter.

K. It is evident, based on common sense and objective evaluation of the public
facts regarding Jeffrey Kaitcer’s conduct that no reasonable person would believe that he

was actually impartial knowing all of the facts of the case. After eight months of seeking

10

relief throughout the Texas judiciary, the collective actions of Judge James Munford and
Associate Judge Jeffrey Kaitcer remain unexplained, and the damage is ongoing. Their
joint recusal is necessary to ensure a fair resolution of this matter and to ensure the

persistent favoritism directed towards the petitioner is abolished.
IV. THE AFTERMATH

A. Since the March 14" hearing, the case has stalled. There has been no
participation from the opposing party, and all attempted communications have failed.
There hasn’t been any explanation for the denials in the Second Court of Appeals, leaving
the Respondent to continue seeking every remedy available to him to correct the

decisions presented above or receive a valid legal basis that justifies them.

B. The joint managing conservatorship that the current orders outline has put the
Respondent in massive amounts of debt. He had to stay in hotels on Thursday nights in
order to take his Children to school on Friday mornings for his visitation period, and for
the extended summer visitation, rented an AIR BNB in order to provide the Children with
a stable living space. The Respondent was able to have the owner of the AIRBNB located
at 6608 Dewsbury St. that was only 1.3 miles from the Respondent’s home allow him to
port forward the router, allowing him to work to some degree, where he stayed until
September 14", 2024. Given the requirements to operate his business, an alternative
residency would take a fair amount of time to transition to, and likewise the petitioner

would need equal amount of time to obtain full employment in order to maintain the

11

current household. All of this was explained in the Respondent’s pleadings that were

before the court on January 16", 2024, but were not considered. Exhibit L, Exhibit M

C. Since the March 14" hearing, the petitioner has moved additional family
members into the home, has not paid rent, and has reduced her employment while
significantly reducing the Respondents. On top of both James Munford and Jeffrey
Kaitcer’s disregard for the law and the best interests of the children, the inadvertent
favoritism towards the petitioner has allowed her to further her own interests at the
expense of the status quo of the children. An impartial judge is required in this matter to

ensure that this one-sided favoritism does not continue at the expense of the children.

D. On June 2 of 2024, the petitioner’s grandmother contacted the Respondent
reiterating the above. She stated that the children were not being taken care of, that the
petitioner was not acting like herself, and that she was not paying rent. This information
was relayed to the Supreme Court of Texas, where the Respondent’s motion for rehearing
on petition for writ of mandamus is still pending before the court, asking them to compel
James Munford to vacate the current orders which were entered by Associate Judge
Jeffrey Kaitcer as agreed without consent and referenced a hearing that has never taken

place.
V. QUESTIONS THAT REMAIN UNANSWERED
Throughout this case, several concerning questions have arisen regarding the conduct

of both judges:

12

. What dire circumstance compelled Judge James Munford to take up a case on
short notice and grant injunctions and make child custody decisions without
knowing the facts or considering the pleadings, particularly on a day the court was
closed due to inclement weather when he had denied a similar request a month

earlier?

. Why did Judge Munford grant an agreed continuance at a protective order hearing
and simultaneously rule against one of the parties on divorce issues without taking

into consideration the preponderance of the evidence before him?

. What factual basis on the record compelled Jeffrey Kaitcer to openly make

negative statements about the Respondent regarding his children?

. Why has Cooper Carter failed to respond to any of the Respondent’s pleadings and

neglected to file any documents on behalf of her client?

. What factual basis exists on the record to supports the petitioner being granted full

custody of the children and sole use of the residence?

. How can an order be issued as an "agreed order" after consent was explicitly
withdrawn, referencing a hearing that never occurred, and served to the

Respondent before a scheduled hearing meant to challenge the very order?

13

VI. CONCLUSION

This case, as detailed in the pending motion for rehearing before the Supreme
Court of Texas, revolves around the core issue of accountability. What began with
Morgan Michelle Myers attempting to avoid responsibility has now evolved into a
troubling scenario where both judges have repeatedly failed to recognize and correct their
serious missteps. Attorney Cooper Carter’s authority to represent the petitioner, currently
being challenged through a Rule 12 motion, further deepens concerns about the integrity

and fairness of these proceedings.

Recusing both judges is not just a procedural necessity, but a crucial step toward
ensuring that this case is reviewed impartially and that the facts are properly considered.
This will allow the court to focus on the petitioner’s pattern of deception and, more
importantly, what truly serves the best interests of the children. The petitioner’s actions
have caused unnecessary delays, destabilized her family, and inflicted significant
emotional and financial harm on all involved. The ongoing litigation, exacerbated by a

lack of judicial transparency and accountability, has only added to the hardship.

Despite these issues, the Respondent holds no ill will toward any party involved.
His primary concern has always been, and continues to be, doing what is right for his
children. The Respondent believes that with impartial judges and a renewed focus on
fairness, this case can still be resolved justly, allowing all parties to move forward with
dignity and integrity. The Respondent remains diligent in his commitment to securing a

fair outcome that reflects the best interests of his children as the Family Code mandates.

14

VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

The Respondent respectfully requests the following relief:

1. That the clerk of the court deliver a copy of the motion for recusal to both the
respondent judges and the regional presiding judge, and deliver any signed orders

of recusal or referral to the regional presiding judge immediately upon filing.

2. That the respondent judges either recuse themselves or refer the motion to the
regional presiding judge within three business days after the motion is filed, and
refrain from taking any further action in the case until the motion is decided,

unless good cause is shown in writing or on the record.

3. That the regional presiding judge issue interim orders to reset the status quo by
allowing the Respondent’s immediate return to his home and business, thereby

initiating a peaceful transitionary period for the family’s well-being and stability.

4. That the motion for recusal be conducted by telephone, as permitted by Rule
18(g)(6)(C), to expedite the process and ensure all documents submitted by
facsimile or email, if otherwise admissible under the rules of evidence, are

considered.

5. That, if the motion is granted, the regional presiding judge reassign the case to
another court or assign another judge to ensure fairness and impartiality moving

forward.

15

The Respondent seeks this relief to ensure that the case proceeds in a just manner,

restoring stability and allowing a fair resolution to the matter at hand during the pendency

of the case.
