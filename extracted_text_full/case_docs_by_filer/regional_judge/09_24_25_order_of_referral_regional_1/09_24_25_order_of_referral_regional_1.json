GROUNDS FOR RECUSAL \nThe Regional Presiding Judge has permitted and recklessly tolerated an ongoing RICO \nEnterprise that continues to expand within the Texas Judiciary due to the collective and willful \nneglect by the enjoined individuals to uphold their mandatory duties. By neglecting the \nresponsibilities of his position of power, David L. Evans has inadvertently aided in the furtherance \nof the RICO enterprise's primary objective: to secure a fraudulent final decree of divorce and \nescape accountability. \nAs the record establishes, the Respondent has exhausted every appellate and administrative \nremedy in an attempt to seek redress. Unopposed relief continues to be denied, and more predicate \nacts in furtherance of the enterprise's affairs continue to occur. \nFor the forthcoming reasons, David L. Evans must recuse from this matter: \nExhffiit 1 \nPage 2 of 16",

      "text": "II. GROUNDS FOR RECUSAL \nA. Disregard for Recusal Procedure \n1. Texas law mandates strict adherence to procedural safeguards in the recusal process to \nensure both actual and apparent judicial impartiality. When a court coordinator-who is not a \nneutral party and serves at the pleasure of the judge subject to recusal-handles the \nadministrative delivery of a recusal motion, this contravenes the explicit requirements of Rule \n18a(e) and creates an appearance of impropriety. \n2. David L. Evans has allowed the coordinator Lindsey Baker -not the clerk -to handle \nthe duties the legislature explicitly designates to court clerks. Rule 18a(e)(2) plainly states that \n\" ... when a respondent judge signs and files an order of recusal or referral, the clerk of the court \nmust immediately deliver a copy to the regional presiding judge.\" \n3. Furthermore, as Rule 18(a)(f)(3) also plainly states, \" .. .ifthe respondent judge fails to \ncomply with a duty imposed by this rule, the movant may notify the regional presiding judge.\" \n4. Here, the Regional Presiding Judge was notified of and provided with a modified \nversion of the recusal motion rather than the original, and was notified of these discrepancies, but \nchose to ignore them. \nB. Recusal Tampering \n5. The record facially establishes that on October 7, 2024, the Respondent filed a Joint \nMotion to Recuse Honorable Judges James Munford and Jeffrey Kaitcer from the matter and \nprovided supporting evidence which is self-authenticating under the Texas Rules of Evidence. \n6. The following day, on October 8 at 4:42 P.M., correspondence was received from court \ncoordinator Lindsey Baker regarding the order of referral. REC. 1277 \n3 \nExhibit 1 \nPage 3 of 16",

Upon inspection, it was discovered that the affidavit and exhibits were both missing \nfrom the motion which was sent to the Regional Judge, and this was quickly pointed out to the \ncoordinator. \n8. She confirms that the exhibits were indeed filed electronically but as the clerk's office \nprefers-they were filed as one document,just as the Tarrant County District Clerk's Filing FAQ \nstates: \nQ: \"What process should be used for eFiling exhibits?\" \nA: \"Same process for exhibit as initial filings-Exhibits should be merged into one \ndocument with the lead document.\" REC. 1262. \nC. Repeated Tampering \n9. The record facially shows that on October 10, 2024, Judge James Munford filed an \n\"Amended Order of Referral\" and once again the correspondence to David L Evans was handled \nby the coordinator. \n10. This time, the coordinator claimed that due to the \"size of the motion\" that it could be \njustified to split the motion into three separate files, this time with the exhibits and affidavit \nincluded, defeating the entire purpose of removing the exhibits and affidavit two days earlier. \nREC. 1282 \nD. Objecting \n11. All of these issues were raised in both notice and an objection filed timely after these \nissues were discovered. REC. 1245-1252 It included all email exchanges with the coordinator, \nthe modifications of the original motion, with the objection specifically stating that \"the \nexplanation changed to the document being too large. This inconsistency raises concerns about \ntransparency and procedural fairness.\" No action was taken by David Evans. \nExhibit 1 \nPage 4 of 16",

After waiting four months for the judges to be reinstated as per David Evans' order, \nRespondent had to reach out to the court coordinator to remind her to reinstate the trial judges. \nREC. 1306. \n13. The Respondent, in the face of a serious dental emergency for his youngest child, \nopened a separate SAPCR suit, arguing for dominant jurisdiction, (REC. 2088) only to be denied \naccess to the courts by Judges Kate Stone and Kenneth Newell, which prevented an emergency \nTRO needed for the safety and welfare of the Respondent's children. This negligence lead to a \ndirect injury to the youngest child in this case and three concurrent mandamus petitions \nfollowed, none of which received any response from the implicated Judges. See 25-0361, 25-\n0367, 25-0378. \n14. In the midst of these efforts, James Munford continued to ignore the issues and after \nthe SAPCR was improperly consolidated by Judge Newell, Judge Munford chose to move the \ncase towards final deposition, which was promptly objected to and ignored the same. REC. 2480. \n15. These actions lead to the second recusal motion, facially naming James Munford as \nthe respondent judge. REC. 2488. \n16. This time, David Evans addressed two major issues raised in an objection by the \nRespondent: \ni. The continued involvement of Lindsey Baker, the court coordinator; \nii. The erroneous order of referral sent by Judge Kaitcer; REC. 2620 \n17. In his order, he argued that \n\"The court coordinators and clerks work together to assist the trial judges and the administrative \njudges. Only the judges, not the litigants, have the authority to direct the activities of the court \ncoordinators and clerks. Mr. Myers' objections regarding the involvement are overruled\" REC. \n3507. \n5 \nExhibit 1 \nPage 5 of 16",

This argument fails-because the rules of procedure does not designate any role to \nthe Court Coordinator, and based on prior conduct -her involvement has facially created \nambiguity in a process designed to promote transparency and fairness. By refusing to comply \nwith the Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure in multiple recusal proceedings-there \nis no question regarding his impartiality- it has been compromised by, what the Respondent \nbelieves to be, political reasons. \n19. Even when raising these issues to the highest Court in the State on direct appeal, \nleading to cause numbers 25-0426 and 25-0458, which related to compliance with Rule 18a and \nthe entertainment and subsequent denial of a motion which was never filed, resulting in five \nconcurrent mandamus petitions before the Texas Supreme Court. \n20. All that was received in response to these efforts was \"Denied, per curiam\". \nRespondent understands that the Court of appeals has the discretion to issue such explanations, \nhowever, given the scope of these issues, they cannot be addressed at final disposition, and based \non everything above, there no reasonable possibility that one would think that there could be a \nfair and impartial trial given these circumstances. This will only lead to further appeals and more \nwasted judicial resources when these issues could just be dealt with at present. \n21. The regional judge's repeated failure to follow mandatory recusal procedures-by \ndenying hearings on recusal motions, involving non-neutral staff, and failing to provide \nmeaningful appellate remedies-constitutes a pattern of procedural irregularities that violates \nboth statutory requirements and the fundamental due process right to a fair and impartial \ntribunal. Texas law is clear that recusal is required whenever a judge's conduct creates reasonable \ndoubt as to impartiality, and the deprivation of a meaningful appellate remedy further supports \nthe necessity of recusal to protect the substantive rights of the parties and restore confidence in \nExhff>it 1 \nPage 6 of 16",

As a direct result of these procedural violations and Judge Evans' failure to remedy them, \nI have suffered substantial harm, including but not limited to: \na.
