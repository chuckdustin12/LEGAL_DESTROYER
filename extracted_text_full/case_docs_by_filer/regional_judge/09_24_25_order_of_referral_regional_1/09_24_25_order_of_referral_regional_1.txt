§ MOTION TO RECUSE 
THE REGIONAL PRESIDING 
JUDGE 
TO THE HONORABLE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS: 
COMES NOW, Respondent, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, who respectfully submits 
this Motion to Recuse the Regional Presiding Judge, David L. Evans, and in support thereof, 
shows the Court the following: 
Since December of 2023, Respondent has pied time and time again regarding a fraudulent 
scheme to divest him of his business and property that began with Morgan Michelle Myers and 
Daniel Kenneth Branthoover, involving interstate travel and communications. 
Each time the Respondent has utilized a legal pathway, he has been met with unjustifiable 
conduct that has, by its' very nature, willfully expanded the scope of the initial Myers­
Branthoover enterprise into what it is today - a collection of officials, attorneys, and court staff 
members that who -when presented with unrefuted facts, and were made aware of the fraudulent 
scheme- chose to become entangled with the enterprise's affairs. 
It is ofupmost importance to our judicial system that the following issues be adjudicated, 
and a fair and impartial judge preside over this matter who will not tolerate such behavior. 
1 
Exhibit 1 
Page 1 of 16

I. SCOPE 
The factual allegations raised herein are not conclusory and are supported by the record 
directly. Furthermore, given that Respondent has filed six mandamus petitions naming 
Honorables James Munford, Jeffrey Kaitcer, Kenneth Newell, Kate Stone, David Evans, and 
John Cayce as respondents, the record exists within the public domain and can be found here: 
https://search.txcourts.gov/SearchMedia.aspx?MediaVersionID=8e2d45b4-fb4f-40a0- 93bc-
ed9ed5f3cebd&coa=cossup&DT=RECORD&Media1D=804ac8d3-9b5f-40b0-bc4 l-
bbc08c814365 
Those who have been made aware of the fraudulent scheme but have inadvertently 
furthered its' affairs amount to two district judges, two associate judges, two visiting retired 
judges, the regional presiding judge, two court coordinators, one deputy clerk, and a licensed 
attorney, forming an associate-in-fact enterprise for purposes of RICO, as explained below. 
Il. GROUNDS FOR RECUSAL 
The Regional Presiding Judge has permitted and recklessly tolerated an ongoing RICO 
Enterprise that continues to expand within the Texas Judiciary due to the collective and willful 
neglect by the enjoined individuals to uphold their mandatory duties. By neglecting the 
responsibilities of his position of power, David L. Evans has inadvertently aided in the furtherance 
of the RICO enterprise's primary objective: to secure a fraudulent final decree of divorce and 
escape accountability. 
As the record establishes, the Respondent has exhausted every appellate and administrative 
remedy in an attempt to seek redress. Unopposed relief continues to be denied, and more predicate 
acts in furtherance of the enterprise's affairs continue to occur. 
For the forthcoming reasons, David L. Evans must recuse from this matter: 
Exhffiit 1 
Page 2 of 16

II. GROUNDS FOR RECUSAL 
A. Disregard for Recusal Procedure 
1. Texas law mandates strict adherence to procedural safeguards in the recusal process to 
ensure both actual and apparent judicial impartiality. When a court coordinator-who is not a 
neutral party and serves at the pleasure of the judge subject to recusal-handles the 
administrative delivery of a recusal motion, this contravenes the explicit requirements of Rule 
18a(e) and creates an appearance of impropriety. 
2. David L. Evans has allowed the coordinator Lindsey Baker -not the clerk -to handle 
the duties the legislature explicitly designates to court clerks. Rule 18a(e)(2) plainly states that 
" ... when a respondent judge signs and files an order of recusal or referral, the clerk of the court 
must immediately deliver a copy to the regional presiding judge." 
3. Furthermore, as Rule 18(a)(f)(3) also plainly states, " .. .ifthe respondent judge fails to 
comply with a duty imposed by this rule, the movant may notify the regional presiding judge." 
4. Here, the Regional Presiding Judge was notified of and provided with a modified 
version of the recusal motion rather than the original, and was notified of these discrepancies, but 
chose to ignore them. 
B. Recusal Tampering 
5. The record facially establishes that on October 7, 2024, the Respondent filed a Joint 
Motion to Recuse Honorable Judges James Munford and Jeffrey Kaitcer from the matter and 
provided supporting evidence which is self-authenticating under the Texas Rules of Evidence. 
6. The following day, on October 8 at 4:42 P.M., correspondence was received from court 
coordinator Lindsey Baker regarding the order of referral. REC. 1277 
3 
Exhibit 1 
Page 3 of 16

7. Upon inspection, it was discovered that the affidavit and exhibits were both missing 
from the motion which was sent to the Regional Judge, and this was quickly pointed out to the 
coordinator. 
8. She confirms that the exhibits were indeed filed electronically but as the clerk's office 
prefers-they were filed as one document,just as the Tarrant County District Clerk's Filing FAQ 
states: 
Q: "What process should be used for eFiling exhibits?" 
A: "Same process for exhibit as initial filings-Exhibits should be merged into one 
document with the lead document." REC. 1262. 
C. Repeated Tampering 
9. The record facially shows that on October 10, 2024, Judge James Munford filed an 
"Amended Order of Referral" and once again the correspondence to David L Evans was handled 
by the coordinator. 
10. This time, the coordinator claimed that due to the "size of the motion" that it could be 
justified to split the motion into three separate files, this time with the exhibits and affidavit 
included, defeating the entire purpose of removing the exhibits and affidavit two days earlier. 
REC. 1282 
D. Objecting 
11. All of these issues were raised in both notice and an objection filed timely after these 
issues were discovered. REC. 1245-1252 It included all email exchanges with the coordinator, 
the modifications of the original motion, with the objection specifically stating that "the 
explanation changed to the document being too large. This inconsistency raises concerns about 
transparency and procedural fairness." No action was taken by David Evans. 
Exhibit 1 
Page 4 of 16

E. Subsequent Recusals 
12. After waiting four months for the judges to be reinstated as per David Evans' order, 
Respondent had to reach out to the court coordinator to remind her to reinstate the trial judges. 
REC. 1306. 
13. The Respondent, in the face of a serious dental emergency for his youngest child, 
opened a separate SAPCR suit, arguing for dominant jurisdiction, (REC. 2088) only to be denied 
access to the courts by Judges Kate Stone and Kenneth Newell, which prevented an emergency 
TRO needed for the safety and welfare of the Respondent's children. This negligence lead to a 
direct injury to the youngest child in this case and three concurrent mandamus petitions 
followed, none of which received any response from the implicated Judges. See 25-0361, 25-
0367, 25-0378. 
14. In the midst of these efforts, James Munford continued to ignore the issues and after 
the SAPCR was improperly consolidated by Judge Newell, Judge Munford chose to move the 
case towards final deposition, which was promptly objected to and ignored the same. REC. 2480. 
15. These actions lead to the second recusal motion, facially naming James Munford as 
the respondent judge. REC. 2488. 
16. This time, David Evans addressed two major issues raised in an objection by the 
Respondent: 
i. The continued involvement of Lindsey Baker, the court coordinator; 
ii. The erroneous order of referral sent by Judge Kaitcer; REC. 2620 
17. In his order, he argued that 
"The court coordinators and clerks work together to assist the trial judges and the administrative 
judges. Only the judges, not the litigants, have the authority to direct the activities of the court 
coordinators and clerks. Mr. Myers' objections regarding the involvement are overruled" REC. 
3507. 
5 
Exhibit 1 
Page 5 of 16

18. This argument fails-because the rules of procedure does not designate any role to 
the Court Coordinator, and based on prior conduct -her involvement has facially created 
ambiguity in a process designed to promote transparency and fairness. By refusing to comply 
with the Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure in multiple recusal proceedings-there 
is no question regarding his impartiality- it has been compromised by, what the Respondent 
believes to be, political reasons. 
19. Even when raising these issues to the highest Court in the State on direct appeal, 
leading to cause numbers 25-0426 and 25-0458, which related to compliance with Rule 18a and 
the entertainment and subsequent denial of a motion which was never filed, resulting in five 
concurrent mandamus petitions before the Texas Supreme Court. 
20. All that was received in response to these efforts was "Denied, per curiam". 
Respondent understands that the Court of appeals has the discretion to issue such explanations, 
however, given the scope of these issues, they cannot be addressed at final disposition, and based 
on everything above, there no reasonable possibility that one would think that there could be a 
fair and impartial trial given these circumstances. This will only lead to further appeals and more 
wasted judicial resources when these issues could just be dealt with at present. 
21. The regional judge's repeated failure to follow mandatory recusal procedures-by 
denying hearings on recusal motions, involving non-neutral staff, and failing to provide 
meaningful appellate remedies-constitutes a pattern of procedural irregularities that violates 
both statutory requirements and the fundamental due process right to a fair and impartial 
tribunal. Texas law is clear that recusal is required whenever a judge's conduct creates reasonable 
doubt as to impartiality, and the deprivation of a meaningful appellate remedy further supports 
the necessity of recusal to protect the substantive rights of the parties and restore confidence in 
Exhff>it 1 
Page 6 of 16

the judicial process. The authorities provided leave no doubt that adherence to recusal procedures 
is essential to the integrity of the Texas judicial system. 
III. CONCLUSION AND PRAYER 
Respondent has suffered significant damages, which continue to accrue, and unexplained 
and unethical behavior continues to run afoul within this administrative region. He has provided 
the Court and several judicial officers with multiple opportunities in tandem with the information 
needed to address these pressing issues, but rather than address them, they continue to compound 
these issues for unknown reasons. 
Therefore, for all reasons stated herein, Respondent respectfully pray that this Honorable 
Court: 
I. Grant this motion to recuse; 
2. Effectuate a stay of these proceedings immediately to preserve the integrity of 
the Texas judiciary; 
3. Provide interim relief to the Respondent pursuant to Rule 18a(g)(4) that 
restores his property interests; 
4. Require the Petitioner and her counsel, for the first time in this matter, be 
required to provide a written response; 
5. Provide any further relief the Court deems just and right under these 
circumstances. 
Respectfully,

AFFIDAVIT OF CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS 
INTRODUCTION AND VERIFICATION 
I, CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS, being of sound mind and over the age of eighteen (18) 
years, hereby swear and affirm under penalty of perjury pursuant to Texas Civil Practice and 
Remedies Code § 132.001 that I am personally familiar with the facts stated herein, that I have 
personal knowledge of the matters stated in this affidavit, that the statements made herein are 
true and correct, and that I am competent to make this affidavit. 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
1. I am the Respondent in cause number 322-744263-23, styled "Morgan Michelle Myers v. 
Charles Dustin Myers," currently pending in the 322nd District Court of Tarrant County, 
Texas. 
2. Since December of 2023, I have repeatedly attempted to address a fraudulent scheme to 
divest me of my business and property interests through proper legal channels. Each time 
I have utilized legitimate legal pathways, I have been met with procedural irregularities 
and violations that have prevented fair adjudication of my claims. 
3. The Regional Presiding Judge, Honorable David L. Evans, has been directly involved in 
handling multiple recusal proceedings related to my case, and has consistently failed to 
follow the mandatory procedures required by Texas law, as detailed below. 
4. I have exhausted all available appellate and administrative remedies in my attempts to 
seek redress. Despite filing multiple mandamus petitions with the Texas Supreme Court 
(cause numbers 25-0361, 25-0367, 25-0378, 25-0426, and 25-0458), I have received only 
"Denied, per curiam" responses without substantive consideration of the serious 
procedural violations occurring in my case. 
Exhf/bit 1 
Page 8 of 16

PROCEDURAL VIOLATIONS 
5. On October 7, 2024, I filed a Joint Motion to Recuse Honorable Judges James Munford 
and Jeffrey Kaitcer, including supporting evidence and a properly executed affidavit as 
required by Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a. 
6. On October 8, 2024, at 4:42 P.M., I received correspondence from court coordinator 
Lindsey Baker regarding the order of referral. Upon inspection, I discovered that both my 
affidavit and supporting exhibits had been removed from the motion that was sent to 
Regional Judge Evans. 
7. I immediately notified the court coordinator that the exhibits and affidavit were missing 
from the materials sent to Judge Evans. The coordinator confirmed that my exhibits were 
indeed filed electronically as one document with the lead document, in accordance with 
the Tarrant County District Clerk's Filing FAQ, which states: "Same process for exhibit as 
initial filings-Exhibits should be merged into one document with the lead document." 
8. On October 10, 2024, Judge James Munford filed an "Amended Order of Referral," and 
once again the correspondence to Judge Evans was handled by the court coordinator 
Lindsey Baker rather than the clerk of the court as required by Rule 18a(e)(2). 
9. This time, the coordinator claimed that the "size of the motion" justified splitting it into 
three separate files, this time including the exhibits and affidavit that had been previously 
omitted, thereby contradicting the earlier handling of the motion. 
10. These actions directly violated Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a(e)(2), which explicitly 
states: "When a respondent judge signs and files an order ofrecusal or referral, the clerk 
of the court must immediately deliver a copy to the regional presiding judge." 
9 
Exhibit 1 
Page 9 of 16

11. The law does not permit a court coordinator, who serves at the pleasure of the judge 
subject to recusal, to handle this sensitive procedural matter. Instead of the neutral clerk 
of court processing these materials as required by statute, the court coordinator for the 
very judge whose impartiality was being questioned took possession of and modified the 
recusal motion. 
OBJECTIONS AND LACK OF REMEDY 
12. I timely filed formal objections to these procedural irregularities, including 
documentation of all email exchanges with the coordinator and the modifications made to 
my original motion. 
13. My objection specifically stated that "the explanation changed to the document being too 
large. This inconsistency raises concerns about transparency and procedural fairness." 
14. Judge Evans took no action to remedy these procedural violations despite being properly 
notified of them. 
15. After waiting four months for the judges to be reinstated as per Judge Evans' order, I had 
to personally reach out to the court coordinator to remind her to reinstate the trial judges. 
16. When I filed a second recusal motion naming Judge Munford as the respondent judge, 
Judge Evans issued an order addressing my objections regarding: 
a. The continued involvement of Lindsey Baker, the court coordinator; and 
b. The erroneous order of referral sent by Judge Kaitcer. 
17. In his order, Judge Evans stated: "The court coordinators and clerks work together to 
assist the trial judges and the administrative judges. Only the judges, not the litigants, 
have the authority to direct the activities of the court coordinators and clerks. Mr. Myers' 
objections regarding the involvement are overruled." 
Exh10it 1 
Page 10 of 16

18. This reasoning directly contradicts the plain language of Rule 18a of the Texas Rules of 
Civil Procedure, which does not designate any role to the court coordinator in the recusal 
process, and instead explicitly assigns these duties to the clerk of the court. 
PATTERN OF CONDUCT AND HARM 
19. As a direct result of these procedural violations and Judge Evans' failure to remedy them, 
I have suffered substantial harm, including but not limited to: 
a. Being denied access to the courts when I sought emergency relief for my 
youngest child who was facing a serious dental emergency; 
b. Being denied the opportunity for a fair hearing on my recusal motions; 
c. Having my properly filed motions improperly modified before being presented 
to the decision-maker; 
d. Being subjected to biased handling of critical procedural matters by non-neutral 
staff members who serve at the pleasure of the judges whose impartiality I was 
challenging; and 
e. Suffering financial harm through the continued deprivation of my property and 
business interests while these procedural violations remain unaddressed. 
20. In the face of a serious dental emergency for my youngest child, I opened a separate 
SAPCR suit, arguing for dominant jurisdiction, only to be denied access to the courts by 
Judges Kate Stone and Kenneth Newell, which prevented an emergency TRO needed for 
the safety and welfare of my children. This negligence led to a direct injury to my 
youngest child. 
11 
Exhibit 1 
Page 11 of 16

21. After the SAPCR was improperly consolidated by Judge Newell, Judge Munford moved 
the case toward final disposition, which I promptly objected to. My objections were 
ignored. 
22. This pattern of procedural violations has persisted despite my repeated, documented 
efforts to seek proper administration of justice through the channels provided by Texas 
law. 
LEGAL AUTHORITIES 
23. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 18a establishes mandatory procedures for the recusal of 
judges, including the requirement that "the clerk of the court must immediately deliver a 
copy [of the recusal motion] to the regional presiding judge" under Rule 18a(e)(2). 
24. The Texas Constitution Article V, Section 1-a provides that judges may be removed for 
incompetence, partiality, oppression, official misconduct, or failure to execute their 
official duties. 
25. Texas Government Code§ 33.001 defines judicial misconduct to include willful or 
persistent violation of rules promulgated by the Supreme Court of Texas and willful or 
persistent conduct that is clearly inconsistent with the proper performance of judicial 
duties. 
26. Texas Penal Code § 39.02 prohibits abuse of official capacity by public servants, 
providing that a public servant commits an offense if, with intent to harm another, they 
intentionally or knowingly violate a law relating to their office. 
27. Texas Penal Code§ 39.03 prohibits official oppression, stating that a public servant 
commits an offense if they intentionally deny or impede another in the exercise of their 
rights, privileges, powers, or immunities, knowing their conduct is unlawful. 
Exh1~t 1 
Page 12 of 16 .,

28. Under established Texas case law, recusal is required not only for actual bias but also 
where procedural irregularities create an appearance of impropriety or reasonable doubt 
as to a judge's impartiality. See Sears v. Nueces County Sheriff Olivarez, 28 S. W.3d 611 
(Tex. App. 2000) . 
29. The Texas Supreme Court has emphasized that judges must strictly adhere to recusal 
procedures to preserve public. confidence in the judiciary. See In re Inquiry Concerning 
Honorable Bonnie Rangel, 677 S.W.3d 918 (Tex. 2023). 
CONCLUSION AND PRAYER FOR RELIEF 
30. Based on all the foregoing facts, I respectfully assert that Judge David L. Evans has 
demonstrated a pattern of disregard for the mandatory recusal procedures established by 
Texas law, creating both an appearance of impropriety and reasonable doubt as to his 
impartiality in handling matters related to my case. 
31. His failure to adhere to the clear requirements of Rule 18a, combined with his explicit 
approval of non-neutral staff handling sensitive recusal materials in contravention of the 
rule's plain language, constitutes grounds for recusal under Texas law. 
32. I respectfully request that this Honorable Court: 
a. Grant the motion to recuse Judge David L. Evans; 
b. Effectuate an immediate stay of these proceedings to preserve the integrity of 
the Texas judiciary; 
c. Provide interim relief pursuant to Rule l 8a(g)( 4) that restores my property 
interests; 
d. Require the Petitioner and her counsel to provide a written response to the 
allegations contained herein; and
