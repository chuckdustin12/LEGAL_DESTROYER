Munford signed April 29, \n2025, referring a Motion to Recuse and First Amended Motion to Recuse filed by Charles Dustin \nMyers in the above-referenced matter. \nAfter reviewing the motion and amended motion, I find that the motion and amended \nmotion are based solely on the judge's rulings in the case under Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a (a) (3), and, \neven assuming they are not, the motions fail to state with detail and particularity facts that are \nwithin the affiant's personal knowledge, or on information and belief, that would be admissible in \nevidence and that, if proven, would be sufficient to justify recusal of Judge Munford on any ground \nspecified in Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b (b), as required by Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a (a)(4). \nTHEREFORE, having concluded that the motion and amended motion seeking to recuse \nJudge Munford fail to comply with Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a (a), I summarily deny the motions in this \nmatter, without a hearing, pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. \nSIGNED this 19th day of May, 2025. 1 \nPage 1 of 1 322-744263-23\nFILED\nTARRANT COUNTY\n5/20/2025 10:22 AM\nTHOMAS A. WILDER\nDISTRICT CLERKM.3898 M.3898\nM.3898 M.3898 M.3898 M.3898",
