§ IN THE DISTRICT COURT 
322ND JUDICIAL DISTRICT 
TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
ORDER DENYING OBJECTION TO ORDER OF ASSIGNMENT DATED MAY 6, 2025 
AND THE OBJECTION DATED APRIL 29, 2025 
Came on to be considered the Objection to Order of Assignment Dated May 6, 2025, and 
the Objection dated April 29, 2025 that were filed Charles Dustin Myers in the above-entitled 
cause. 
Mr. Myers complains of the court coordinator's involvement in the recusal process. A 
Court Coordinator's duties include assisting the administrative judges. See Tex. Gov't Code Ann. 
§ 74.102(b) which provides as follows: 
To promote uniform and efficient administration of justice in this state, the court 
coordinators shall cooperate with regional presiding and local administrative 
judges and state agencies having duties in the area of the operation of the courts. 
The court coordinators and clerks work together to assist the trial judges and the 
administrative judges. Only the judges, not the litigants, have the authority to direct the activities 
of the court coordinators and clerks. Mr. Myers' objections regarding the involvement are 
overruled. 
Mr. Myers also objects to the referral by Judge Kaitcer of a motion to recuse (Kaitcer 
recusal motion) to the undersigned. This objection is overruled. However, the judge who hears

the Kaitcer recusal motion may take into consideration Mr. Myers' claim that he did not file a 
motion to recuse Judge Kaitcer. 
The Court, having considered the objections is of the opinion that the objections should 
be DENIED. 
IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Objection to Order of Assignment Dated May 
6, 2025 and the Objection filed on April 29, 2025 are DENIED. 
SIGNED this 15th day of May, 2025.
