A \nCourt Coordinator's duties include assisting the administrative judges. See Tex. Gov't Code Ann. \n\u00a7 74.102(b) which provides as follows: \nTo promote uniform and efficient administration of justice in this state, the court \ncoordinators shall cooperate with regional presiding and local administrative \njudges and state agencies having duties in the area of the operation of the courts. \nThe court coordinators and clerks work together to assist the trial judges and the \nadministrative judges. Only the judges, not the litigants, have the authority to direct the activities \nof the court coordinators and clerks. Mr. Myers' objections regarding the involvement are \noverruled. \nMr. Myers also objects to the referral by Judge Kaitcer of a motion to recuse (Kaitcer \nrecusal motion) to the undersigned. This objection is overruled. However, the judge who hears",
