Kaitcer signed April 29, \n2025, referring a Motion to Recuse and First Amended Motion to Recuse filed by Charles Dustin \nMyers in the above-referenced matter. \nAfter reviewing the motion and amended motion, as well as the Objection to Order of \nAssignment dated May 6, 2025 in which the movant claims that he did not file a motion to recuse \nAssociate Judge Kaitcer, I find that, based on the substance of said motions and movant's own \nadmission that he is not seeking to recuse Associate Judge Kaitcer, the referred motion and \namended motion do not comply with Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a (a). \nTHEREFORE, having concluded that the motion and amended motion referred by Judge \nKaitcer do not comply with Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a (a), I summarily deny the motions in this matter, \nwithout a hearing, pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a,(g (3)(A). \nSIGNED this 19th day of May, 2025 \nPage 1 of 1 322-744263-23\nFILED\nTARRANT COUNTY\n5/20/2025 10:22 AM\nTHOMAS A.
