IN THE MATTER OF THE 
MARRIAGE OF 
MORGAN MICHELE MYERS 
AND 
CHARLES DUSTIN MYERS §

AND IN THE INTEREST OF MARA § 
MYERS AND CAROLINE MYERS, § 
MINOR CHILDREN § IN THE DISTRICT COURT 
TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS 
322nd JUDICIAL DISTRICT 
ORDER SUMMARILY DENYING MOTION FOR RECUSAL 
Before me is an Order of Referral from the Honorable Jeffrey N. Kaitcer signed April 29, 
2025, referring a Motion to Recuse and First Amended Motion to Recuse filed by Charles Dustin 
Myers in the above-referenced matter. 
After reviewing the motion and amended motion, as well as the Objection to Order of 
Assignment dated May 6, 2025 in which the movant claims that he did not file a motion to recuse 
Associate Judge Kaitcer, I find that, based on the substance of said motions and movant's own 
admission that he is not seeking to recuse Associate Judge Kaitcer, the referred motion and 
amended motion do not comply with Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a (a). 
THEREFORE, having concluded that the motion and amended motion referred by Judge 
Kaitcer do not comply with Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a (a), I summarily deny the motions in this matter, 
without a hearing, pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a,(g (3)(A). 
SIGNED this 19th day of May, 2025
