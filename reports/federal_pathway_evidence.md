Selected research excerpts (argument framing, non-filing research artifacts):
- THEORETICAL PATHWAY TO FEDERAL RELEIEF: "Federal courts are generally barred from enjoining ongoing state divorce proceedings, but there are extremely narrow exceptionssuch as when a federal statute expressly authorizes intervention or when constitutional due process violations render the state process fundamentally voidthough these are rarely met and require extraordinary..." (extracted_research/THEORETICAL PATHWAY TO FEDERAL RELEIEF.txt).
- 42 U.S.C. 1983 complaint outline: "The facts described support a strong claim for deprivation of property without due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, as Texas law and binding precedent require notice and an opportunity to be heard before a person is ordered to vacate their home or business.

(extracted_research/vLex-Vincent-42-U-S-C----1983-Complaint-for-Injunctive-and-Declaratory-Relief-Introduction-Plaintiff-Charles-Dust-1.txt).
- Civil RICO complaint draft: "This civil RICO complaint establishes how the defendants formed an enterprise engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity, demonstrating continuity, intent, and a common goal through evidence including text messages, financial records, and court documents. The complaint seeks treble damages and injunctive relief under 18 U.S.C." (extracted_research/vLex-Vincent-Draft-a-civil-RICO-complaint-based-on-the-provided-facts--establishing-the-existence-of-an-enterpris-1.txt).
- Diversity jurisdiction research: "A victim can sue in federal court under diversity jurisdiction for state law claims like fraud, misrepresentation, or intentional infliction of emotional distress as the $90,000 damages sought exceeds the $75,000 threshold required by 28 U.S.C.  1332, provided the parties are citizens of different states." (extracted_research/vLex-Vincent-What-claims-can-be-made-in-federal-court-under-diversity-jurisdiction-if-a-victim-sues-a-perpetrator-1.txt).
- Exhaustion and mandamus volume: "Federal courts may intervene under 42 U.S.C.  1983 when state remedies are ineffective or unavailable, particularly where there is a persistent denial of relief for alleged violations of federally protected rights, as recognized in Mitchum v." (extracted_research/vLex-Vincent-The-father-has-exhausted-all-available-state-remedies--including-six-mandamus-petitions--and-has-bee-1.txt).
